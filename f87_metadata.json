    "text": "Hey Guys,Has anyone done their differential and manual transmission fluid flushes yet? I know a few F8X guys have done this already, but my question was if you guys have used non oem fluids.I know the m2 requires MTF-LT-5 for the manual transmission and SAF-XJ rated fluid for the differential, and bmw has stated that an equivalent like castrol's 75W140 syntrax LSD would be ok for the diff. Has anyone used this before?Thanks--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit - 20/04/22So from the time I created this thread until now I have learned alot about differential oil on this platform and its availability. So here is a brief summary:1) You should use MSP/A if you can get it, this is what bmw stipulates to use via ista, real oem (their etk which real oem displays), and their differential recall tsb.2) I have realized that MSP/A is not available in the USA, so if you're in the US I would recommend to use SAF-XJ (not SAF-XJ + FM), the difference probably isn't huge and you should be absolutely fine with this. This might be the case in Canada as well, as I am hearing MSP/A is no longer available here. So alot of the earlier information I posted was deemed to be not fully accurate on this matter, because I was not aware MSP/A is not at all available in the USA. So if you cannot get MSP/A use SAF-XJ don't feel obligated to get it if you can't find it.3) Check your dealer invoice after the break in service, I have seem some cases where dealers are using SAF-XO fluid for the fluid change. This is fluid meant for open differentials and not limited slip diffs like what we have in our cars. So please ensure you don't have"

This is fluid meant for open differentials and not limited slip diffs like what we have in our cars. So please ensure you don't have this fluid as it can cause severe damage, as it isn't the proper weight and doesn't have the required friction modifiers that the clutch packs require.4) This is an iffy one, but I would stay clear of aftermarket fluids if possible. I keep seeing stories of how fragile these diffs are and failing prematurely, some due to clutch packs wearing out early, some due to SAF-XJ +FM fluids being used (E9X m3 specified diff oil) - which is scary because some aftermarket differential oils are also suitable for the e9x m3 which makes me worried that it might have too much friction modifiers for our F8X diffs. so I would probably stick with OEM fluids for now.\n\nI changed mine myself at 9,700 miles and used BMW fluid for warranty reasons.

I think they did this because too many people kept using SAF-XJ + FM which damaged the diff and was only mean for the E9X M cars.Anyways on a different note I was wondering if anyone used the approved aftermarket oils.

    "text": "First-time poster here. I’m the original owner of a 2019 M2 Competition, which I’ve had for about six years now. Around three years ago, I started noticing a clicking/ticking noise coming from the engine bay. The intensity and loudness vary—sometimes it’s barely noticeable, while other times it’s impossible to ignore, as you can hear in the attached video.I might be imagining this, but I swear the car feels noticeably smoother and more responsive when the noise isn’t present—unfortunately, that doesn’t happen very often.One possible trend I’ve noticed: if the car has been sitting in the garage unused for a while, the sound doesn’t appear right away after I start driving. However, if I turn the engine off and then back on mid-trip, the noise tends to return. I’m not 100% certain about this, but it’s the only pattern I’ve observed.The service center in San Francisco repeatedly denied hearing the noise when I brought the car in for service, both when it was in and out of warranty. However, when I finally showed them the attached video—where it’s impossible to ignore—they dismissed it as “normal” and not a cause for concern.I’ve scoured various forums, and the closest matching cases seem to attribute similar sounds to loose bolts. The car is completely stock with 18,000 miles, and I intend to keep it that way for decades to come.I’m at my wit’s end—I just want the car to consistently drive as smoothly as it does when the noise isn’t present.

You do not need to complete remove the caliper.]Below: I purchased the Giro Disc boots because they were available and shipped with the titanium brake shims I also planned to purchase. I can't comment on the quality of the boot, but I trust that Giro Disc will be providing at least OEM quality or better.Below is the condition of my dust boots after 7 HPDE weekends at Advanced/Instructor pace. I tapped the brakes a few times to get the pistons to moved outward so the grooves are extended out of the caliper. You don't need to move them out much.Below I liberally sprayed down the piston faces with brake clean and wiped it down to remove the large amount of caked on brake dust and contamination. I used a small screw driver to peel out the cracked boots. It take a little work, but eventually they come free.Below is new seals compared to oldBelow is installing the new seal. First make sure the caliper and piston groove is free of contamination. A simple wipe with a shop towel to getting the nooks and crannies is fine. You have to stretch the inner lip around the piston groove. I did not use any grease or lube. It probably would have helped, but it didn't seem to affect installation. The seals came out dry, so they went back in dry. The inner lip might roll a little bit, so I wiggled the seal fore and aft, and rotated it by hand to make sure the inter lip seated properly.

I guess for them lifetime ends when warranty expires.\n\nWell, probably look at changing it if you're heading towards 100k miles. It's fully synthetic, it isn't exposed to water, and there are no combustion products to worry about so it will last years without degrading. High/hard use will result in some wear to the innards of the gearbox however, so changing it will help keep any traces of worn metal out of the moving parts.I changed the transmission fluid on my e46 at 150k miles. It was not a good colour (completely black) and the shift action was much, much better afterwards. I've been running it on non filled for life stuff since with changes every couple of years to flush out the remains of the old fluid.\n\nOver the last 200,000 miles in my e92 328i and Acura TSX, I always changed the transmission fluid every 30,000 miles. And after every flush, the shifts always felt smoother. I think there's definitely some fluid degradation that happens. I use Redline MTL now and previously used GM Synchromesh FM in the Acura.I had my e92 in the shop this week and went ahead and had them do a transmission fluid flush even though my fluid was only 2 years and 20,000 miles old. And there was still a noticeable improvement in shift actions. It feels like the synchros aren't working"

I guess for them lifetime ends when warranty expires.That's basically it, the lifetime of the vehicle is the amount of time BMW expects the average person to own one of their cars before they replace it with a newer model. From that standpoint, their 'lifetime' fluids will last the lifetime of the vehicle. From a long term ownership standpoint, you should absolutely be changing your 'lifetime' fluids as part of yearly/mileage based routine maintenance. How often you do will depend on how you drive and may simply be based on mileage or something you'll want to do every year regardless of mileage (e.g. if you track the car, you really should be changing transmission fluid at least once each season).Once I finally get my M2, I do intend on replacing the transmission fluid around the same time I get my break in service done and regularly thereafter. It's cheap insurance for a car I intend to own for a very long time. Plus I plan on sending a sample off for analysis so I have a baseline to work with for future reference.\n\nNever thought of this and I intend to keep my car a long"

Cheap magnetic drain plugs can also have incorrect thread pitches and diameters that will result in damage to your oil pan threads. These cheap magnetic drain plugs can also utilize cheap neodymium magnets that loose their magnetic abilities at temperatures lower than what your engine oil gets to during operating conditions, this means that the magnetic drain plug will let go of all the metal debris it has stuck to until it cools down meaning it is essentially useless. The turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug address all of these issues and provides a magnetic drain plug that has no flaws that a cheaper plug or even a more expensive drain plug may have.

There are a few reasons for this, but one reason is cheaply made plugs often found on aliexpress can have the incorrect thread pitch or bolt diameter leaving your oil pan threads stripped (and if you own an ///M vehicle the oil pans are $1000 USD so it is best not to risk it), more on this later on. Another reason is because the weaker brass and aluminium drain plugs are susceptible to breaking at quite low torque specs and this can leave the end of the plug stuck in the oil drain pan threads resulting in a huge hassle to extract this portion of the bolt.Here are some examples of this:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...84&postcount=7This m2"

This is an important metric because if the yield strength is too low you can end up stretching a drain bolt over and over again while torquing a plug resulting in its fatigue and eventual failure.Tensile Strength: How much force a bolt is able to resist in its axial (lengthwise) direction before failing aka snapping/breaking.Before we go into"

    "text": "Has anyone replaced their engine mounts yet?My left motor mount released the hydraulic fluid recently, so I need to replace it. Since one failed, Im actually planning to do both mounts. I did some Google and YouTube searching to see if I could find a good DIY, but didnt have much luck for M2 or 2 series, and just a few 3 or 4 series results.Anyway, Im trying to decide whether I want to DIY or farm it out, and was curious if anyone has replaced theirs. If you have, what had to be removed to get to them? If just the charge pipe, belly pan, dust shield and/or fender liners, Im good with that, no big deal, but hoping not to go much deeper for access.I already have the mounts, the bolts for the engine to the bracket, bracket to the subframe, and nut for the mount to the bracket, in addition to both mounts and a set of Bimmerworld inserts to stiffen them up a bit and hopefully prolong this set of mounts. My M2 is primarily a track toy at this point, but Im not interested in urethane or solid mounts.Oh, and I also already have a hoist or engine support bar to get the engine up off the mounts.\n\nYou can watch turbo install videos to get an idea of what you generally need to do (on the passenger side). Most of the time people who install stage 2 turbos remove the passenger side motor mount to get access to the turbo. Other than that ISTA would also explain what you need to do.Also keep us posted if the motor mount inserts fit, I am not 100% sure if the bimmer world stuff will fit because the m2 has weird motor mounts: the left side is shared with the f8x m4, the right side is a unique p/n for the n55 m2.

Good info on the mount differences as well. I’ll give them a trial fit on the new mounts and report back.M Fifty- no mods, car was stock other than an intercooler and charge pipe. I noticed the mount had ruptured when I had the belly pan off to do the downpipe a couple weeks ago. I happened to do rogue trans mounts at the same time, so all good there. The mount does not appear to have separated, the fluid bladder has just ruptured.As far as contributing factors, the car has somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 track days on it. Also it’s a manual transmission and I probably have flubbed more than a few heel-toe downshifts (inadequate throttle blip) as I was getting used to the car. It’s a 2018 with 37000 miles and was on track for the first time 2-3 days after the 1200 mile break in service. This is the first mechanical issue I’ve encountered, so can’t complain.Thanks for the linkZeese, my search efforts didn’t turn up much, or perhaps I passed over this thread when I saw it was about poly mounts.Link to what I’m going to try;https://www.bimmerworld.com/Aluminum...2-E9X-F3X.html\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by"

This has been *known* failure point as the aluminum bolt that holds the ground cable to the water pump fractures, and you lose your ground and as a result, you lose your water pump.What mustve happened is that when the ground boat failed somehow the pressure backed up and blew out the coolant return hose, which was probably weak also.So I would highly recommend changing the ground bolt to your water pump with a stainless steel one which is very easy to do because its accessible and right under the pulley accessible from under the car.Original post:Well, I was prepared, but not well enough.My 40,000 mile 2017 OG M2 blew its Coolant Return Hose 20 minutes ago.

This is a 5 minute fix if you have the part.My advice, get an extra hose and zip tie to the original so you can get yourself unstuck when it does blow!\n\nRecommended coolant return hose replacement:  every 4 years.\n\nThanks for the PSA! How many miles did you have on that hose before it broke?Ever since reading this thread,I carry a spare one of these in my trunk at all times.

I quickly replaced the hose and coolant.  Concerned that I wouldnt have enough battery power left to do the bleeding procedure, I drove off.It started to over heat, so I stopped and tried to do the coolant bleed procedure, but after about 20 seconds of pressing in the gas, the pump would not come on.So I limped home keeping the water temperature under 250 degrees F, and the oil temp under 220 degrees F.Hopefully I didnt do any damage to the engine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongMy coolant hose was the original, 7 years old, 40,000 miles.Hmm Im at 7 years and 44K miles."

Rolling into the throttle youd get hesitation and then power would hit. Almost like the wastegate was having a seizure. This showed up in data logs in the rpm and boost trace. Checking the wastegate calibration returned nothing. All healthy. Suspected potentially a warped wastegate flap.Code went away after clearing it and only returned once after that, in nearly the identical spot on the drive home.While I never smoke tested the car to absolutely id the root cause, it was totally resolved after upgrading intercooler and replacing the turbo to intercooler pipe and the charge pipe that came with the Wagner Evo3 I installed so its safe to assume it was a simple boost leak.Leaving this here as a clue for anyone that may have a similar issue in the future as there wasnt a ton of threads on this aside from a guy solving it by replacing a DV.

    "text": "OK, I promised several folks here I would post the UOA of Motul 300V, which did not have any track time this time.Racing oils like 300V are not the best choice for street use. But I had plenty of this oil (new formula, current one), and I did not have time to track the car. But that made me interested in how this oil does during daily driving. I know folks in other forums are interested in this, so share it with them.1. Oil did not oxidize at all. This is an exceptional oxidation result even for street oil, let alone racing oil, which is testimony to the quality of base stocks and polymers.2. This oil is packed with wear protection additives! ZDDP is really high, and I would say it is right at the border of being street-acceptable. Moly is also very high.3. Calcium is lowered in the new version to be more LSPI \"friendly.\"4. KV100 is really, really good. It is at 12.79cst, while it starts at 13.5cst. HTHS of this oil is 4.1cP. Such high HTHS, in relation to a relatively thin KV100 for W40, suggests extremely high-quality base stocks.5. N52 is not as hard on oil as N55, S55, etc. But it gives you an indication of how oil performs. This is UOA, not used engine analysis, so don't pay attention to wear metals, although they are stubbornly the same as was always the case. Previous samples, one 0W40, are interesting. 0W40 had A LOT of track time. And not any track time, but sessions as long as 1 1/2hrs without pit stops and at 5,100ft altitude at 102f ambient temperature. 0W30 is strictly daily in winter, a lot of skiing driving,"

I do drive my car hard, all the time! But, I don't think that is anything extra taxing on an engine, and these results show that.7. The copper level here is just a bit higher. But take into consideration that different oils, especially ones based on ester, leach metals differently.So, before I got this UOA today, I would suggest people check Motul Power 5W40 if the vehicle does not see a lot of track. Now, I believe this 300V is \"streetable\" oil.If you choose to go with it, do it at your own risk, as it does not have any approvals whatsoever, including API.\n\nThoughts on the silicon level?Also, 300v 5w-40 is as thin as most 0w-40. Always worried me for a 450-475whp tuned N55 seeing hard track time in the summer (plus daily driving), so I ran 10w-40 bc it’s still thinner than oils like Redline 5w-40.\n\nSilicone is low, but it is from VANOS bolt recall.

The driveshaft is thicker where it needed to be installed. I ended up crudely milling mine to be wider and deeper, but it still didn't seat perfectly because of the tunnel shape.Overall, how it works is actually a great design, but for our cars the fitment is quite a ways off. I'd probably save your money on this one.Side note: I'd love to see someone fab something similar for our cars because it is an absolute PITA to keep the driveshaft from rotating while removing the diff nut.

So I got my second oil change 04/2019. I went recently to dealer to get my schedule maintainece but they said I'm not due till 7k more miles or April/2020? Is this correct? I tho it was 10k miles.

I want to keep my car well maintained so I don't get issues later down the roads. Thanks\n\nYou dealer is correct. The 4/2019 oil change was one year from the date of manufacture.  Your next oil change started out at 4/2020 or 10,000 miles from the last oil change which ever comes first.  The mileage of 10,000 miles from the last oil change is changed depending on your actually driving conditions.\n\nRegardless of the computer, I've opted to change the oil and filter in my non-tracked M2 roughly every 5,000 miles and only use Shell V-Power fuel. I always change it right before it goes into my non-heated garage for the three winter month (insurance discount for non-use).For winter storage, I use the following:CTEK MUS-4.3 battery tender (no longer available) which appears to be the same one BMW markets under their own name.

Synthetic oil easily lasts 10,000 miles or one year.\n\nExcerpt from Maintenance Schedule by Mike Miller of Bimmer and Roundel magazinesOnce BMW began paying for scheduled maintenance, lo and behold the schedule was revised. Now, magically, the cars hardly need any maintenance at all! The 1,200-mile break-in service was done away with except for M cars. Engine oil suddenly lasts 15,000 miles (dealers are supposed to use BMW synthetic oil).This is an alternative to BMWs factory-recommended maintenance schedule. It is not, Mike Millers maintenance schedule. It is actually BMWs maintenance schedule, more or less, which was used prior to Free Scheduled Maintenance. It also represents my opinion, based upon my experience and that of my readers, tech advisors, and professional BMW technicians both dealer and independent.Traditionally, BMW performed a break-in service at 1,200 miles on new cars, which included changing the engine oil and filter, manual gearbox oil or automatic transmission fluid, and differential oil. With the advent of Free Scheduled Maintenance, BMW stopped performing break-in services except on M cars.I have seen that the engine and driveline oils in new modern BMWs are literally full of metal at 1,"

If you are running BMWs oil, I recommend an oil and filter change interval between 5,000 and 7,500 miles.\n\nThey don't use Castrol anymore. BMW uses Shell/Pennzoil now.

The BMW service centers idea of what is ideal and what is actually ideal differs significantly. The onboarding servicing system is for soccer moms and people that are lazy and or dumb.

Its not hard, and requires only basic tools and youll pocket $200+ a lick. Google will lead you to diy oil change videos and how to reset the maintenance lights.- Run OEM oil or Pennzoil Platinum Euro 5W40 and change it every 3-5000mi with OEM Mann oil filters. All in DIY this is like $50.- Change your diff and trans fluids every 30-40k if not tracking the vehicle. Use OE fluid. Im running the appropriate Redline fluid with great results. Everyone has their opinion on which fluid is best for Trans/diff but you cant go wrong with these. As long as youre changing both regularly youre fine.- Brake fluid once every 12-18mo if not tracking. You can also DIY this with a pressure bleeder. Upgrade to Castrol"

QuickJack wanted to sell me the TL AND their frame extenders-- but that a) takes up a fair bit of room and b) isn't exactly cheap.So-- does the TLX work with a M2C?  I keep confusing myself with the measurements.TIA.R.\n\nIt's easy to check, grab a measuring tape and measure the distance between the jacking points. With the TLX I assume the primary concern would be that the inner distance between the two points will fit in the TLX's spec.You need to make sure the distance between the jack points is greater than the minimum distance specified in the TLX specs, I don't think there is much risk that the distance between the wheels is too small that the TLX frames would not fit in between.I have the SLX and frame extensions but haven't really checked if the M2 would fit on the extensions (although likely the stacked height with the extensions would make it a pain anyway). The one small benefit of the extensions for the Element and RDX would be the extra height in this case. Do keep in mind that with the higher ground clearance vehicles the QuickJack will be providing less lift.I would recommend getting the pinch weld blocks though, I feel much safer with them for Subarus, Hondas and Toyotas. I use a set of 4 rubber adapters for the BMWs with the including QuickJack rubber blocks and they're stable, I had tried eBay rubber adapters for pinch welds and had a Subaru come unbalanced. The included QuickJack rubber blocks are softer than the pinch weld blocks and I feel that probably makes them less stable.\n\nI measure the distance between the front and rear tires on"

The 5000TLX overall frame length is 76 inches.So, you should have around 5 inches of buffer  depending on your specific tires and wheels  with the TLX frames and your M2.Alternatively, if you park indoors in a private space: consider storing the frame extensions under a vehicle.

If you reuse a stretched bolt and restretch them as per bmw's torque spec you risk the bolt snapping. If you do not yield the bolt then you will not apply the correct amount of load and an even load onto the head of the bolt and threads, so chassis stiffness is not as it should be.Also water pump bolts are single use torque to yield as well.

    "text": "I have a 2018 factory stock OG M2, no mods.  I currently have approximately 12,000 miles on the spark plugs.  They were last replaced four years ago at 15,000 miles using the BMW free maintenance program.  My SA keeps wanting me to replace them because BMW recommends new plugs at every third oil change.  The car only has 27,500 miles on it, no track use.  When should these plugs be replaced?\n\nThe 'normal service' maintenance chart calls for plugs every 30k. If you are easy on the car, it could qualify for 'normal service'. However, most drivers of performance cars operate them under what is considered 'severe service' conditions.It is not unusual for specialists to tighten up maintenance intervals based on their experience and observations during repairs. Considering BMW oil change intervals are way too long it is likely the '3 oil changes' is approximately 22.5-30k depending on the specific shop.\n\nIf you're not tracking the car, go the complete 30K on the plugs and not worry about the time interval. The intervals on an M-car presumably would have some track time built into the maintenance intervals. The M235iR has 5,000 km spark plug change intervals, but no time interval exists. That is nearly 100% competitive racing mileage.\n\nThanks for the replies.  I thought it was 30,000 mi, but wasn't sure.  The car is \"exercised\" from time to time, but 12,000 miles plug change interval is a bit overkill."

I was wondering if you guys would recommend anything different (located in Tuscaloosa, AL so no snow or crazy weather).Lastly, what is an average price for a quality ceramic coating?

Lots of opinions on this. I change at 3000 or less as mine sees track time.The stock tires are great. You can move to PS4S when they wear out if youd like something with a bit more grip in exchange for response.Full detail, paint correction and ceramic coating figure ~$1600. PPF 3-5k depending on how much you do and who you use around these parts.Get an electric pressure washer and foam cannon along with some decent detailing products. Larry at Ammo NYC and Pan The Organizer have great detailing content on YouTube. Both have videos on their wash methods and detailing tips along with product recs you cant go wrong with.\n\nWelcome.Regarding oil, use a BMW Genuine M-filter and an oil with LL-01 or LL-01FE approval.

But other than that no special procedure just ensure the reservoir is topped up properly and make sure you check the clutch side carefullybto ensure its full as well.\n\nWhats a good interval for clutch fluid?\n\nI'd just do it with brake fluid because you're pretty much there anyways.

I fill to top of neck, bleed to bottom of neck or so, refill & repeat 3-4 times (obviously closing the bleed valve while line is pressurised).The clutch bleed valve needs a lot of loosening (compared to a brake caliper) before fluid will flow, first time you'll think it's not working.\n\nCar in for service tomorrow, getting brake fluid done as been a couple of years. But then I got thinking hmm does clutch fluid need replacing?2016 6MTjust never seen it routinely mentioned\n\nConsidering the huge pita it is if you introduce air by running the bleeder dry, I would consider the waste of a bit of brake fluid and cleaning just a necessary cost of using a bleeder.

I was glad to find this at fcp, becausee to me it works much better than the regular 'blue' store stuff.Perhaps related - I was warned when I bought mine to never ever use any of the ones containing silicone (usually orange, like RainX);  this apparently gels up the seals in the pumps and causes expensive failures.  OK to use the alcohol-based ones.  The dealer said they'd had so many of these cases that they warned new owners specifically (and then wouldn't cover it if you went ahead and jacked it up)."

(knowing of course it'll be much more costly to have them do it)It's not that hard to do as long as you don't mind crawling under the back of the car. If you park it somewhere with the nose pointed downhill, then you have enough space to scoot under the backside. Search the forums for \"exhaust flexing bow\", and you'll find the part number. Maybe $15. Read this post for a key detail when trying to install the flexing bow.https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1869651\n\nIf you don't want to mess with it, then I couldn't imagine a shop charging more than $150 to fix it. It might be about 15 minutes of work for someone with experience to fix it."

Thanks.Typically you should change the oil every XXXX km or 4-5 years whatever comes first, the reason why is because oil still oxidizes with time even if you do not drive it.Personally I change the diff oil every 4 years and 30k - 40k km (I prefer to keep it on the lower end of the mileage count to minimize the amount of metallic shavings in the oil as that contributes to wear) whatever comes first, in order to ensure the diff oil is as clean as possible to minimize differential wear. This is because our diffs (well atleast in the early days which was pre 2016 my) were known to fail quite alot (you can google it and see), either with fluid that had too much friction modifiers or due to hard driving. I think this has been mostly resolved, but I try to be as proactive as possible with mainteance to ensure the diff is as healthy as possible (runs clean oil and minimize the amount of metal particles in said oil). This is because fluid is cheap and diffs are not.\n\nYes.  It should be changed based on age, not mileage.  I personally run Red Line diff fluid in both my stock 3.15 FD DCT diff and my 3.62 FD multi-clutch DCT diff.   There are no noises and no issues with using Red Line diff fluid.\n\nI believe BMW specs a 5 year service interval for normal use, so your due.

Although they might look complicated from outside, it's a pretty simple MO and easy to diagnose..You can sell back the LED module, they move quickly on eBay...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDigitalMioSoI got the LED module and installed it, same issue.

I've recently removed my Clutch Delay Valve, and the difference in clutch action is amazing (see this thread:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1625114), but the purpose of this post is to address the topic of bleeding the system, because that's necessary if you remove the slave cylinder.BackgroundAs most of us know, the clutch hydraulic system shares the reservoir with the brakes, and is therefore topped up in the same way. The ISTA+ directions for bleeding the clutch say to use a pressure bleeder system like theMotiveorSchwaben. Many people use these positive pressure tools without filling the container, and simply keep an eye on the fluid level in the reservoir, refilling as needed.In order to save some money, I purchased the Motive European filler cap fitting only, and connected this to the small air compressor that I use for air-brushing, which also has a moisture trap and a regulator that I could easily set to 15 psi.Unfortunately, positive pressure bleeding without extra fluid in a tank doesn't work for the clutch. The other thing that doesn't work (unless you're really careful) is gravity bleeding by pumping the clutch pedal. I also tried using the Mityvac to vacuum bleed the system, but this also didn't work, for the same reason.The Root CauseThe root cause of the problem is that the brake / clutch fluid reservoir is designed so that if the clutch were to leak, the brakes wouldn't be affected, and vice versa. The brake system contains more fluid than the clutch, and is more important, so a larger reservoir is dedicated to the brake system.The problem with bleeding happens because the clutch reservoir is really small, about the size I've coloured in Blue in the diagram below; the Yellow outlet goes to the clutch master cylinder:So the reservoir volume for the"

If you use a pressure based system as I did, you'll totally purge the system!To make matters worse, if you don't look really carefully at the reservoir, like with a light under the back edge, you'll think it's full but the clutch section will be empty!The total amount you can push through without re-filling the reservoir to the very top above Max is only 30ml, equal to only about two pumps of the clutch pedalThe SolutionIf you're not reverse bleeding (see below), the most important thing to do is to keep topping up the reservoir. Also do not bleed to fast because even if the reservoir fluid level is high, it takes time for the fluid to flow from the brake side to the clutch side of the reservoir.My understanding is that the positive pressure bleeders from Motiv and Schwaben effectively push fluid into the reservoir, keeping it full at all times. This is why BMW recommends this approach, but youmustfill the bleed tool container.I was able to successfully bleed my clutch by opening the bleed nipple on the slave cylinder, and fully pressing and lifting (slowly) the pedal twice, then refil the reservoir, then pressing and lifting the pedal twice, then refilling etc. I think I probably did this about 30 times and it worked!

Once the system was full, I did apply positive pressure to the reservoir, being very very careful to look at the reservoir level. I'm not convinced this did anything, because I also removed my BMS clutch stop at this point as well.Reverse BleedingMany people have bought into a myth about how air bubbles are constantly rising, and have resorted to reverse bleeding - pushing fluid up to the reservoir through the system. I actually tried this with three tools, but none of them worked for me and simply resulted in a mess over the garage floor:Marinating syringeTrigger action oil can15 PSI airbrush compressor through aMityvaccontainer in reverseReverse bleedingshouldwork, as long as you have enough fluid to fill the system, but it's not because of the bubbles rising issue. I was never able to get enough pressure going up through the system to get any fluid into the reservoir, but if you can overcome this, it should be a good solution.Anything Else?If you have installed a BMS clutch stop, remove it before pumping the pedal. The clutch stop may not prevent clutch disengagement, but it will prevent full bleeding! You can re-install it once the bleeding is done, but only if you bleed fully.\n\nGreat post!Thanks, and sounds like a royal PITA.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byBroDozeGreat post!Thanks, and sounds like a"

I bit but canceled and got my money back.IF you don't drive hard enough to require brake replacement by then - probably not a good buy. Also not transferable to a subsequent owner if you sell, which is a big deal (or can be). Transferable only on 2022+ models per BMWUSA website.As for other 3rd party warranties - I'd avoid them all. ONLY possible exception would be tire & wheel coverage IF it's at a reasonable price and IF the roads are horrendous where you'll be driving.

It is free for as long as your warranty.  If you need a tow they will tow it to the nearest BMW dealer.\n\nAll the roadside/AAA type services draw from the same database.  Whoever is available and agrees to price terms they go with or whoever is available to do the job with the correct tow/flatbed.\n\nI have AAA mainly for the other car and discounts,  it really paid off when I had to rent a car for my son and hertz waived the young driver fees because of AAA discount\n\nI have always had AAA Plus because I want towing up to 100 miles (which might be my house rather than the nearest BMW dealer).  I also had AAA flatbed my previous BMW to a independent 45 miles away (rather than a BMW dealer 15 miles away) when the water pump failed.The cheapest AAA Basic plan forces you to go to the nearest AAA garage (or IIRC, 5 miles or some small distance)The most expensive plan includes a 200 mile tow.

Often, AAA owns or contracts with towers at higher pay rate than insurers or BMW. Time of day, location and weather are all important factors. I found myself with a flat a short time ago and was on the side of the road for 3 hours waiting on BMW arranged tow. When they arrived, they couldn't tow because my car was too low. Crazy, right? BMW knows what they are towing in advance. Called AAA and they were out 40 minutes later with the right equipment.I find AAA pays for itself with discounts or offsets enough at least. I would recommend them over insurance or BMW.\n\nTook over 3 hours for BMW roadside to rescue me. In NYC where tow trucks are everywhere. And their number didnt work for first hour trying to reach them.Job well done\n\n1 Tow out of pocket expense will pay for an annual AAA membership. At least the classic anyway.

I may give it a few more days and then contact the dealer to see about a warranty replacement. It has been extremely cold where I live as well.\n\nI dont think that's normal at all. It's an enclosed housing and water is getting in. A small amount of condensation from temperature changes may leave slight haze, but drops of moisture along the top like that?

No amount of airing by removing the big black caps on top of the headlight to using a hair dryer worked. I even lowered silica gel pouches into the area.But I do have a solution and so far 3 months in works 100%.Find a friendly body shop who has experience of removing the headlamp. It's tricky and you can break clips easily. I used my local official BMW dealer. They charged me £100 + 20% VAT.The guy was an ace and in 45 mins had the lamp out and handed to me. He checked for obvious signs but none. Sometimes if the headlamp gets knocked (whilst you are away) the mounting brackets break and let in water. Mine were intact. The car has to stay as they will drop the front bumper. I had a loan car and put the headlamp on the front seat, glass facing roof lining, glad there was a newspaper on the seat as I did not want to soil the free loan car. Very damp news paper after 30 mins. So it had residue water.Put oven at 50C on fan, place headlamp to dry for 60/90 mins. Do get your partners"

Do get your partners permission first. Now comes the fix. Got my plumber buddy to help. Buy good quality clear bathroom silicone. But first looking at the headlamp as fitted to the car, gently remove the black trim on top of lamp. Be gentle and it does come off. underneath this is the culprit. Mine was quite damp and dirty at the join. Clean and dry with tissue.Turn it over and underneath is another black plastic trim. remove and clean underneath.Now we checked all the joins and planned the next step. go over all joins with a thin layer of silicone, spray with water and then gently work into the the join of the clear plastic and the headlamp body. There are some minor ones so be thorough. then put a bit of silicone on the 2 black trims removed and stick them back.Return to oven for 60 mins. don't be tempted to go above 50C, in case you want to do a pizza whilst you wait.Took the lamp back to BMW dealer who was on standby and he fitted it in 75 minutes. and aligned the lamps too.so far it works even with a pressure cleaner.excuse the long story but wanted to answer all your questions.\n\nPage 187 of the drivers manual:\n\nWeek old car, hand washed a few times with a low power pressure washer 2300 psi AND"

Either I have the worst luck with this car or I'm just neurotic. I don't know.My local BMW dealership has had this car for over 3 weeks at this point in and out for a few issues. Car is 1 and a half year old, 13,500 miles.1. Driver sun visor fell out. That was resolved quickly and painlessly.2. Biggest headache of all. Dashboard rattle that they couldn't seem to figure out what it was. They have taken the dashboard, A pillar, and driver side door out multiple times over to finally I think find it. They've felt taped what seems to be everything, replaced AC vents, door handle, etc. This was said to be fixed a couple times, just for me to bring the car back again and again.3. One of those times I am leaving the dealership after the rattle has been \"fixed\" and a technician or someone accidentally tore a 2\" gash into my steering wheel. Oh well, guess I gotta come back and have them replace that. They did after it took a few days to arrive. No biggie.4. And just this time after the 2 week period of having the car with them, I think the dashboard rattle is resolved, and the clutch pedal was replaced. I think I'm good. I'm happy. Oh, what's that? Another gash in the steering wheel! Are you serious? LOL5. Now, I'm hearing a knocking sound twice so far after picking the car up in what seems to be the driver front suspension going over big bumps. What could this be?I don't even know what to do. I feel like stuff just keeps coming up with this car and I'm at a loss for what to do. I was already on the phone with BMW NA"

When I got mine and it was under warranty I took it to the dealer to have them install the updated brake dust shields. The rears required removal/replacement of the parking brake assembly and it took the tech an extra day to do it because he was struggling.When I get the car back, the parking brake neeeever felt quite the same. The pull was off. Didnt want to be the guy whining to a service manager that the FEEL of my parking brake pull isnt right so I let it be. Cut to 3yrs later, precisely one week before a track weekend and Ive got a rotational noise I cant pin down coming from the rear. I presumed just like you that something was caught in the dust shield.After thoroughly visually inspecting and removing pads I realized that wasnt it and it hit me F parking brake. So I pulled the brake juuuust a hair and spun the wheel and MF if that wasnt the same sound. Fortunately a hard yank of the e-brake and a hard release was enough to disengage everything and my noise is gone but, it definitely isnt completely addressed.YMMV. God speed.\n\nI had a similar problem like a ticking sound from the rear. Sometimes squeaking and clicking. And it ended up being a loose/ broken break pad ear.

Should I just finish up the job and that be it or should I replace the bolts in a few weeks when I can?If the bolts were torqued and yielded (torqued to a spec like 80 ft-lbs for example, then add an extra angle twist to it 90 degrees to stretch the bolt), then you need to replace them. This is because once a bolt is stretched, it is permanently deformed as it has gone past its elastic deformation stage and into plastic deformation making the deformation irreversible. This means the bolt is now stretched and it can no longer provide the correct clamping force that bmw expects when they calculated the torque + stretch angle, also the bolt once it has gone plastic is now weakened and if you try to stretch it again you risk snapping or shearing the bolt. This is a huge PITA because now you have to remove a broken bolt that could be stuck really deep inside of a hole which is never fun. So imo always replace single use bolts.If you must reuse a bolt, just apply the torque and don't yield it. So maybe do half or 1/4 of the stretch angle and leave it at that until you're able to replace the bolt.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceIf the bolts were torqued and yielded (torqued to a spec like 80 ft-lbs for example, then add an extra angle twist to it 90 degrees to stretch the bolt), then you need to replace them.

When I stopped and tried to operate the washer, there was no noise at all from the pump. I assumed the pump had probably failed, but went to top up the fluid anyway just in case (there was no low level alarm). After filling it up, everything started to work perfectly.I'm wondering if maybe the low lvl sensor has failed potentially and the tank was actually empty the whole time. Has this happened to anyone else?I have recently had a mouse in the engine bay, but as far as I could tell it only chewed through a bit of heat shield around a cable, and not through any wires, perhaps the sensor in question has been damaged by it?I'd appreciate any thoughts, thanks!\n\nThe washer jets individually have wires going to them, I don't know if they're defrosters?"

    "text": "Hi guys,I was doing my year 2 maintenance and flushed my entire brake system using the Motive pressure power bleeder but have introduced air to the last caliper because I ran out of brake fluid in the bank.While I was releasing old fluid, I started seeing air bubbles come out and suction sound indicating there's no more fluid left in the bleeder tank.I immediately tightened the bleeder screw and checked the brake cylinder and saw that it was empty (below minimum). Prior to starting, I made sure to fill it to \"Max.\"My question is, what should I do to correct this?Do I just fill the brake cylinder back to full and fill the bleeder tank, and finish off the flush, or would I have to start everything over again?Or did I cause an even more serious problem?I've heard to never let the brake cylinder run empty to avoid introducing air but I'm afraid that's what happened thus causing the air to come out while bleeding.FWIW, I never pressed the brake pedal the whole time I was doing the flush, not sure if it matters...Also, I'm concerned about air in the ABS system now and I'm not sure how to resolve that with ISTA+Thanks for your help\n\nIf you introduced air in the system you need to re-bleed everything including the ABS module. Bleeding the ABS module is done via ISTA.\n\nYou will need to run a lot of fluid through the system to clear the air. I ran my reservoir empty while trying to use the ABS process in ISTA after rebuilding my calipers, I think I ended up running a total of 1-1.5L through and was able to get a solid pedal again.You will want to basically go around the car on each corner at least twice, the first time around was basically as I would for a complete fluid swap with the exception of not really trying to empty the reservoir with a pump/syringe first"

Then after you finish your first cycle around, go back and check again, this time only really open the bleed screw to see if you get any air and allow a small amount to flow through if you don't see any bubbles. Also perhaps if you can easily do a test drive, you can check for a soft pedal, and then do a final check on each corner again.Do be careful about not opening the bleed screw too far and having air come in through the threads of the bleed screw, trying to hurry the process by opening the bleed screw wide can just make everything take longer. This is when I would have hated to be working on jack stands, my QuickJack doesn't give the quickest or easiest access but it's 5-10 minutes to lift the car, take all the wheels off and then put them back on, drop the car and torque and be able to test drive.\n\nI totally understand how you feel.  I was doing a quick caliper bleed before a track weekend, and didn't bother filling the pressure bleeder.  Just watching the reservoir.  Then I dropped the wrench to close the bleeder, and by the time I retrieved it from under the car and got the bleeder closed I had air in the system.If you tried to rebleed that line without touching anything, youmighthave gotten lucky and just refilled the path. But if you touch the brake pedal, that's it, you are going to have to do the full ABS cycle bleed.I had to do the ABS bleed process 4 times before I finally got rid of the soft pedal.

(I use Pentosin LV in the off-season.)  Don't be using expensive racing fluid.  You can always reflush with the good stuff after the brakes are solid again.If you have access to ISTA, it does a nice job of walking you through the whole process with illustrations.  But you don't need it.  Most of the better active/bi-directional scan tools with BMW aware software can do the ABS cycle flush.  I use the Schwaben scan tool (a rebranded Foxwell NT510 w BMW add-on), and I'm fairly sure Bimmerlink will do it (but you should research that).One odd thing is that the ABS bleed does not do all four corners.  It just does the left front and left rear.  That is why it is critical to do a full normal flush before doing the ABS flush.  The 'left side only' confused me with with the scan tool at first, so I found ISTA.  And it does the same thing, but with better explanations.  The procedure is a bit complex.  It's a good idea to go through the process without actually opening bleeders just to get the sequence down.  It can help if you have two people.  One to run the process and push the pedal.

This job isn't flashing the car with anything so even if the car shuts off you'll be fine. Make sure you have the driver side seat belt plugged in while you're doing this so the car doesn't go to sleep.\n\nYou shouldn't really run into an issue if the battery is fully charged before you start, the ABS bleed procedure shouldn't take too long.What you do need to watch for is ensure the fluid doesn't run low. I ran into issues when I tried to simply fill the reservoir to the top, then put my Motive PowerBleeder on at 15psi and run through the process. If I tried again I would put 500mL to 1L in my PowerBleeder.

This can be used to actively charge the battery like a power supply and keep it at full conditions, and in such a case we are using it to try and slow the loss of battery charge while we are using it to actuate the ABS pump or perform flash tuning. Obviously 7 AMPS is not enough to keep the battery from draining but it will slow the drain and give us more time to acomplish our task. That is why we are using supply mode."

    "text": "Introduction:In this short post we will briefly discuss how a serpentine belt wears on these modern day bmw engines, what happens when a belt fails, and the importance of routine belt wear checks and preventative maintenance. Before we begin I must thank ECS tuning/Turner motorsports for giving me a partial discount on the products that I will be using in this review, however I will be as unbiased as possible despite that.Disclaimer:Any technical advice, installation instruction, or product installation is done so at your own risk I will not be responsible for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being(s), or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.How a modern day continental belt wears:So for those of you that do not know, these modern day continental serpentine belts that bmw uses are made from a new compound that no longer cracks when these belts age. This means that a visual inspection for belt wear no longer works to judge belt life, instead these belts wear thinner as they are used - just like car tires. This means you must measure rib height to determine belt life, and even rib spacing (due to wear from the grooves on the pulley and potential stretching). This measurement can be done with a cheap tool that continental makes called the contitech belt wear tester tool (more on this later). So if you hear people say this belt looks good referring to it being relatively clean and free of cracks and they did not use a continental belt wear tester"

So if you hear people say this belt looks good referring to it being relatively clean and free of cracks and they did not use a continental belt wear tester - their judgement is inaccurate and doesnt signify belt health at all.Continental Belt Wear Tester Images:Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceWhat happens when a serpentine belt fails:When a serpentine belt fails it can wrap itself around the harmonic dampener which then in turns sucks the belt behind it and forces it past the front crank seal. From there the timing chain sprocket and oil pump sprocket chews up the serpentine belt and some of that belt material gets carried up into the head via the timing chain. The parts that do not get pulled up into the head gets fed into the oil pan where it can clog up the oil pump pick up causing catastrophic engine damage and if the engine hasnt failed yet a costly repair would be required, more on this in this thread:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1807187where I discuss this issue indepth and also discuss a solution to permanently prevent any engine damage from belt  failures. But this is a quick summary on what happens when a belt fails.How to check belt wear and when to replace these belts:So how do we prevent serpentine belt failures from occurring? Well the first method to tackle the belt failing is commonly checking the belt for wear (this will not eliminate all belt failures caused by other issues as discussed in this thread:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1807187).

Thanks for the insight.\n\nI wonder if this has somthing to do with it, I thought it was only a rumor.Caster is a bit harder to conceptualize, but it’s defined as the angle created by the steerings pivot point from the front to back of the vehicle. Caster is positive if the line is angled forward, and negative if backward.Typically, positive caster will make the vehicle more stable at high speeds, and will increase tire lean when cornering. This can also increase steering effort as well.Most road vehicles have what is called cross-caster. Cross castered vehicles have slightly different caster and camber, which cause it to drift slightly to the right while rolling. This is a safety feature so that un-manned vehicles or drivers who lose steering control will drift toward the side of the road instead of into oncoming traffic.\n\nMine definitely pulls to the right.

Didn't buy it, I was 100% sure it wasn't like that before (the car was at ~55kkm) and insisted they check it on the lift. They found the transmission mount was starting to break and that if I wanted they could replace it under warranty. I agreed and after the repair, I couldn't reproduce the \"double push\" again.They also said that there was very little play in the axle shafts but nothing out of spec that should be addressed. I was happy that I no longer felt the \"double push\" and didn't pursue this.I feel like something is loose/there is more play now (now at 60kkm and warranty about to expire) and gonna take it to BMW but wanted to ask a few questions, fellow forum users:1.

It doesn't happen when rolling and lifting off the throttle.

Thank you!\n\nI probably could've done some due diligence and searched before posting; something I'm clearly a hypocrite of in this instance and generally recommend others to do as well.From Pennzoil themselves:Quote:Motor Oil Bottle Storage – At home, motor oil should be stored in a clean, dry place such as a cabinet or shelf. Make sure to check older motor oil to see if it is still good and on the specification for your vehicle’s engine even if it is the proper viscosity grade.Pennzoil Platinum motor oils can have a shelf-life of up to four years if stored properly.Old motor oil should be properly disposed of if no longer useable....Additionally, please keep in mind that in a home or garage,the recommended storage temperature for motor oil is between 40 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It is best to make sure it is not kept in a location where it can get too cold or too hot to maintain the lifespan of the motor oil.Reference:https://www.pennzoil.com/en_us/educa...l-storage.htmlLooks like I'm going to dispose it, since my garage has definitely seen temperatures under 40F (~4C)."

    "text": "My windshield wiper pump just stopped working and only when I started to do some research did I see the warning about not using certain washer fluid solutions. Too late. Anyway, I bought a new pump and filter screen and watched the few videos online regarding how to access and replace a failed pump. Unfortunately, the few online videos  show the three series. It's a real blister and poster child for poor design because you need to remove the front passenger wheel and unscrew the wheel well protective panels first. The washer fluid tank that the pump is mounted in is tucked behind the forward body panel. I got that far, but unfortunately, there seems to be some differences in the placement and design in the F22 vs the three series models. The videos show the owners just removing one 10mm screw and tilting the reservoir forward to access the bad pump. Has anyone attempted this maneuver in the two series? It appears the base of the tank is anchored which is one difference and totally inaccessible, as far as I can see. It also seems to be attached at the top to the input feed where you add the fluid. Logically it would seem you need to unfasten that feed tube also before the tank would allow you to tilt it forward. I don't want to snap or crack the tank itself to create a whole new problem. I've seen ridiculous repair quotes online to fix something so simple on any other car and as many simple fixes it's just time and labor intensive if you're aware of the correct sequence and simple tricks. Any input would be greatly appreciated! I have a 2015 228i.\n\nWhat did you end up doing to fix the washer fluid pump? I tried to access the reservoir but not finding a solution (I have a M2 so the fitment should be similar to yours).\n\nIt's not rocket science just labor intensive. First you need to jack the car up.

Don't recall if it's Torx screws or Allen heads or ratchet heads.  but you'll see under there. There might be other threads noting the tools so you'll have them all before you start. The wiper fluid container is in a narrow reservoir wedged between the cars metal body. You slide that out and the fluid pump is a small plastic part located in the bottom of the reservoir. Then it's just unplug it, replace and reassemble. The pump was only a few dollars. Sorry I'm not giving exact instructions, just hopped in my car from a long plane ride. Again, it's a bozo engineering move to locate that assembly where they did but so be it. It takes some patience and labor but really wasn't technical or difficult. Hope that helps at least a little."

I was expecting the gauge to move halfway back to the max level.  But there was no change.  I didn't add any more to avoid the more serious overfilled condition.So I just gave up.  If the car needs oil, it will tell me.  It burns about %20 of (max-min) every 5000 so I just change the oil and live with it.I track the car and this drives me crazy.

The fact that it's able to freeze the condensation to the point that no air is able to pass through indicates the gas is likely fine.  The fix that BMW published with the link above show they relocate the temperature sensor so that it can detect freezing.My problem is that you need specific circumstances to reproduce.  For me blasting through canyons in 105 degree weather seems to be the best way to experience the problem.  Exactly what I bought the car for.\n\nFrom the f30 forums and the TSB linked in my first post, I see they fit a temperature sensor spacer and flash a lower temp to the AC.  It's a $1.50 part and 15 minutes of work.  Does anyone know if"

Wondering if anyone has some ideas/thoughts/suggestionsIt looks to me like all the oil is downwind from the drain plug. Checked and it was definitely tight. Wondering maybe if it's a bad rubber seal/crush washer.All this to say, really trying to figure out what best case/worst case scenarios are in order to effectively purchase this car.\n\nLooks like 6MT, not a DCT. There are no rubber seals or metal crush washers on the fill/drain plugs on these transmissions. Its just a metal plug to metal case seal.From the photos, it definitelylookslike the drain plug is leaking. Maybe the plug is damaged in some way and not sealing properly? The plugs are pretty inexpensive to replace:https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw...ug-23127602815\n\nIf the car doesn't make any noise, you can drain the oil and check how much it has, if it doesn't need much you can buy it, change the oil and put a new drain plug.Before draining the oil, clean the drain plug with a brake cleaner and take a good look at it, there are no cracks around the plug.\n\nThanks for the replies!Took a closer look and couldnt see any oil coming down the side, so dont think its the shaft seal. Its in with BMW now, we shall see what they say.\n\nThey feel pretty confident its just a bad transmission plug. 👍 Thanks"

Shifting gears (specifically, 3-2 and 1-2) feels incredibly notchy. I'm not slam shifting, my foot is down all the way, and I have rev match in Sport+ (90% of my driving). I never WOT in 1st, and I always wait 10-15 minutes for the car to warm up before shifting faster and higher in the rev range.

I had a friend who's experienced with manuals take it for a test drive and he said it was totally fine. Nevertheless, I still want to do something about this since it's a somewhat new car with under 30k miles. I feel like this shouldn't be happening.I'm interested in changing the transmission fluid with Redline DCTF (1.6L IIRC). I'm also considering doing the diff fluid with Redline 75W140 (not certain how much to use).Can anyone who's made this change tell me how it affected your car?

Some indications of failed synchros would be resistance between gates as well as crunching and grinding.Everything is completely stock. The shift action has no resistance, the best way I would describe it is 3rd gear feels like there's a click when going from 2-3.3-2 can sometimes feel 'crunchy' where there's three or four of these clicks but still easy to get into gear and no noise unless I have the windows up and no music playing. There's no grinding sound from the transmission, only a grinding/notchy sensation when moving the shift knob into gear. I've also found that 1-2 is smooth when shifting in the 3-4k range and giving it an extra .5 seconds to let the synchros catch up.\n\nNo matter what, 1st to 2nd is never going to feel like butter. Due to gear ratio etc. I noticed the same 2-3rd (clunk) your talking about and I just got used to it over time but  theres nothing wrong with it. If you wanted to smooth that out you could do a ssk but I dont really think its worth it.\n\nA transmission fluid change, even as early as 30K miles, can make a noticeable difference.

I'm not sure it's outside of the normal range for these transmissions though. They just don't shift like a Miata.\n\nI'm thinking a fluid change at the very least should help. If you want to take it a step further then the Rogue Engineering transmission mounts may help even further.These transmissions tend to move around a bit so the transmission mounts should help to mitigate some movement. They're cheap enough (about $60) and easy to do.\n\n+1 to the comments above.Transmission fluid make a major improvement, even at 8,000km doing new stock fluid made a world of a difference. Like it was unreal how much better the car shifted. I have also heard nothing but good"

AGA tools owns ~50% of AGM, they share the same building and office space, and you can essentially think of AGA tools as the road car repair tools vendor (specializing in BMW repair tools) and AGM as the off road vehicle parts vendor.

Please note, the dynamics of this relationship was that I reached out for a sponsorship review and not the other way around, this should demonstrate how I truly feel about the jack rod - in the sense that I truly believe it is an incredibly ingenious and useful tool, and would absolutely use it myself (in fact I am using it as I write this review, and I am using it to help me install some mud flaps - which I will be talking about in another review).Shipping, Customer Service, and Packaging:The first few things I would like to discuss is the shipping, Customer service, and packaging that I experienced when acquiring the jack rod.So customer service, customer service was very good, Kyle from AGM answered all of my questions promptly, was professional, courteous and extremely knowledgeable about the products I inquired upon (in this case the jack rod). When he didnt know the answer, he would contact the engineering department to get the answers for me - so props to Kyle for going above and beyond to help me. So overall customer service was great, no complaints here.Next shipping, the shipping experience was very good. I had the order placed around maybe 2PM PST"

I do the following:Oil change at 3k miles because of track use, otherwise I do 5k on all my past and current turbo BMWs. Engine air filter at 15k. Diff and trans are perfectly fine for 50k/5years on street driving. I probably will follow this with track driving too. 30k is fine for plugs with street driving. Id say 50-60k is a good idea for the water pump, coolant, and overflow hose. I’ve had BMWs long enough to have all this crap happen to me on different cars lol. But I wouldn’t change the coolant just by itself, just wait till you proactively or reactively replace something else. I don’t know much about the “mickey mouse” thing so can’t offer much guidance.Belts and pulleys, just replace when the bearing starts making noise. This is more of a wear out failure. Same with the OFHG, just replace it when you notice some weepage. As for the charge pipe, you are due already! My factory pipe blew at like 20k miles under warranty!

So if anyone in Canada wants to buy a relabeled techron (because you can't buy actual techron in Canada because it is not labeled in French and the labelling laws prohibit this iirc) the only option left seems to be the hyundai fuel system cleaner (which is relabeled techron):Source:https://bobistheoilguy.com/forums/at...90-jpg.113897/I will be checking if any of my local dealers has this available."

That would put me at 6.75\". Low profile long reach jacks all look too tall in the frame/pivot area around 7.5\".I currently don't have a jack and would prefer to only buy 1 jack and 4 stands.Anyone have any recommendations?Also looking at the ESCO stands, do you need the BMW jack pad adapter with the ESCO's or can you drop the car onto the rubber pads at the jack points?Thanks\n\nQuickJack Lift + Esco Jack stands for 100% convenience, future proofing and safety is what you need, youll thank me later (and yes it works in lowered cars, Im on Bilsteins). With the QJ, I have all the space I would ever need underneath, oil changes, exhaust work, suspension changes, rims or brakes jobs are a breeze.Esco jack stands are great, but I would still use the BMW jack adapter pads.

It still wont fit all the way under without first jacking up the sides to put a small piece of wood under each tire in the front, but that takes all of 60 seconds.\n\nAny low profile jack will work if you use the right strategy.For lifting the front, I'll jack up one side using the REAR jack pad on either side, then place a jack stand on the front pad on that side.  That gives clearance to move the jack to the center jack point under the engine, which you can then place a jack stand on the opposite side and the front is secured.For the rear, I use the black cross bar (part of sub frame) behind the rear diff.  That will get you high enough to place jack stands on the rear lift pads.I would recommend the Esco stands, LOW PROFILE version.  And at least 2 BMW pad adapters.\n\nI actually just purchased a 2-ton Daytona aluminum floor Jack from harbor freight and two jackstands from rennstands. https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?store-page=Rennstand-Each-1-Piece-p252276669IMO its a really good way to lift the car using the existing plastic jack points.

Heck, if you want to wait a few minutes, the dealer will top it off for free.You can also order it from Amazon - if you have Prime, you'll get it by Friday.\n\nThe Manual says BMW Longlife-01 FE, and 0W30.  Since its hard to find Motul Oil, I'd go with a Mobil 1 or Castrol Edge 0W30, or just go to the BMW dealer.  And while you are there ask which brand they use when they do oil changes.\n\nThe dealers use to use Shell.  I understand that they have switched back to Castrol.

To my knowledge Bootmod3 currently only works off a wired connection.The downside is that it's a wired connection, so a little more \"hassle\" when it comes to coding / flashing the vehicle, but it allows you to do the flashing / coding significantly faster and will work on almost all the available apps and tuning platforms available. The MHD adapter is just as fast when it comes to the wired setup, however it's a pricey module. The upside to this setup is that it offers the same advantage of the MHD wireless adapter, but at a cheaper price point.Either way you can't go wrong! Just providing another alternative.\n\nI have both the enet cable and setups for the E series BMW and F series. But if you just want to clear codes and run scans, nothing beats the convenience of an ELM adapter and Torque Pro from the app store. Used it on all my BMWs without issue. Most important it provides accurate and specific code description. Personally I haven't had an issue with speed or latency.https://www.amazon.com/Veepeak"

    "text": "Hey guys,I just got a used 2021 BMW M2C with about 16k miles from the BMW dealership and the service intervals seemed to have been reset, so now everything is showing an arbitrarily long time before it needs to be serviced again.For example,* Brake fluid doesn't need to be serviced until 06/2024* Vehicle check not needed until 12/2026 or 40k miles* Front brake pads do not need to be replaced until another 60k miles. I know the brake pads have not been replaced since first owner, so the mileage doesn't seem realisticAny pointers would be helpful, thank you!\n\nThese checks and services have been done by the dealership (for instance, they have serviced/changed the brake fluid, so it now shows the 2-year period to the next service interval).Im sure the BMW dealership will provide the service history if you request a print out.Sounds like they have serviced all outstanding items.  Is the car CPO?  If so, they may have changed brake pads, etc.  its a rigorous program.Good luck and enjoy the car!\n\nBrake fluid due at 3 years from build date so that's normal. Front pads 60k miles is totally believable if 1st owner babied the car. The \"check\" probably was reset, I suspect that they did the \"free\" spark plug replacement that's covered in the initial 3/36 free service and reset that one.\n\nI bought it from a BMW dealership and the car only had one previous owner. It is not CPO.I'll call and see if they have the service history so I can look into details.Thank you!\n\nJust to add some context for the brake pad wear, I have a 2021 with over 20k miles and my front still show 60k life left. The rear show even longer at 80k!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFred Con"

Its now showing battery drain on the dash, I was just going to pop into the dealer but they want £150 just to look at it.... any ideas to check before blowing £150 in cash ? any views on battery life ?Let me try to help you.1) When you replaced the battery, did you have it recoded? Because as the battery gets older the car progressively charges it less and less in accordance to the progressively declining capacity of the battery. This is how the smart charging system works, however when you replace the battery you must recode the car otherwise the car will think that the battery is old and will not charge it to its peak capacity. Thus you will under charge the new battery and cause issues.2) Do you have any accessories like dash cameras or anything like that plugged into the car? That could cause battery drain over time. Especially things plugged into the obd2 port or into the fuse box or battery directly, because these things may not turn off when the car is off.3) Do you have any abilities to scan the car? There are cheap apps out there like bimmer link that allow you to have a very good diagnostic scanning, and the app is cheap so it really is a nice little tool to have for any bmw owner"

If the dealer installed the battery it should have been coded correctly, so no worries there.2. Interesting so there is nothing to potentially cause drain there. I don't have anything off the top of my head that would explain your situation, so you'll likely need to scan the car for codes.3.https://www.bimmerlink.app/This is the link, you will need a wireless obd2 adapter though (you can get something cheap like the vgate icar bluetooth adapters), but this will let you scan the car for any error codes.

I asked my SA about it, and he told me it is BMW policy to change plugs every third oil change, at least on these engines.  As long as BMW was paying for it, I had no problem letting them.

If my dealership tries any such nonsense, I'll be complaining to BMW corporate.My spark plugs were changes after three years.  That technically was during the fourth oil change.  After the breakin oil change my oil has been changed once a year due to oil age not mileage (under 10K miles per year).\n\nKevinC- It would have made more sense if I was on my third annual service as similar todavidkand DanG I don't hit 10k miles before annual service is due.

I certainly echo davidk's sentiments in that I would not be replacing spark plugs at such low mileage on my own dime.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's your first service or your 20th - plugs don't care about time, they care about how many times they're fired, i.e. MILEAGE. These stealerships are just grabbing money when BMW allows it. Shameful.

Crossing the ColoradoRockies, Utah, Nevada, Palm Springs California, then back thru Sedona, Taos New Mexico, Dodge City and back to Lincoln, NE. Not knowing what the gas situation will be like, and having been forced to use 89 octane because there was no 91 octane available, I am looking to bring along some Octane Booster should I run into this issue.  Colorado, and all the states with higher elevations, are notorious for not having anything above 87 or 89 octane.  I can tell you, this car does not like lower octane fuels.  Since I will be on the interstate and back roads cruising at hiway speeds for 3k or more miles, I want to ensure I have proper octane.  Lots of mountain driving means more engine loading climbing hills etc. and I want to avoid detonation.I searched this forum and did not find any information in regards to anyone using a booster additive as I describe.  Looking for recommendations on a trusted brand that I can keep in the trunk for the trip.Picture for attention only.\n\nBuy 20 liters of VP Q16 fuel and mix it.\n\nI've used boostane and logged it's results and it boosted the octane really well and reduced timing corrections on 91ACN which is pretty poor fuel.

    "text": "Yup, you read that right.Took the M2C into the dealer for scheduled maintenance today, and the dealership damaged it significantly. I drive a 2020 M2C, with less than 10k miles on the odometer, I've had it in my ownership for less than 2k miles (actually purchased the car from another forum member). The car was scheduled for brake fluid, oil change, spark plugs, and cabin filter. I also asked them to take a look at the rear taillight as I was receiving intermittent alerts saying there was a taillight malfunction.Not sure why it took them 4-5 hours (I had an appointment at 9:30am) to do a fluid change amongst other things, that should be fairly quick/simple, but they finally got back to me around 2:30 PM and informed me that my car was damaged. Their excuse was that the \"tech was avoiding a car that was swerving into him, and so he tried to avoid it and instead hit the curb\". I really wish I had a dashcam because I don't buy any of it.So far, the damage looks to be the front bumper, front lip, and both passenger side wheels. Pics below. This literally happened today (a mere few hours ago) and I am absolutely livid, speechless, and sick to my stomach. There really is no excuse for that car to have gone off the lot for a few fluid changes. I tried to get the exact location of where it happened, but the service director could only point me to the general area. I decided to walk up to the area (about 3-4 blocks away) and noticed quite a bit of skid marks on the road - though I can't be certain that was from my car or not. Sadly, I have no proof that their story pans out, but I firmly believe the tech took it out for a joy ride.The service director apologized and stated that they would"

Sadly, I have no proof that their story pans out, but I firmly believe the tech took it out for a joy ride.The service director apologized and stated that they would obviously repair the damage. I told him that this is obviously going to hurt the resale value, etc., and they replied that they can do everything in-house and no need to get insurance involved. I haven't decided which course of action I will take yet, but I will at least email them here shortly to ensure I'm documenting everything (e.g. - making sure they are admitting fault, etc.).Would love everyone's recommendations on how to proceed forward with this.. I'm so angry at the moment.Not sure if I need to get a lawyer involved. I want them to repair the damage + more for all of the troubles. Not only do I want them to fix everything that they damaged (including alignment), I want them to upgrade me to 763m wheels, replacement of my aftermarket carbon lip and side skirts to OEM carbon parts, new tires, and reimbursement for cost of PPF on the front bumper and lip.I was scheduled to take this car out to the track next month and was really looking forward to it.. but looks like that will have to wait.Pics below:\n\nSickening. Honestly, Id ask for brand new wheels, bumper, splitter, have the tires checked out to make sure theyre ok and ask for lifetime alignments. If theres any chassis damage, youll know pretty soon.Guaranteed it was a joy ride mishap not a typical evading a lane drifter event, in my opinion.

You definitely have every right to be.For what it's worth I just did that same service on my 2020 with 16k and I do have a dashcam. The tech drove it, I assume to make sure plugs were running correctly. He didn't get on it hard or anything though.Hell I'd make them foot the bill for a dashcam install 😂\n\nEven if an insurance claim is not filed, the shop may automatically report the incident/repair to Carfax. Which, to be honest, is only right. The next buyer ought to know that this happened.It sucks. Maybe the dealership is willing to guarantee value - ie well honor excellent quality KBB for trade in. Youd need that in writing, I suppose.Ive had situations where the shop caused minor damage that they repaired and I traded in shortly afterwards and the dealership gave me a big discount on my next purchase along with KBB for trade. Something to think about. Id figure out someway to offset the diminished value on the car.\n\nIt honestly looks more to me like what might happen if you're fucking around on your phone and veer into the curb accidentally."

Few days ago i allready bought an oil for another car, but now i dont need it.Try to check if this oil is suitable for the M2 gearbox but i only found the origine Part number for oil, no specifications. I bought this oil:https://www.ravenol.de/de/produkt/ge...vsg-sae-75w-90Ravenol VSG 75W90 SAEIs it Ok or need i another oil?Best regards Christian\n\nI think the original gearbox oil is GL-4 rated and 75W80 weight. So, no.Why do you need to change it?\n\nI do this with all my cars. BMW says its a lifetime fill. When the gearbox is broken, lifetime is over.Oil manufactors like castrol give their sealed products a best before time around five years. Every oil aiging, even when it is used, the additives wear also. The oil in my M2 is know five years old and around 50tkm in use. So its a good time to change it, also the diff again. Next change again five years or at 100tkm.The best example.for a very fast wear of additives: My daily Bimmer E90 has a very sticky gearbox. Often first gear wont step in in first try. Changes the oil, it was a bitt better. Then fill in two portion of Liqui Moly gearbox additive. It was amazing, the first time it was like having a brand new gearbox and was very happy. But lasts only 500km (city traffic), then slowly start to get sticky again.So, i guess its a good idea to change it time to time.\n\nCheck your clutch hydraulics.

Clutch is fine, its really the gearbox.F87sourceThanks, will take a look to this oil.\n\nAs you can see I've had 3 M2's, and always have used the factory spec'd oil by Pentosin:https://www.bimmerworld.com/Fluids/D...uid-Liter.html\n\nI just go to the Redline oils site and use what they suggest.\n\nThat very interesting.

It is also extremely good oil with a solid base stock, and fantastic additive package.I wouldn't use bmw 0w30 because it is an LL01-FE oil, which is meant for fuel economy and thus is thinner to reduce parasitic drag.

    "text": "the taillight.  It took them all day to fix it through.Since it is a new part I now have a two year warranty on the right taillight.They didn't try to fix mine at all, they just replaced it.\n\nThere is a huge long thread about this on the technical forum.I had my passenger taillight begin to throw errors about a year ago. I took it to the dealer and they tried to pretend that they couldn't see any errors and that it was probably a one time thing. I had to wait for it to go off again and then immediately drove to the dealership without touching my turn signal (*cue BMW driver jokes*). They ended up replacing the entire taillight under warranty. Hasn't had an issue since.However, now my driver side taillight recently started giving me occasional errors. My warranty expires in March so I'll have to figure out how to convince the dealer to fix it before then.In the technical thread, there have been a lot of discussions about root causes for people who don't want to spend $700 replacing a taillight out of warranty. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone has definitely identified the issue. As already mentioned, some folks found removing, cleaning, and replacing helped, while others have not had such luck. Someone figured out that disabling bulb monitoring with bimmercode prevents the errors, but at least one person has also caught their car on fire doing that, so I wouldn't recommend that.It's a weird issue.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJustAWhisperThere"

So MSP/A if you can get it - I believe Europe still uses MSP/A (I think Canada is switching to SAF-XJ now), or SAF-XJ (remember it has to be exactly SAF - XJ, not SAF - XJ + FM as the FM is additional friciton modifiers and meant for the E9x m3 and will blow your F8x E diff).The reason why I didn't buy Castrol syntrax limited slip gear oil was because it is also compatible with the E9X m3 which requires more friction modifiers to stay quiet and operate optimally.

Is it possible to fit it in the trunk to bring to the track (5k model) and has anyone tried the 12v option.That's one of the reasons I got the 12V DC power supply, but the 7000lb version seems simply too heavy at 2 frames x 100lb + 1 pump x 30-40lb. Maybe the 5000lb one is light enough? Either way, the frames are fairly long (about a foot short of touching the tires when placed under the car) and might be awkward to get out of the car without scuffing the protector or bumper by yourself--may be a lot more manageable with 2 people. It does work great on a portable car jump starter or the car battery itself, though--tested it both ways.\n\nYeah, I don't think you'd be able to travel to the track with wheels and QuickJack's in the M2. You'd have to have the seats folded down to get the frames in and then fitting wheels around would probably be challenging (especially to also secure them safely so wheels or jacks don't move while driving).If you were trailing the vehicle then they'd be super convenient.

I was debating changing my manual trans. fluid too but I didn't see any data supporting a change one way or the other - Blackstone didn't have enough data either to tell me whether it was necessary.At any rate, the filling capacity is 1.6 Liters. Note that the instructions say to fill until overflowing, which in my experience is typical for a manual transmission fluid change:https://www.newtis.info/tisv2/a/en/f...box/1VnXyO2l8u\n\nI thought the fluid got changed as part of the RIS?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyI thought the fluid got changed as part of the RIS?Nope, transmission fluid is not changed as part of the run in service.\n\nWell, How long are you planning to keep this car for? If you're going to replace it before the end of the Warranty period, you may as well leave it alone.Back in the days of BMW not filling the transmission with LTF-1 or LTF-2 and changing the customer for oil changes, they used to say do it every 2 years.For reference, I replaced the LTF-1 in the gearbox of my e46 330ci at 150k miles. It was as black as soot and had the consistency of milk. Noting that the stuff going in looked like apple juice, the question with the LTF is more what counts as the \"Life\" that these gearboxes are \"Filled For\"?HTH\n\nI changed my 6MT at the running in service.

Cheap insurance.  Capacity is around 1L I believe, but I'd check an actual service manual to determine exactly.  Or do the old fashioned way and use your pinky.\n\nThe recommendation for an early MT oil change is from Mike Miller of BMW CCA fame. After that it's every 30k miles. Just like the engine, a low mileage change can remove any manufacturing debris or any odd bits that are generated in the first few miles of use. Makes sense to me, anyway.Sure, if you'll only keep the car for a short time it won't make any difference, assuming the right amount of oil was put in there to start with. Probably a good bet that everything's fine but it's a simple service and provides peace of mind.\n\njust curious I track the car about 15-20 days a year. Does the transmission fluid need to change on the MT sooner? Shifts feel fine always rev match on shift and never engine brake\n\nI changed mine at 1200 miles and will do it again at 30k if I have the car still.The factory fluid by Pentosin, buy 2 of them, takes about 1.6 liters:https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw...ntosin-1052107"

There is one exception though, BMW's old shell made LL01 TPT 5w30 was amazing oil to the point where you were on the level of aftermarket oil.

I was under the impression that it was a direct injection and PCV system issue both of which still apply to the N55.  Actually the M2 comes with 0W-30 weight whereas the N54 came with 5W-30 oil with the likelihood that the thinner oil sill have a slighter higher propensity to end up recirculating into the intake and mucking up the intakes over time.I know Ford has added Port injection to their V8 motor to reduce this issue (it is now both port and direct injection) but not aware of anything that BMW did on the N55 motors.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_c...&v=xrLNDgrIw3UI don't believe they they added port injection, oil separator or anything like that to significantly reduce this?Can you please elaborate how the N55 generation of direct injected motors will no longer muck up the valves"

I would assume that this would also be applicable to the extended warranty.Coming from the BMW corporate world, this also make sense, as the warranty programs between Canada and the US are different, so it would only make sense for the company to offer warranty repairs in the country that the vehicle was sold in.

One of the questions was, whether the error gets stored and based on the dealership info on the invoice it does (and counts the amount of it having happened). It took me several times to capture the error message, as it sometimes went away quickly. So, for those who encounter the issue, the dealership should see it.Outcome was the same as for most, tail light assembly got replaced. The fact that it was in stock at the dealership suggests it is indeed a common issue.\n\nMine was definitely stored.  They redid the wiring harness about a year ago.  I haven’t had a problem since.\n\nYup had to do both of mine, at different times. Had a quick popup the other day after a big storm but it went away right after.\n\nI am reviving this because I have had a left rear turn signal malfunction for a bit over a year (usually lasts less than a minute before it clears itself) now on my 2018 M2.  I had the dealer look at it when it was still under warranty, but they were \"unable to duplicate\" (even though they were able to see the code, as well as my pictures of the error), and sent me on my way hoping it wouldn't return.  Is there any one cause for this error?  Since it clears itself fairly quickly, I haven't been too concerned, but it is beginning to irritate me.\n\nGuess you found out why BMW Northwest is not the best service dealer in our area.  BMW has service bulletins out on this problem.  They were suppose to check the wiring harness first.

By the way I had over 100 right taillight malfunctions that they could read.\n\nIf the dealer is brushing you off you just need to be persistent. The dealers should know by now that it's a common issue. Many are replacing lights immediately without fuss (mine sent me away the first time it happened, but replaced it when I came back a second time with the light actively on, and they replaced the 2nd taillight immediately without question when the issue appeared there too). Maybe BMWNA is starting to get annoyed and your dealer is trying to wait out your warranty to make their lives easier, but that's purely speculative.Either way, you just need keep bugging your dealer until they fix it. The issue will get progressively worse.EDIT: Saw the poster brought up the software fix. You can do that, but it means other faults might be masked as well. Users have reported their taillights malfunctioning with no indications because they used the software change. I would definitely try to get the issue fixed by the dealer if you still have a warranty."

It could be anything from a loose gas cap to a misfire.  Take it to the dealership or at the very least scan it yourself and find out what the fault code is.\n\nSpoke to service rep. He said keep driving until it feels unusual.

At least check that first.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPrudhvionlineSpoke to service rep. He said keep driving until it feels unusual.

I picked up my '18 LCI Oct. 12, have ~300 miles on the car now. I gave her a bath on saturday, started her up and got a CEL. Still hasn't gone away, checked gas cap, and car runs fine. Called service, but they haven't gotten back to me yet. Autozone couldn't pull the code, since the car isn't in their system.\n\nI got a light that cleared after a day. It was a misfire on one of the cylinders. Car went into a truly ugly limp mode. It cleared up next time I fired it up. I took it to the dealer and their book said clear code, drive for 10 miles and if it doesn't reoccur, give car back to customer.I had a P304 that I was able to read with my phone.http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1416662\n\nI already had the break in service done at 1270 miles. Now the car has around 2300 miles and the CEL cam on again. Last time it was gone in couple of days. Its been two days now. I have a long drive this weekend. Is it worth taking the risk to drive on.\n\nYou should pickup a code reader. Better yet, get the one compatible with BimmerCode so you can also code if you like plus read/clear CEL."

What is considered a \"safe\" interval depends on whether you're keeping the car short or long term.You hear a lot about walnut/dry ice blasting, installing oil catch cans and generally questioning whether the service intervals are just for what BMW considers the lifetime of the car - warranty end period. There is a reason for that based on people's experience with not only BMW, but all manufacturers.I can't answer whether its safe to just take it in when it alerts you - it depends.Do you want to keep the car around only during the warranty and maintenance period? If so, then yes it is perfectly safe to do so.If you plan to keep the car for the long run, then no, it is not in your best interest to follow a 10k+ km interval for oil changes or believing the transmission fluid is \"lifetime fluid\".Toyota follows a 5,000 km/6 month oil change interval for Land Cruisers in the Middle East. I do 7,500 km/6 months, so even I am not as stringent as they are. Albeit, I considered that their interval is inclusive of people actually taking their LCs off-road, so I have some leeway.Since you have a maintenance package, you can do interim oil changes at an indie and request they don't reset the CBS.

    "text": "Hey all. I recently coded out ASD using Bimmercode and started noticing a very high pitched electrical noise in the cabin. The noise is not too loud, but definitely can be heard over an idling engine. It's a high pitched noise that you'd normally get from electronics power adapters. Like current flowing through or something.I tried to trace where it's coming from. I'm roughly guessing it's either the center speaker, the center screen, or the gauge cluster, but I can't pinpoint the exact location.I get this noise with the engine on or off. I tried rebooting the iDrive system but the sound is still there even during the reboot. Fwiw I don't think coding out ASD caused the problem - it just let me hear it more clearly.Does anyone have the same issue? Or know how to solve it?\n\nWeird. I too have coded out ASD with Bimmercode, no such issue. Is it possible there's another electronic device there someplace causing this - like a dealer lot tracker left in the car? It's obviously not in the OBD port or you'd have already stumbled on it.\n\nI would pull the fuse on the amp and see if the noise goes away.  Sounds like an amp problem to me.\n\nStart with some basic troubleshooting. Reenable ASD and see if the issue goes away. If it does you're on the right track. If not then it might be something else that was coded or some other coding potentially conflicting with the ASD disable. In that case I would reverse every change back to stock and see if it goes away. If it does work your way back up one change at until you find the culprit.

Here are the experiments I did so far:1. turn off the center screen - doesn't help2. turn down interior light (both through the dial left to the steering column, and also through \"Vehicle Settings\") - doesn't help3. restore ASD through Bimmercode - doesn't help4. Pull fuse 121 - noise goes away! (see pics for the exact fuse I pulled)Of course after pulling the fuse the center screen stops working, and the speakers as well. At least I didn't hear the \"gong\" at start up.At this point I'm suspecting the noise is coming from the speakers. I listened very closely by literally glueing my ear to all the speakers, and I'm quite certain that the noise is coming from the speakers mounted on the door inside of the side mirror. (Not sure what the technical name is for the speaker, but it's the one on the door, the upper one, with \"Harman Kardon\" on it).

Even if I coded back the ASD I still get the noise (albeit slightly different frequency). I googled it more and found some posts on X3 forums about this issue, that's when I suspected ASD. I installed a TechnicPNP harness and the noise is fully gone. Of course there's still tube rush in the tweeter (like any other audio system), but it's very minimal and within normal range, and the tone itself is not annoying anymore.I don't care about fake engine noise either way, but one great benefit of installing the harness is the audio quality is now much much better. The resolution is much better than before, and now finally it sounds like a decent \"premium\" audio system. I don't have to crank up the volume to hear all details, bass is clear and well defined, treble is now precise.\n\nThis is some great information for what seems like a very isolated issue. Thanks for your follow-up!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byhotpxlReporting back, TLDR is I resolved the issue with ASD harness.It turns out that ASD was the problem after all.

    "text": "A member in a local car group turned me onto theAGA Tools Jack Roda couple weeks ago, and I immediately knew I wanted to get one for the convenience it added to securing my floor jack.When I'm at the track or just want to do something under one side of the car quickly at home I typically just jack up one side of the car using my floor jack, and place a jack stand under the other side jack point that my jack isn't under in order to swap wheels/brake pads/ect. With the AGA Jack Rod, I can simply pop it into place on my floor jack, and have no more need to place an additional jack stand under the car making things faster and more convenient.Quote:Originally Posted byIndex0:00 Intro0:13 Why we use jack stands0:48 How the Jack Rod works1:50 Floor jack compatibility4:50 Making the top cup more narrow5:49 Jack rod disassembly and inspection13:03 Jack rod use with car14:23 Conclusion\n\nReally neat tool! Kind of expensive for what it is, but really neat! I do wish it had more height adjustment range though.\n\nThat looks interesting. I use my QuickJack, I'm fairly trusting of the locking mechanism on those but will occasionally use jack stands too if I'll be spending time actually under the vehicle while raised.This price looks perhaps slightly better than that other jack stand option which I've seen recommended a bunch of times with the jack-pad type thing which then has legs you can slide in after lifting the car to put a jack stand under the same point as you used to lift the car. I liked that concept too but think it was also $200+ which just seems extreme when I'd rather just go with using a traditional jack stand for the money savings. The extra convenience seems difficult to justify the extra expense, this at least looks more reasonable."

The spark plug replacement assumes only the factory counted oil changes (excluding the 1200 mile break in) at 1 year or 10k miles. Your plugs were definitely changed too early which isn't really a big deal since that is covered up to 30k under the free maintenance. I would take advantage of their error though and try to get another set before free maintenance runs out at 30k lol.\n\nAt my last free service"

In fact early BMWs under the free maint did not even include the 1 year oil changes.

The coolant temp was up to temperature pretty quickly, between 5 and10 minutes.  It went to 217, then dropped to 195, and stayed in the 200-210 range for the rest of the drive.  When I arrived at my destination the gauge was showing 205.  The fan was not running after shutting off the car.I checked to see if there were any stored codes and there were none.The car sat for 2.5 hours during my visit.  The ride home was 2 miles and took 5 minutes.  I had disconnected the OBDII adapter, so not sure what the temperature was.  When I shut the car off in the garage, the fan was still running.

I point out to him that my tires are nowhere near the wear indicator and then he proceeds to give me some BS response.  I told him Im no spring chicken when it comes to tires/automotive repair and the tires look fine. He continues to push for new tires and an alignment and I just say no 3 or 4 more times.

I don't know if it is worth my time and effort.\n\nYou could try calling the GM. Who knows they might comp you something. It could be that the techs and SA are running a side show and either keeping the tires for themselves or even worse, selling them on the used market.

Generally winter storage for around 6 months is really getting to pushing a tire's ability to rebound from flat spotting - so people generally rotate the tires to avoid it sitting on one patch of rubber for too long, so 2 years would way too long to let a tire just sit. So imo for a 2 year storage flat stoppers are a must.2) Suspension - imo it is better to leave a car resting on its suspension, having a car on jack stands and having the strut being stretched out likely isn't good for it since it was designed to"

Having it stretched out can induce corrosion on the shaft if in a really humid environment - although this is really unlikely.3) No brake pressure, because this can cause the pads to sieze to the rotors, also having the rubber brake lines to be cosntantly under pressure is not a good thing. As long as your calipers are properly bled you will be fine.4) No real need for a dehumidifier in the interior so long as it is not in a super humid environment.5) Otherwise fresh fluids in a standard oil service, battery tender, close all vents and plug the exhaust, cover the car and you should be good.Also put plenty of pest repellent around the car incase you have rodents in your area because they can eat wiring harnesses.\n\nThank you both, very good info.

VP  C9 or similar.VP C9 is $80 per 5 gallons iirc, you need 52L to fill up the tank so 15 gallons is needed as they sell in multiples of 5 gallons. This means you need 3 barrels at $80 a barrel you would pay $240 to fill up the car. and regardless of fuel type, in 2 years you will have oxidation in the fuel rendering it garbage.This is not a cost effective solution at all, if your goal is to keep the fuel system saturated and prevent moisture from entering the loop and causing issues. Fuel stabilizer + pump gas is the best option. Then in 2 years you can just drain the tank and pump in fresh fuel for a fraction of the cost.\n\nI don't believe VP will oxidize in 2 years, but that's just what VP has told me.  Pump gas will turn to varnish no matter how much stabilizer you add over that timeframe.  We spend $240 for one tire on these cars...  I'd call $240 on storage fuel money well spent.

Would I contact BMW USA directly or go through the dealer?Had an indy shop price the job at $650 that includes dropping the diff, new seals, and diff fluid service. Alignment is extra (but required). Not too bad but if I can BMW to cover it (seems like a common issue) I'd rather go that route."

    "text": "Fully stock, unmodded car.  I had a money shift earlier this year that resulted in a full engine replacement by the dealer.  Since the replacement, I have had a CEL for the cat -which the dealer is telling me will require a cat replacement to fix.  I decided to get an second opinion at a local independent shop, where the following two error codes were logged:180001 - Catalytic converter: efficiency below limit value (intermittent), and120308 - Charging pressure control, plausibility Pressure too low (intermittent)The local shop visually checked and found nothing wrong, but found that the car had an older integration, so updated it and cleared the codes (while charging me nearly $400...(secondary question, was I gouged?)).  Two days later and the CEL for the cat has popped up again.Having just moved across country, I sadly do not have the necessary tools to properly investigate this myself, so I am at the mercy of using the dealer or local shop to diagnose/fix this.  That said, I am humbly asking for any advice as to the cause and solution to what could be wrong before I dump more money into testing/replacing stuff.1.  Assuming the cat is damaged, would continuing to drive the car cause damage to the turbo (as indicated by the 120308 code)?2.  What is the most reliable/accurate way to diagnose what the actual problem is with the car?  IE, could one of these faults be causing the other?3.  With limited tools, what can I do myself to diagnose this problem?  I have done a visual inspection as best I can and saw nothing obvious.Any help is appreciated!"

I've seen here and there on the forums that if you are going to leave one of these cars for any long period of time, that it is a good idea to leave a battery tender on it to keep the battery health.I've read that the battery in these cars are crazy expensive, and if I use the wrong charger it can destroy the battery, and they are something like $1200 to replace.

It must have the ability to maintain the charge, not just charge continuously.  Also, must have the ability to charge AGM type batteries.Here is a solid recommendation for a \"smart\" battery charger.CTEK (56-864) MUS4.3 12 Volt Fully Automatic 8 Step Battery ChargerSo, this will get you in the right direction.

If you just change out a dead battery for a new one, but don't \"reset\" this table of learned charging factors, you end up killing the new battery much more quickly since the car ends up overvolting it (new battery doesn't need as much voltage to charge as the old one did).The CTek chargers are solid, as are the actual \"Battery Tender\" brand.

Although unnecessary: if it can't hurt, then might as well right?Hurt no, but possibly cause a rough idle due to incomplete combustion maybe. But the good thing is that these cars aren't super sensitive to plug heat ranges from what I see (they're more gap sensitive). So if you must you can get colder plugs just keep stock gap and don't just gap to 0.020\", gap down sparingly and only if needed (stock gap should be absolutely fine even on stage 2+ maps, but if it's not go down in small incriments).Although keep in mind I think it's a huge waste of money to go with a colder plug for no reason because ngks are $20/plug and the oem Bosch plugs are $6/plug. So over 3x more for no gains or benefits at all (untill you're making significant power).\n\nRunning a colder plug without the added heat from more power will just foul the plugs faster. No difference in performance though.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceQuote:Originally Posted byHunterHofmanThanks for your reply.

It is now just going by the age of the oil.2) Unless all your drives are under 30min long you do not need to worry about water in the oil. The oil gets to 120c in normal conditions, enough to evaporate all of the water in the oil.If you get Mayo you have a bigger issue or have been only driving short journeys. A long drive will sort this.3) Oil health and miles are related but not the be all connection. 5000km on track will have a different oil wear to 5000km doing 100kmh on the highway. The reason Americans change their oil more often is (in my opinion) partly cultural (quick lube propaganda) and because of their shit fuel with more sulfur that will acidity the oil sooner than say EU fuel.I would change the oil, it's cheap to do and ensures it's good. This is a high performance turbo car, it needs good oil to live a long life.If you don't track I would follow what the car says. If you do track then change it more often. The only way to know for certain you have the \"right\" interval is to have the oil tested.Not big in the EU (for cars, boats it's more common) but there are some companies popping up to do it.\n\n5,000km is just just over 3,100 miles.Noting that some parts of BMW Europe mandate 2 year intervals for oil service, It may be that you can safely leave"

Also there is a bunch of squishy rubber in the suspension.

The setup does not need to be perfect as it's constantly changing (also changes as the suspension compresses).I would do it at BMW or the best alignment place near you. Don't take it to the cheapest mofo out there as you can easily screw up the lower rear suspension arms.

They definitely felt like small pieces of plastic when I removed them.\n\nWell, plastic is unlikely to be more than additional carbon deposits in the combustion chamber. The question is more where did said plastic fragments come from?\n\nThat’s what I’m curious about.  Is it possible they may have come from a broken charge pipe?

But SAF-XJ should still suffice.The only weird thing is that the US is the only country that I know of, where bmw still uses SAF-XJ. Even in Canada where we normally import most car parts from the US, we have the made in Germany (German bottle that you would get globally) MSP/A diff oil. Same goes for transmission oil, and brake fluid - Canada and the rest of the world to the best of my knowledge gets the German made and German domestic market bottles. The US gets their rebranded for the US market stuff, which sometimes is made in Germany like the brake fluid, but sometimes made in the US. I'm not sure why this is the case. But so long as you get either msp/a (preferred) or saf-xj you should be fine. The other options two below will likely cause issues.SAF-X"

Good call regarding the lubing up, simply forgot about that. Regarding the torque wrench, I was aware of that, however I didn't have access to my own tools since I was in a shop with a 4-post car lift. I usually never use my torque wrench as a breaker bar, but thanks for the headsup.Finally, that car has had its differential oil flushed at the run-in service (1200 miles) in December 2018 and the car now has almost done 10,000 miles. The car has also never seen a track.

So imo if you want the car to last I would do every 4 years or ~40,000 km whatever comes first (essentially half of bmw's recommended range).Me personally I do it every 4 years because I don't drive enough to hit the mileage requirements.I don't have a dct so I have no clue about range and intervals as I didn't look it up. But I would also do it every 4 years or 40,000 km just like the diff (I use the same intervals for my 6mt). I also believe the dct has a filter which you may need to change as well."

The local dealership replaced it and everything seemed fine until I went on a trip outside the country and realized everything was extremely bright at night, especially roadsigns. It almost looked like I had high beams on all the time. People coming towards me started turning on their high beams, etc. It was a nightmare to drive at night.I figured it had to be levelling issue, so I went to a BMW dealership in Frankfurt and they adjusted the headlights, and told me now everything is fine. Sure enough, the headlights were aiming lower, but they're still WAY TOO STRONG. The road signs are still extremely bright, and turning on the high beams lights up everything like it's day. So I parked the car in the garage and turned on the regular lights - they were difficult to look at from about 15 meters away, and to me they really did seem way too strong, both left and right headlight.What could the dealership have possibly done while replacing the headlight to make such a mess? Is it possible they had to \"reset the settings\" or something and the settings defaulted to pre-LCI lights, so now LEDs are getting to much curent / voltage?In any case, I'm going to another dealership tomorrow morning (currently in Berlin - oh what a joy it is to travel with a \"broken\" car), and I'll see what they have to say, but I'm interested to hear what people here think it could be.\n\nI hope you figure this out, as I'd like to mess up my car that way"

I bought the 2021 M2C from Rallye BMW 125 miles away in Long Island NY.  I liked that dealership as well, but it is too far to go for service.This week the M2C was due for the 1200 mile run-in service.  I made an appointment with the dealership in North Haven and drove an hour to bring it in and waited while the service was done.  Everything was great as expected - oil, filter, and rear axle fluid all changed and the run-in service reminder cleared.  As well as a white glove treatment with plastic covers on the seat and steering wheel and a paper floor mat when I got back in the car.There is a BMW dealership 7 miles from me that's a 10 minute drive.  I have a couple BMW friends, including an M2C owner, who take their cars to this dealership and are satisfied with the service there.  I considered it as well, but in the end I chose the dealership an hour away because of my familiarity and trust with them.  Secondly, the dealership in North Haven is an M Certified Center, while the dealership close by is not.Is it being too OCD to only trust an M Certified Center with an M car?This is the dealership I went with for service.https://www.bmwofnorthhaven.com/m-certified-center/\n\nFrom what I understand, this is more of a sales focused program. The CAs go to SC for some driving and extra training on the M products and the dealership puts out a dedicated display. I don’t think it affects service much from what I’ve read. Especially not routine service. I’d feel comfortable getting fluid changes etc. anywhere.\n\nAgree with Chris above."

So I suggest you call the dealership that you use for servicing and inquire about the recall. If it is legit they will tell you so and then at that point book and appointment and come in to get it fixed. Also make sure you ask about any fees - if it is a recall it will obviously be free and of course do not pay over the phone."

But I was comparing additive packages to see which one looked like it had a better package.Also thicker doesn't mean it's better, for instance since both have the same hths the thinner one could point at a more stout base stock because it is able to handle sheer better even though it's a thinner oil. Pour point would tell if higher grade base stock was used too if it is abjlw to flow at super low temps despite being a higher weight oil, like Mobil1 0w40 can flow even at iirc -50C or even lower, and it's true Mobil1 had alot of paos in it.\n\nZinc level is down probably to meet timing chain requirements by certain manufacturers.I wouldn't look too much into additives in VOA.

It is just personal preference but I always keep my cars extremely well maintained compared to the average or even enthusiast owner, so it is a small touch to keep everything running at 100%.Becareful when you are cleaning it that you don't drop the sensor, and don't touch the wires inside of it. Also when you are unclipping the MAF sensor use a small flat head to lift the connector gently so it doesn't break.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byHappy MotoringCurious how often people are cleaning their MAF sensors, if at all.I recently got the air mass too high code 102001 and some people were suggesting to clean the sensor.

Then that dirt will end up on the maf and cake the maf despite it's supposed self cleaning ability. You can't bake dirt off.I've seen some dusty mafs from bmws, I'd keep it clean before it gets so bad with dust getting suck in every crack you can clean it anymore.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byEnabledA dirty sensor will never read too high.

Only time Poland experience extreme temperatures might be in winter. In summer don't worry. Also, ambient temperature is not what overheats the car. It is altitude and Poland is pretty low.Someone suggested Pennzoil. Pennzoil is repackaged Shell. Shell owns Pennzoil and they bought brand not Pennzoil know-how as it wasn't on par Shell.In EU you can safely run LL04 and that oil is actually recommended. If you do track vehicle, LL01 would be better choice.My choice would be Motul 5W30 X-Clean + (+is very important). It is exceptional oil. That oil will be ok in summer or winter.If you are out of warranty, you don't have to use LL04 or LL01 oils."

It sounds as if the front suspension is clunking.Car is my DD and no track driving yet.Hm...If you have camber plates usually clunking noise is normal.If you hear the clunking sound at full wheel turn over bumps at slow speed, it will most likely be the upper strut/mount nut/bolt that is lose.As you never have touched any suspension no modification and considering the car is relatively new, I don't think it would be the strut/mount joint problem. However, try to make full turn (left or right see if they both or one side make sound) and go over a shallow bump at low (~5 mph) speed. If it does make clunky noise, then most likely it will be strut/mount joint.If you do not hear anything, things can get trickier. Then, it is not easy to diagnose the problem without actually conducting a close inspection.Try to listen more carefully to check where the noise is coming from (driver or passenger side), if you have a lifting jack, take off the wheel and check for a bad/loose tie rod and ball joint, checked torque on all suspension bolts, checked the shock for oil leakage etc. If you find everything looks find, it also could be swaybar link.Sorry mate that I cant help much but thats all I have to say...Best way is to take her to dealership (but as yours is flashed, you might feel not good to go see dealer directly, then best way is to take her to reputable mechanic around you).\n\nAppreciate the detailed response and help.

Will it really cause brake components to rust?\n\nBrake fluid does not care about mileage unless it's hard mileage (track use, or with trucks it would be towing), it makes no difference if you were driving tons of miles every year or driving 1000 miles per year. Brake fluid, because it is hydroscopic will absorb water over time so time is the only thing that matters other than extreme use.The actual brake fluid costs around $20, when I've had a shop change brake fluid I paid $100. Going over the 2 year interval is not going to rust your components in 2 years, so if you stretch the interval it will almost certainly have a negative impact on your brake system. It's unlikely that you'll see issues within 5-7 years if you extend the interval to 3 or 4 years but you likely will see issues past that and the cost to"

Great fluid and not too expensive.\n\nFor everyday street driving the fluid will not really make a difference, their feel will not really be different. The difference between fluids are in wet and dry boiling points and I suppose some differences in whether the fluids might react differently to the components in the brake system over time.I haven't really heard of there being significant differences between manufacturers, I would just recommend finding a decent fluid with a high dry boiling point (since with tracking we should be changing frequently enough to never approach the wet boiling point). You can consider cost, but I'd consider availability as probably the key criteria. You do not really want to be mixing fluid, so sticking to the same fluid is advisable to avoid needing to do very thorough flushes each time.Technically BMW call for DOT4 low viscosity,"

The safelite guy confirmed it too.\n\nI had my front windshield replaced at Safelite as well a few months ago, they had no issues with getting me the OEM glass.  Instead of choosing to have one of their mobile vans come over I decided to have the work done at one of their locations. Felt more comfortable having the work done their as oppose to at my apartment complex or work lol.\n\nThank you all reading your experiences have helped and I will go with BMW replacement windshield.\n\nHere's a tip for any windshield replacement on BMW.The A pillars inside the car have a wide gap so when they throw aftermarket adhesive on you will see the adhesive 90% of the time - they can't really predict how it lands because put it on in this kind of orientation /\\ and then it flattens out.Ask them to install a \"foam dam\" its a little piece black foam that will prevent the majority if not all of the black shiny adhesive to show in your car.  I went through this twice on two different cars and they had to re do the replacement.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySteelguinS"

Then I felt a thunk like my car had a hiccup and I had a sudden drop in power. So I slowed down and continued on the expressway. When I was off the expressway in stop and go traffic, I could feel the car wasn't running right. When I would press the accelerate pedal there was a significant lack of power and slow or hesitant acceleration. Also when shifting gears the acceleration was choppy. Sometimes power would kick in suddenly like it popped into gear.There were no check engine lights, no warnings on the dash or in idrive. Vehicle status in idrive is OK.I wasn't far, so I carefully drove it home like an old lady. When I got home I turned off the car, looked around, under, and in the engine bay and nothing visibly wrong. After a few minutes I turned the car back on and it was idling very rough. Still no warnings or lights.Due to the rough idling, I don't think it's transmission related. But I'm no mechanic, so not sure what it could be. Has anybody had an issue like this with their M2 or any ideas what it might be? Did a quick search on the forums, but could not find anything that matched my experience.My M2 is completely stock, purchased new in 2017. I only have 20,000 miles on it. It spends most of its time sitting in the garage. Never had any serious issue with my car. It's been bullet proof until now.I plan to call in the morning to get it looked at by a professional. But I'm kind of freaking out tonight worried about it. And of course my warranty ended about 2 months ago.\n\ncharge pipe?https://f87.bimmer"

I took a look and that is exactly what happened. Dammit I'm pissed and disappointed in BMW that they would use such a flawed part on a performance car. If this part is prone to failure you would think BMW should do a recall. I checked my VIN and there are no recalls on my car. It's like it was purposely designed to last just past the 4 year warranty period.I hope I didn't hurt my engine driving it home like that, about 10 miles?Oh well... Since it has to be replaced, I guess I might as well upgrade to an aftermarket metal charge pipe, instead of replacing with the plastic OEM. Looks like VRSF, Turner, and Active Autowerke make upgrades. I'll do some more research on these.Enjoy some pics of the damage.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFroggiI hope I didn't hurt my engine driving it home like that, about 10 miles?No.\n\nSucks but at least it's ok.

    "text": "Introduction:In this thread I will be reviewing the Fuel-it ethanol content tester. Before we begin I have to extend a shout out to Fuel-it for giving me a discount/reimbursement to review this tester, but like always I will be writing an unbiased review.Credit:All images in this review were taken by me.Disclaimer:Any technical advice, installation instruction, or product installation, product usage tips, any form of advice provided in this review, or decision to purchase a product is done so at your own risk I will not be responsible for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, any damage to your car, or any property damage.Shipping:First lets talk about shipping, since I know it may be scary to have a small glass test tube be sent in the mail - since these things can be fragile. Well for this fuel tester they wrapped it in bubble wrap and shipped it within a fedex cardboard envelope that also has bubble wrap in its interior. So the fuel tester was fairly well protected and arrived to me without issue. Shipping was also pretty fast taking about a week to get to me, and processing time took about a day which is also really fast.Overview:In this section we will be looking over a few critical areas of fuel testers and how fuel-it improved on their tester to make it surpass all other fuel testers on the market, and addressed any potential issues.Importance of using an ethanol tester:With the growing popularity of OTS tunes that utilize ethanol blends like BM3 and MHD, the need to know the exact content of ethanol you use to blend becomes ever so important. This is because if you use too much ethanol your fuel trims will go too far out of range which can cause tuning issues and your HPFP can even crash. If you do not have enough ethanol due to your E85 station dispensing low concentrations of ethanol, your octane ratings can be lower than required by"

    "text": "will go too far out of range which can cause tuning issues and your HPFP can even crash. If you do not have enough ethanol due to your E85 station dispensing low concentrations of ethanol, your octane ratings can be lower than required by your tune causing knock and potentially engine failure. So it is really important to know the percentage of ethanol that your E85 station is dispensing so an affordable tool like this is extremely important.Cap Material/construction:This is an extremely important aspect of ethanol fuel testers because they must be shaken to mix the ethanol and water. So if a cap is made of unsuitable materials it can cause a leak and that will cause the percentage reading to be off (literally every drop counts) and cause a mess.Standard ethanol testers:- Utilize a cheap plastic cap either with no seal or a silicone based rubber seal.- This brings in potential issues because if a seal is not used the coarse thread design of the cap and the design utilizing very few threads can result in a leak.- If a cheap rubber or silicone seal is used the gasoline and ethanol in the e85 can make the seal swell also resulting in a leak.- This is what generally occurs with cheap ethanol content testers on the market.Fuel-it ethanol tester:- Fuel-it used to use a cheap plastic cap like what was described above and reports did have it leaking. But like what is the norm with fuel-it they listen to customer reports and strive to improve their products. So they introduced a second generation of cap which is a thin tin cap with a foam like gasket. This is similar to what a vodka bottle cap would be like and the design is completely immune to the seal swelling effects from alcohol or gasoline, and thus this cap does not leak over time like cheaper caps do.- I have tested this cap with both E88 and pure 91 octane gasoline both left in the fuel tester for a few days (upside down so the fuel would contact the cap and"

Unlike other cheaper testers which have inked on markings, the fuel-it ethanol content tester is laser etched into the glass test tube. This means that the fuel-it tester will not be susceptible to the markings fading over time due to the solvent nature of ethanol and gasoline (which is really good at dissolving ink markings like those found on cheaper testers).Credit: F87sourceCredit:F87sourceSo above is an image of a lab/medical grade BD syringe which is one of the most high quality syringes you can buy, unlike those cheap dollar store/amazon syringes. This is what I use to suck some ethanol out of my fuel jug to add into the ethanol tester, and as you can see just with a few exposures to e85 the markings on the side of the syringe has been washed off. This is what will eventually happen to cheaper ethanol content testers with simple printed on markings the ethanol will dissolve those markings and"

    "text": "Hey everyone, I'm trying to figure out if I got ripped off by my local service center. I have a 2017 M2 with 13k miles. I bought it used a year ago, and this is my first BMW, so it was my first experience with them.My car said routine service was due so I took it in. The rep scanned the key fob and said he recommended changing the spark plugs. The estimate was $1200 parts and labor. I couldn't understand how it could be so expensive, or even necessary after so few miles. He replied that they recommend changing plugs after every third oil change, and that hard driving can require early replacement. My alarm bells were ringing, but I figured the previous owner could have tracked the car. So, I said it was okay if they took a look at the forward plugs (which he said were more accessible), and get visual confirmation on their state.Explaining the cost, he said it was a 4 hour job due to the need to remove the intake manifold to access the rear plugs, plus $240 in parts.A few hours later he called back to say they did indeed recommend replacing the plugs. I said okay. When I picked the car up, parts + labor for the plug replacement was $1088. He said he saved some time on the labor, so it was a little less than the $1200 estimate.I feel like a may have been a sucker here. But it was my first BMW service center experience, and at the time his explanation seemed plausible.I did manage to get a couple of the old plugs from him and have attached a picture.Basically I have three questions:1) Is there any scenario in which spark plugs need replacing after 13k miles? (e.g. the previous owner tracked it a lot).2) Did the spark plugs in the picture actually need replacing?3) Does the intake manifold needs to be removed to replace the plugs, justifying 3 - 4 hours service time"

I just had an SA try and tell me I was due for my rear diff fluid at my 4th oil change and 34k. Turns out they had reset my CBS at the break in, which they weren't supposed to do, so it looked like it was at my 5th change at 50k miles. They also wanted something like $340 which is ridiculous.\n\nGet a BMWCCA membership.  It will save you a minimum of 10% at your dealership.  Spark plugs are a maintenance item not a warranty item if that matters.\n\nThanks so much for all the feedback everyone. Makes me feel better if"

The M2 is regarded as being fairly reliable as far as BMWs go but but considering how much parts and labour on cars like these go for 1 or 2 medium repairs could easily make the warrenty worth it.That being said I've had a 2020 M2C for over two years and haven't had a single repair done.\n\nIts like insurance right? Sometimes you win, mostly you lose, but it gives you peace of mind.  The warranty company sells it and prices it based on a calculus that they will come out ahead in the end.  You could be the minority of people who have a bad car and get more out of it, or you could be the majority of people who will not get enough use out of it.  You decide what you are comfortable with.  I never buy any of that extended crap or wheel/tire insurance, etc.\n\nI opted for the upgrade to full maintenance for the 4/50k warranty period.

I think it will be hard to beat what shell offers because the GTL formulations that shell has results in really low NOACK ratings, and HTHS is solid with shell products as of late.2) If you are only using bmw TPT for warranty (because there are indeed cheaper and better oils out there such as pennzoil platinum euro 5w40) then there is no point of stocking TPT unless you really like it, or only want to use"

While I was there, the SA suggested that I could have the 10k service done as well to \"get it out of the way\". I asked him if there would be any adverse effects doing it so early since the next service wouldn't be till a bit later. He said no.Since I am roughly around 5.5k miles on it, my question is, should I be concerned that he was suggesting this service being done so early or is he correct that it doesn't matter if I got the service now at 5.5k or at 10k.\n\nThe earlier the service is done, the earlier your service will come up, so your interval maintenance that YOU have to pay for will be sooner.But my dealer did something similar that worked in my favor.  My warranty is out in December, and with only 14K on the clock they agreed to do the plugs on the car, which I think is supposed to be at 20K, but with how little I drive the car I would have needed that service at the end of next year or later (and it would have been on my dime), so they did them early for me.\n\nIf your car notified you of the service get it done..Your service intervals are time AND/OR mileage based whichever comes first. Yearly or 10k. Regardless of which occurs you'll get the same number of maintenance items within your warranty.Skip it and you'll void your warranty for not having service done when your car called for it. Choice is yours.If your car hasn't reached either milestone then ignore the SA.\n\nThanks guys.

There is an indicator that let's you know when it is charging. It only charges when there is no gas input so on the highway, unless you're going downhill for a stretch you tend to be constantly on the gas to maintain speed.\n\nOk I will pay attention to this ...so you technically will get a better charge letting it idle then on the gas driving ...interesting .\n\nIf you don't drive your car for 10 days, especially in cold months, it's best to get a trickle charger. Letting the battery drain like that will decrease the life of the battery.\n\nThis would be the first car that I would need to charge for not driving it for 10 days .Granted I never had a car that used up so much juice on accessories .Am I confused or do most other cars constantly charge the battery from the alternator the whole time the car is running ?I mean weather"

On my receipt or work order sheet, I see the following part number for 65 quantity:83-21-2-420-467The truncated description says \"BMW MOTOR OIL SAE 0\", so the only thing I know is that it's a 0W oil. However, it's been hard to get any good information during this pandemic, as I'm not allowed to speak with the mechanics themselves due to social distancing, and the dealership itself (front desk, show room, etc.) is closed.Has anyone seen this PN before? Any idea what oil I got? Maybe it was a typo. I live in Toronto, Canada.Thanks!\n\nDid you ever end up finding out what they used? I also went in for a CBS oil change, it reports 'm-car oil and filter change' with the same oil you received (83-21-2-420-467 SAE 0).

Unless you track the car I would stick to the 0w30 that the car was intended to have for warranty purposes - especially when the dealer is doing it and it is being recorded.Remember the BMW twin power turbo 0w30 oil is extremely stout, so no need to go to a thicker oil unless you really heavily track the car. That being said 0w30 is so stout it can even handle track use without issue.\n\nI asked for 0w-40 because I do indeed track my car, and I really have nothing to lose because BMW's 0w-40 is LL-01 and is suitable for the M2, despite it not explicitly listing it in the owner's manual:https://www.bmw.ca/en/topics/offers-...0-1000-ml.htmlQuote:Suitable for all BMW M models with petrol engine, except M5/M6/Z3 M/Z8 before model year 2011, M3 before model year 2014.

Has anyone with experience in smog testing or BMW emissions engineering systems seen or heard of this?100 miles may or may not be enough. I think a post above pointed to things you can do to for \"readiness\". For what it is worth, I had to drive 800 miles for my 335d to be ready some time back. Diesels are allowed to have two sensors with incomplete readiness in Calif. Otherwise? I think only one sensor is allowed to have incomplete readiness. The process got the best of me so I beat the car hard for 10-12 miles on a crappy mountain road. Worked! Sold the car with a worn left-hand side motor mount. Not related ;-)Many code readers will let you scan for sensor readiness. Worth it to get one regardless.\n\ndefinitely not a bmw thing.  all obd2 cars need to have their self checks complete to be considered \"ready for testing.\"  extremely common issue, \"100 miles\" is just a \"that oughta cover it\" distance.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bythebiglubinskyHello,I just had my new 2021 M2 smog tested here in CA.

After my car is warmed up I'm getting a slight buzzing noise at slow speeds.  *Seems* to be when I depress the clutch but also happens on decel in first gear.  Only does it when warmed up.  Also doesn't do it every single time.  Not a given that it'll happen.  Also can't hear it from outside the car, so given that we have crappy roads here it makes me wonder if it's something else just vibrating.Also I'm apprehensive to take it to the dealer because I'm the only manual transmission M2, or even BMW, in the country.  Not sure they'd even know what they're looking at.  Also they likely won't know how to drive the car to even diagnose it.Anybody have any thoughts?\n\nI get clutch chatter when sitting at a light after driving for a while, usually when I shift to neutral while I wait for the light, goes away if I clutch in and out quickly.\n\nI'll keep an ear to it to see if it gets worse or not.Now I'm really not sure, because it does it when I clutch in (sometimes) but also while driving at slow speeds in gear clutch out.

So the first service, after the break in should be at 10K miles or March 2021, whichever comes first right?Would love to hear your thoughts here as I am super confused!\n\nDealer is likely right, it's likely they are telling you what the software is telling them.  It's all covered anyway, so why not take it in for service?  What does your car say?\n\nFirst regular service is one year from the manufacture date.  You can see the manufacture date on the driver side door pillar.I assume that the car sat on the dealers lot for quite sometime before you bought it.  The breakin service does not reset the service intervals.Take it in.  It is a free service anyway.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byThescout13Dealer is likely right, it's likely they are telling you what the software is telling them.

Since my M3 was Euro delivery, the car called for it one year after I picked it up at the Welt, which was in 6/2016 (car was produced 4/2016).  Likewise, I ordered my M2C in spring 2019, it was produced in 4/2019, I picked it up late 6/2019, and the car called for the first oil change 6/2020.Obviously, there is no downside to having the service done now other than inconvenience.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDanGFirst regular service is one year from the manufacture date.

I'm trying to work out if this will save me money I do minimal miles around 6k per year. I haven't had any services as yet. The costs i have worked out so far from BMWs site:RIS £300Brake fluid £62 shows due 8/23Vehicle check £80 due 08/24 or 37k milesOil service and filter £263 due 08/22 or 17k miles.For brake fluid I'm guessing will only need one of these in the 5 years.For oil service will need 2 based on time rather than mileage.The question is on the 2nd oil service/vehicle check do they also change the spark plugs as this takes it from a £263 service to a £965 service and then the pack will be worthwhile. They also have a spark plug service for £495 every second oil change not sure how this is different to the oil change plus spark plug service cost of £965Would normally call my dealer but the offer expires at midnight tonight.\n\nI'd say it's worth it! and also I'm jealous you have that offer, I don't have it and probably because my car is 2 years old now....Brake pad service is on year 3 for £99"

Does it do anything that I can't do with a jack + axle stands? No, but it is faster and does provide a bit more lift than I could get with my axle stands.My M2 is my daily and I also use it at the track pretty frequently from April through October. I do 1 or 2 oil changes per year, several brake fluid changes, and for each track day it is a tire & brake pad change. I prefer having the car level for oil changes rather than using ramps. Lifting the entire car in 1 go, then using my impact gun I can do a full tire change in 10-15 minutes (for winter/summer change). When I do a brake pad + tire change for track days, it's 1 hour or so. Brake fluid changes usually add 30 - 45 minutes because of the way I use my power bleeder. I think lifting each corner individually would easily add 15 minutes to the process or more.I also use the QuickJack for performing winter/summer tire change overs for friends and family and it saves a bunch of time there too. The extra lift it provides makes it a bit easier doing coolant and power steering work. I suspect it'll make things a bit easier for replacing springs and dampers too.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byaeroglavaI've seen a few threads on here about the"

Thanks!Used mine for Charge Pipe install as well as Intercooler install. Have used it for oil changes, and switching out Oem to Track Pads. Will use it soon to install Autosolutions Short Shifter, which requires removal of Stiffening Brace and Drive Shaft and Exhaust. Worth it in my experiences. I feel much safer under car with this lift. and allows a good amount of room to work with. Would love to have a full lift in my garage, but there is no headroom for one.\n\nI just bought one. Final straw/motivation to pull the trigger was looking at the hourly cost of our local DIY shop to rent a list for a coilover install. A full day with the lift would have been roughly half the cost of the Quickjack, so I went for it instead.I’ve wanted one for a while, and didn’t really want to do the install on jack stands. I’ve never really been comfortable under a car with all four corners on jack stands. (I also installed toe links on the rear and torque arms on the front).

Just that alone justifies the cost, or most of it.I'll be adding an exhaust and an SSK and getting my calipers powder coated soon, and the QuickJack will be very handy for these installs/upgrades...I painted a logo on my FMIC and have needed to repaint it once. Need to again, actually due to rocks hitting it on some hard Dragon runs out in NC. Much easier to do this having FMIC off the car while the car is on the lift.Then there's brake fluid and pad changes, all easier on the QJ.Oil changes are also easier / a lot more comfortable to do now"

Seems weird for it to disappear when you wash the car though.....Did you take the wheels off and inspect the brake shields?Maybe effect of water and or soap temporarily changing/lubricating sound? Still the most likely culprit and easy to find out.\n\nI've had a similar noise to the video posted above where there's a noticeable ticking noise when turning the wheel but it only happened after driving on canyon roads for some reason. However I brought it to my local bmw dealership and they stated this is a known issue. They cleaned some surfaces between the face of the wheel hub and replaced some bolts. That seemed to do the trick since I haven't heard the same ticking noises ever since.\n\nI had a clicking noise less than a year in on my 2017 6MT.  Was similar sound to the video and only when turning.  Was rocks in the rotor shield in back.  At the time I was not aware of the SIB to replace the shield.When it happened again right before my warranty was going to expire, I brought it back in and asked them to replace the shield under the SIB since the same thing was happening.  They fixed the problem, but said it was the strut \"top hats.\"  They replaced them both, along with a mess of washers and bolts.  I don't trust them and the sound was pretty much exactly the same as it had been before, but the sound is gone and hasn't come back so I can't really argue with them.Happy to post the service order if you think it'll help."

It takes some stress off the threads and will help prevent leaks.\n\nIt's best to always replace the crush washer.I typically buy extras and keep them in my toolbox.\n\nsince you'll be there already, replace the washer. just think of the consequence if the plug starts causing an oil leak...then you'll pretty much have to do it all over again. keep it simple and do it once.\n\nI think he means there are 2 washers in the box, not whether he should use the washing included with the new filter.  Sometimes they include two washers since some models use the same size filter but require different size washers.  So they include 2 to let you choose based on which one fits your car.\n\nTo clarify,  the oil change kits that different companies put together include a separate drain plug washer in addition to the oil filter.  Here's FCP Euro's kit as an example, which is calling it an \"Engine Oil Drain Plug Gasket.\"https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw...11427854445kt1My question is do I need this extra drain plug washer, or is the one that comes with the oil filter sufficient?\n\nTo follow up, the one that came with the filter matched the one that the dealer put on the car at the last oil change.

I tried contacting BMW and get an answer on why they go with 0W-30 on M2 while M3 is fundamentally the same type of motor got the M 0W-40?

Castrol's current lineup of offerings is inferior to penzzoil platnium euro 5w40 as pennzoil uses a GTL base stock so it is quite clean. The new reformulation also brings HTHS up to 3.8 so it is currently the best oil available that is also LL01 approved imo only matched by motul xcess gen 2 which is 2X more expensive. So I would stick with PPE 5w40 at Canadian tire, no need to go south looking for oil as we have the 5L jugs readily available unlike in the US.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychip_dip19Interesting.

I have an Eventuri CAI which has given me a CEL since Ive installed it about a year ago and figured it might be normal since its aftermarket. After the install of the CAI I thought I felt the car a bit sluggish but didnt pay much attention to it thinking it was just in my head. Now the dealer is saying that the technician mentioned that they did feel a lag and they recommend changing out the spark plugs, $475. They didnt specify and I didnt ask(forgot to) if it was The total for parts and labor. He said if the spark plugs didnt fix the lag issue, that they would move on to replacing the coils. My maintenance warranty ran out in April 2020 so Im SOL and would have to pay out of this out of pocket.Could it be that it does need spark plugs? Could it be that there is a leak on the CAI? Or could it be that my charge pipe has cracked and has an air leak?If I could save the money by avoiding spark plugs and possible coils change that would be great.By the way car is at approximately 26k miles.\n\nWhat are the benefits of this intake again?I mean besides giving a CEL, making the car feel sluggish and costing a bucket of money?On a more serious note, the spark plugs are probably due for a change anyway so you should still consider doing this.\n\nYou know, obd2 diagnostics exist for a reason. It's quite simple to log our cars to check if there are misfires.

    "text": "reason. It's quite simple to log our cars to check if there are misfires. Pisses me off that dealerships are still recommending parts changes without doing tests first.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FUELEDSo I took my N55 M2 to the dealership on some minor issues also including that I felt a lag on the car. Felt slower and sluggish than normal. I have an Eventuri CAI which has given me a CEL since Ive installed it about a year ago and figured it might be normal since its aftermarket. After the install of the CAI I thought I felt the car a bit sluggish but didnt pay much attention to it thinking it was just in my head. Now the dealer is saying that the technician mentioned that they did feel a lag and they recommend changing out the spark plugs, $475. They didnt specify and I didnt ask(forgot to) if it was The total for parts and labor. He said if the spark plugs didnt fix the lag issue, that they would move on to replacing the coils. My maintenance warranty ran out in April 2020 so Im SOL and would have to pay out of this out of pocket.Could it be that it does need spark plugs? Could it be that there is a leak on the CAI? Or could it be that my charge pipe has cracked and has an air leak?If I could save the money by avoiding spark plugs and possible coils change that would be great.By the way car is at approximately 26k miles.When you're out of pocket on costs, never trust the dealer to do an investigation. Dealerships aren't designed to be cost efficient. Go to a reputable independent shop that specializes in BMWs, or get yourself an OBD2 scanner. See if there are codes that can provide you with insight before you start throwing parts at the problem."

Nope.As annoying as the upfront cost might be, it is much safer to get engine related work done by an authorized dealer.

If I change my charge pipe they will void my warranty.If you're under warranty then you shouldn't have to worry about the charge pipe at all, if it blows and takes your motor with it then they'll replace everything for you.My opinion is just wait out the factory warranty till like the last month and then swap out to an aftermarket charge pipe.Like others have said a class action law suit would probably net you zero money since it has happened to so many people.\n\nI don't understand how an improvement like an after-market charge pipe voids the warranty?!?!

In the USA you guys have the magneson moss law that in essence says you cannot lose warranty due to a mod unless proven the mod caused the failure.So if you get an engine failure maybe the dealer can pin it on your charge pipe leaking boost, interfering with the sensor idk.

Why would you be adamantly against it, if it forces the company to uograde their charge pipes on future builds thats a good thing no?\n\nGiven that its likely the majority of the N55 chargepipe failures occurred on either modified cars or track-driven cars, I doubt there is a large enough base to even consider a class action suit. And I'm sure the BMW lawyers will bring up this fact in court. If they can prove the majority of the plaintiffs were using the vehicles in extreme conditions (track), or have modifications, the class action lawyer will have no chance of winning. Theres just no money in it for anyone involved.So you have a couple options here. Ride it on the stock chargepipe until it fails, and replace it under warranty. Or replace it now for a"

Then hold down the traction control button until DSC Off mode is enabled. Then hold the brake down, then press the gas pedal to the floor. If launch control is active, you will see so on the instrument cluster and the car will hold revs at 3500rpm.

I think its too late for that as any evidence is destroyed (im thinking the disk was not properly hardened). Only the first couple mm of the disk are hardened thats why they are toast after the min. thickness.If your disk is under the minimum wear you should replace it ASAP as you are now wearing the \"soft\" metal. This will reduce braking performance and cause all the issues you are mentioning.Also the brake pads start with about 17.9mm of material and are done when they have 3.7mm of material left.

Well if you guys are tuned and are buying non-factory plugs (like the ever so popular NGK 97506 2 step colder plugs) that are not pre-gapped it is important to set the gap to either factory specs, or whatever your car requires as determined byReading the plug, and looking at your cars conditions - not just following the norms set by the internet as you want the largest gap possible to enhance combustion of the air fuel mixture in the cylinder. To set this gap you do not want to be tapping the plug against a hard surface because that could cause damage to the plug itself, instead you'd want a precision instrument to slowly and gently set the gap to ensure you do not damage the plug itself or close the gap too far which could damage the delicate iridium tip.Now with that aside what kind of tools are there, well there are 2 options:1) Spending a little bit of money (only $35 so that's pretty much nothing) for a BMS spark plug gap tool:https://burgertuning.com/collections...g_gapping_tooland doing this properly the first time.2) Cheaping out like I did and buying an absolute POS from China, aka typical aliexpress garbage. Now this is not to trash on made in China, because alot of good quality things like iPhones are made in China.

Combined with the anodized threads it makes it really smooth and easy to screw down with small turns - which is vital to not over tightening your gap.The next extremely important aspect is the screw itself, it is a dog point screw with a flat point. This means the thread itself ends a couple of mm before the point of the screw which is also flat and smooth. This is incredibly important as it contacts the electrode ground on the spark plug itself you do not want it to damage that part. As you can see in the last image the spark plug looks unscathed after use with the bms tool. This is a used spark plug too with some combustion residue left on the electrode ground itself. This residue is extremely soft and easy to scrape off, and you can see the BMS tool didn't even make a mark which is incredible.b) Aliexpress:Immediately you can see that the screw portion of the aliexpress tool is just a standard screw where the threads go all the way to the end. Even worse the screw is jagged at the tip and not even flat, this means when you turn the screw it will actually dig into the spark plug electrode ground itself causing damage.

There are serious warranty implications if you don't.  It seems quite stupid but that's the reality.You 100% NEED to have them do the run in service. Without that notation on your service history they will almost certainly void the engine warranty if something ever goes wrong for the life of the motor.

    "text": "This is gonna be a hodgepodge of my thoughts. I don't feel like spending more time proof-reading and editing this. So please excuse if it comes off a bit scattered an inelegant.So the OEM wipers suck. My M2 is 22 months old. 8 months of which I didn't drive my car because it was getting repaired from an accident. Probably another 2 months total it was in a shop getting upgrades. And probably a bunch more of ownership time I wasn't driving in situations that require wipers. In my experience, wipers should last much longer than this.The problems I'm having is the wipers chatter bad and leave streaks now. Even worse when there is some salt on the windows.In my previous vehicle I found the best combination was RainX 2-1 washer fluid, and their Fusion wiper blades. However both of these are no longer available. Seems that the fluid was discontinued, because it's become ridiculously hard to find. And the other fluids do not compare to it. Either because they have too high of a freezing point, don't offer water beading, or include bug&tar solvents... And for what happened to the blades I like, RainX doesn't make those blades for our car.For fluid, on paper it seems that Prestone 3-1 is comparable. It's a little more costly. Almost twice as expensive. But it includes water beading formula and doesn't include bug&tar solvents. I find the bug&tar fluid is an unnecessary solvent. Let's say it eats through bugs, it's just gonna smear bug guts all over your window. If bug are your problem, don't use your wipers and wash your car. Also I rather not have solvents in the fluid as I feel it eats through ceramic coating. Even the OEM BMW fluid has destroyed my ceramic coating and I believe that just has alcohol in it.Ok, wiper blades."

Even the OEM BMW fluid has destroyed my ceramic coating and I believe that just has alcohol in it.Ok, wiper blades. My requirements are that they last and look good. They can't be an eyesore. Some have big bulky attachment points. This is my first time using the I&L connector, previous car was J-hook, and it seems the bulky attachment isn't an issue with I&L but we'll see.RainX has 4 blade options for our car:RainX Arch: Is an entry level blade. I'm not an entry level man, so no thanksRainX Water Repellancy: What you do with these is run the blades for a few minutes on a dry window after you first install them. This applies a water beading coating to the window. I think this is a stupid way to accomplish this. After a little while, the coating wears off the blades and is useless. I find it's better to apply a ceramic coating and/or use water beading washer fluid to accomplish this. The blades are around $19 each.RainX Silicone Endura: These are their new top line product. They use a silicone wiper blade. I haven't used them, but they seem really nice. These have a symmetrical pyramid shape to them.RainX Silicone Advantage: These are the same as the Endura, but have an asymmetrical shape to them. Here is a picture of what I'm talking about. These are $34 each. And are available at my local Advanced Auto with a $20 discount, so this is what I am going to give a try.Additionally, another OEM+ upgrade brand I found is Trico. However, they have so many options available that I gave up trying to figure out their differences and pick one. I believe they generally are cheaper than the $34"

And there is other more important stuff I needed to take care of. But writing this post got me excited to buy these things. So I'm heading to the store right after I submit this post. Will update with my experience.And if anyone else has a better blade they recommend, leave a comment with it. I really only did an hour or so of research and am posting my findings and thoughts. So there may be something better I'm missing.\n\nSo I did end up purchasing the RainX Advantage blade, and I'm not happy with them. They have an ugly dumb connector that I refuse to have to look at everyday. Will be returning them tomorrow. I have a feeling there isn't going to be anything out there that resolves this, because all blades I've seen have universal mounting brackets that accept adapters to different blade types, causing the mounting point to become excessively large for a single applicationHere are some pictures compared to stock\n\nhave you tried Bosch icons?"

Mine is DCT, its like something hitting the transmission tunnel (a proper clunk) during light 1-2 or 2-3 shifts.  Or downshifts, makes me wonder if it's just a mount. , or a loose shaft.  My car has less miles than yours, I looked underneath the car, its surgically clean.  Its annoying as hell.  Does not really affect how it drives though.  Thoughts yourself?\n\nHonestly this just sounds like a regular/normal noise caused by driveline lash.  My 128i does this (with and without an LSD installed).  My E36 M3 did it.

Nonetheless, after I received them, I lifted the car with the new adapters to verify a good fit of the adapters into the jack points under the car. As you can see, the fit is perfect. What I enjoy most of these stands is how lifting the car with a jack and securing it with a stand, all in one process, is so easy, not to mention the robust construction providing a very solid base.I store my two stands in a large, Harbor Freight canvas tool bag, which makes transporting the stands very easily to car meets. The interchangeable lift point adapters also make these versatile to use on other cars.Recommendations:1. Low profile jack.2. Factory ride height setting, otherwise you will need to lift the car first with a jack, place a 2x6 board under the front wheel in order to create space under the lift point and the Safejack adapter."

I came in for an oil change, and they returned it without changing the oil?!? Condition Based Maintenance not met.Talk to the service manager, and as a result of resetting the oil change interval BMW won't reimburse the dealership for my oil change.I explained (again) that I had a different shop change the oil due to my needs, and that I am due an oil change per the service agreement.

There is no record in BMW's system of me getting an extra oil change. I have more than 10k on the car, so it's not an argument regarding the annual oil change standard.Any thoughts on how to proceed?Might this need to be a warning to those out there resetting their service interval for more frequent oil changes?Yeah I wouldn't think of it as \"I get 3 or 4 free oil changes\" but more that they will change the oil when needed based on the computer's recommendation. If you do it elsewhere and the CBS is reset, you are unfortunately giving up that free oil change. I get where you are coming from, but this is how it works.I change my oil in between BMW's recommended service.BMW - 1200 MilesMe - 5000 Miles (don't reset CBS)BMW - 10000 MilesMe - 15000 Miles (don't reset CBS)etc...\n\nAlso don't forget that regardless of the mileage on the CBS, the dealer will also change the oil once per year under the maintenance plan, as should you if you're not driving enough to trigger personal/CBS mileage guidelines.\n\nIn Yoorup, the service intervals are 24 months...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byrocketman99Also don't forget that regardless of the mileage on the CBS, the dealer will also change the oil once per year under the maintenance plan, as should you"

Once it became loose, it just spun.  It won't come off at all. Anyways, I see the pan online going for $850-$1200.  Most of them being priced in the upper $800's.I've spoken to 3 shops and waiting on 1 to call back.  The first shop said he would attempt to re-thread the pan, but couldn't promise it would work.  He also stated he never accepts parts brought in by customers.  He didn't provide a quote.  The 2nd shop quoted me $3000+ for the pan, bolts, gasket, oil, etc. installed.  They refuse customer provided parts as well.  The explanation \"We can't warranty the parts provided by the customer, therefore we do not accept them\".I'm in the SF Bay area and trying to find a shop that will re-thread the pan or accept customer bought parts.  It doesn't make sense for me to purchase the same oil pan for $1200 when it is available for $850ish at a ton of online retailers.  Also, if anyone has a link to a DIY for the pan replacement, that would be awesome.  I have been looking for an hour now and don't see much of anything.\n\nHave you considered taking it back to the establishment that caused the damage and simply indicate that you noticed oil on the garage floor and you'd like it checked ?

While waiting for the tool to arrive, I was checking things out and came across what appears to be loose fluid lines that I cannot find the name for (two combined aluminum pipes about 1 cm in diameter each) that run to/from the coolers that sit in the lower right and left of the front facia. In order to see if these are loose, you'd have to remove the black plastic shielding between the bumper cover and the metal stiffening plate. The lines sit on top of square aluminum tubing. I doubt anyone wants to do this to check, but I am wondering if anyone who has had theirs off can recall if the pipes are normally a little loose or if they should be tight. I imagine they shouldn't wiggle with my hands. Thoughts? Thanks!Not sure if this picture location will work:\n\nThose tubes are not held by screws but just plastic rivets which can move a bit in their holes so it's normal.Item #6\n\nThanks Tano!"

With this whole COVID19 thing going on I'm thinking about waiting another month or so until things have calmed down a bit before getting it done but I'm curious if I would be screwing myself out of a free oil change.The car only has 4k miles on it and I'm not driving it really at all since everything is locked down so I'm not worried about damaging the engine.  I'm just curious that if I delay this change by a month will I not be able to get the oil change at the end of the 3 year free oil changes?  Since all the timings will be shifted over by a month?  Realistically all of my oil changes with this car will be time based, not mileage based if that helps.\n\nYou should be fine with waiting a month and maybe even longer. Call your dealer that services your car and talk to them. Service departments should be open but sales departments in many places are closed.\n\nShouldn't be an issue in terms of getting all your warrantied services done during the warranty period.  I've been late a few months in the past and BMW has honored all my services.  I'm sure your service advisor will be accommodating with everything that's going on.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bycb804You should be fine with waiting a month and maybe even longer.

    "text": "So I am finally getting close to 2000km or 1200 miles and am going to get the break in service soon!2 questions:first, just confirming oil service and differential fluid change are what should be done at the break in service? (the canadian service manual curiously only describes break in service for the m5 and m8 and is silent on the m2c)second, is it open season after the break in service? Can I drive it like I stole it or should I gradually progress to higher rpms, more throttle and more steady driving?\n\nI drove it like I stole it after 500 miles, so I would say have at it! There are a huge range of believes/theories on break in of vehicles. BMW says limit rpms until 1200 miles, so open game after.  Do what makes you comfortable and happy.\n\nWhat I like to do after break-in is open it up more and more and vary the rpms even more but higher in the rpm range.  Everything will seat in so much better and quicker by stressing the engine progressively.   These are fast cars so unless you stay in 1st and 2nd gear and scream the engine, it’s hard to really stress the engine out and stay anywhere near legal speed limits.I turned the traction control off last night on my asphalt drive way that is long and goes up hill.  I wanted to see how easy it would brake traction and at 1/3 throttle it took off and left a 10’ patch before I even knew it was letting loose and I am still breaking in my car with lower rpm’s.    It was impressive to say the least but I now have two landing stripes on my driveway.I have been driving awd 911’s for so long I forgot the joys of being a rwd hooligan.\n\nIt was open season for me.

So let me modify my question to is this normal?\n\nDoesn't sound normal. Has your windshield ever been replaced by third party? It's possible you need your front camera calibrated\n\nThanks for the response.  Its the original windshield so either its the camera you mentioned or possibly auto wipers to BMW is intermittent (explaining why its swipes 1 time on startup even when dry just like it would when you first turn it on which to me would be a oversight in software programming) meant to be turned off every time before you turn off the car unlike auto headlights which I just leave in auto perpetually.

Although they may technically be the same oil, one is marketed before 2018 and another after 2018.  After 2018, Pennzoil has an additional test standard that designates their oil with the SN PLUS label which is a further designation indicating it is better for turbocharged GDI engines such as ours in preventing LSPI (low speed pre ignition) which could be devastating for the health of our engines.  Now the two oils may in fact be identical but personally I feel more at ease using an oil with the SN PLUS label....also as of May of this year watch for a further enhancement in engine oil standards with the new label"

In their FAQ they say they consider it \"the cost of doing business to keep customers coming back\"So maybe it's a business expense and a tax write-off for them? Doubt it, but that'd be a cool loophole if it was.I was looking for Castrol SRF and came into a guy on a Porsche forum saying that he uses the guarantee for brake fluid and oil, that's how I came across this. But they don't have the brake fluid in stock, so there is nothing I need right now to take advantage of this. But maybe someone else here can.\n\nThey probably don't have that many people that actually take advantage of it.  I've bought several things from them over the years - their shipping location used to be close enough to just go pick my orders up. Brake parts are probably the only things I've ever ordered that qualified and I just didn't think of it when I needed new brake parts.I would have never realized it was good for fluids though.  The idea of buying an oil change kit once and returning the old oil for free oil changes \"forever\" is pretty appealing. I wonder if I can just drive it down to Milford.  it's a bit of a hike - but not compared to 90 bucks for fresh oil and filter\n\nYep it's been well touted for years. You just have to go"

You got the oil change and it sounds like, if I'm reading right, that you will get at least four in by the time your warranty expires.  You're not going to get five or an unlimited amount during that"

    "text": "Hi everyone,I have been experiencing an intermittent issue with my 6sp ever since new. 1st to  2nd gear grinds when shifting over 6500rpm. On a related note, this same phenomenon is only exacerbated by installing a clutch stop. I've posted about this before but basically if I run any level of clutch stop the grinding happens without fail. Naturally I removed it and for a while thought the issue was solved but I still occasionally get the grinding. Why this happens is beyond me and why others can run clutch stops without issue is also frustrating.Fast forward to a dealer visit about it. Unfortunately because it's not 100% repeatable they will not warrantee it. So it is what it is, I'm not terribly upset about it as it happens infrequently but do want to plan accordingly in the event I completely/eventually nuke 2nd gear.I know used transmissions are available for 15-2500 but would rather find someone to rebuild the trans I already have vs swapping in a used transmission with unknown history. That said, are these transmissions rebuildable? And can anyone recommend a shop that could handle it? I'm in SoCal but would ship the transmission to a specialist if need be. I would also love to chat with someone who has intimate expertise with these transmissions(if that exists) to see if they can make any recommendations about why my vehicle behaves like this.Thanks in advance\n\nGo to a different dealer, they should be fixing it for free. When I had an issue with my eccentric shaft actuator that was not repeatable I was concerned that I wouldn't be taken seriously so I ended up taking a video of the issue. Once I showed them that I was taken care of. They opened a TSARA case and asked to keep the car for a few days and gave me a loaner. Had the car back fixed under warranty within a week.\n\nI don't think another dealer would yield a different result. I am personal"

Aside from that I read charge pipe is another but other than that most thing don't need change until 40-50k mike right?Here is a list I complied from reading online and YouTub, tell me if this is correct.- water pump failure usually 30-70k mileage- oil leak ( valve gasket, oil panel), I have no idea what and where these are- vanos solenoid - higher mileage cars usually- spark plugs and coils, really anytime?- HFPF, higher mileage usually\n\nAdd the coolant hose as well to be changed before 40-50k. They become very brittle and can burst on their own or when touched. Very common on the 2addicts forum\n\nYou have yet to do enough mileage (and the car is too new) for any of that list to be a problem.But, noting that something about the US driving environment appears to do drastic things to even fully synthetic engine oil, you may with to get it and the filter changed every 12 months / 10k miles.\n\nSpark plugs get done at your final oil change service before the maintenance plan expires."

If you have a decent jack I would trust it enough to stick my head in the wheel well and give everything a wipe.For extra safety just chuck a tire/wheel under the car. So if it does come down it lands on that and stops the brakes/suspension from touching the floor.BTW I never put my head anywhere it could get crushed by a failing jack."

Wanting to hear everyone's thoughts if you've had this done and if you went with the OEM BMW 75w80 fluid or went with something else like Redline MTL.Thanks in advance!\n\nNoting that before Long Life fluids were introduced, BMW appear to have recommended changing the fluid every couple of years, your car which is filled with Long Life fluid - is unlikely to need a change for some time.Obviously, if you believe the \"Lifetime Fill\" message, it will end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy, but you still shouldn't need to touch it for several years.But, it's your car, so change it when you feel like doing so.HTH\n\nI'm sticking to BMW stuff on the M2, but I used Redline and SyncroMax on my Mustang before.Both were better for high temp use, but struggled at low temps in the cold months.

My question to him was if you take delivery there, how does that work since the car has the break-in period up to 1200 miles.  He responded that the car can be driven immediately on the track.  I told him from my research that wasn't the case and that the manual even says it has that break-in period.  So, for those of you that have gone there for the delivery/school, does that mean you have to drive a loaner or are you able to drive your car?

You drive the same model you have purchased from PCD fleet.There are numerous threads on this, but you just do some \"advanced\" driving exercises, do some off-roading in a X5.

The earliest event sets off the service light.  You M2 is asking for a low mileage oil change due to time.The same information is briefly displayed each time you start your BMW in the instrument cluster.\n\nI had similar questions after my first break in service.  I recall being told that per BMW service protocol the indicators are NOT reset after that first service. Indicators were reset at dealership for the two subsequent oil changes I have had since then..\n\nLike others said the interval is 10k miles or 1 year which ever comes first. But the service is also condition-based based on how you drive.I only drive about 8-9k miles a year in my F31 over the last 6 years I have owned it now and the CBS interval indicator usually comes on at 8k miles so. About half the miles in a year are fairly short trips and the the other half are long road trips. On a 2k mile road trip that is mostly the indicator won't lose any miles but a month of short trips where I drive only 700 miles the indicator might drop 1.5k miles.We will see how the wife's M2 does, we have only had it for 2k miles now.\n\nI have been told that it depends on"

Hard to do with 788M wheels though...\n\nThe pad wear sensors only indicate once the pads are worn down to a certain thickness (because it means the pad sensor actually also becomes physically into contact with the brake rotor/disc), at this point the system will give you an estimate until the pads will wear out entirely. I don't know exactly how the system will estimate wear until that sensor first starts reading, or whether it actually uses the number of km/miles between the sensor being reset (and physically replaced) and first contact to then extrapolate the remaining life or if it uses a fix km/mile range for telling you when the pads need replacing.I personally would not place much faith in the miles/km reading that the iDrive tells you for remaining pad thickness, only once it starts actually warning you that front and/or rear pads need replacing would I then be concerned about really checking how much life is left and booking an appointment to replace soon. Having said that, I track my car and so my pad wear sensors are never actually in the pads so they won't trigger for me but I am physically checking pad thickness before and after every event and before the season starts so I don't rely on the sensors"

I know their head tech, Colin, so I'll see if I can glean more info if I can bump into him.It must be documented somewhere (I'm going to start trawling that treasure trove of M2C info that's in one of these sub-forums - maybe service info is in there?)ETA - when making my booking last week, they offered me the Service Pack subscription.....£1,260 up front or £35/mth x 35 payments and it covers S1 service @ 15k miles (oil and microfilter) and S2 major service at 30k miles.

If so, seethis post.If you mean you want to adjust intervals, that isn't an option, the iDrive system has it's own idea about the Condition Based Service (CBS) intervals which aren't adjustable.To review the statuses, it is done through iDrive and probably varies based on version.

Your 5W-40 is good enough for the kind of weather you are having, so there is no need to change the oil just for cold temperature protection. With that being said, if you car already needs an oil change, you can try some 0W oil, but it is not necessary.\n\nMaybe I'm getting into the weeds a bit to much. Yes 5w40 is able to work down to -30° but I started looking into more detailsThe stuff I was planning on using, Motul 8100 X-cess 5W-40 looks like a great oil but viscosity at 40°C us is 86.2 & it's pour point is -36°C. From what I've seen, a lot of 0W-30 oils like the recommended BMW LL-01 FE 0W-30 are 70 vis & -50ish pour point.I've been searching around and found Liqui Moly Top Tec 4200 5W-30 that is rated LL-01 FE with a viscosity of 70 & Pour of -42 °C while still retaining a relatively high viscosity at 100°C of 12.2 vs the Motul 14.2 or roughly 12 of the BMW stuff.

I've been monitoring the oil temp gauge and have had trouble getting to \"ideal\" temperature in the middle of the range. For me, the range starts at 160F, and the middle is 250F. This seems high based on what I'm reading on here. I live in San Francisco (so usually 60 degree weather recently), and after going for drives for 1hr+, I still can only get to around 200-210F.So, I was wondering: (1) how do you guys usually get your car to temperature quickly, and (2) what temperature should I really wait for before pushing the car (after the break-in, of course)?\n\nIf you use sport plus mode for engine/throttle you activate the additional cooling and the temperature will not exceed 200F, use efficiency or sport mode to get the engine to temperature quickly and you will see 230/240FAt 200F the oil is hot enough to push the car to high revs.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by_RS4_If you use sport plus mode for engine/throttle you activate the additional cooling and the temperature will not exceed 200F, use efficiency or sport mode to get the engine to temperature quickly and you will see 230/240FAt 200F the oil is hot enough to push the car to high revs.Correct!I have the electronic steering wheel which allows me to monitor the exact temperature by degrees. Once it hits the 200F* threshold you're good to go, but it will take longer to get there if you're in Sport+. This usually takes about 10-12 minutes to reach in Comfort....\n\n^^^ what they said ^^^\n\nSo it's only Sport+ and not just Sport that has the increased cooling?

Using a logging tool you can watch the oil temps drop in real time when switching to Sport, Sport +, or DSC off. Traction and comfort will allow it to get a bit hotter.On the OG M2 if you push the car hard in any of the sport modes you can still get it up over the 200* mark pretty easily.\n\nGood Info here:  OLD BUT STILL EXCELLENT & REF HIGH BMW TEMPS\n\nI have noticed  that the M2C runs cooler than my previous M2."

    "text": "I just got this oil analysis done on my M2C. Bought it with about 3,500 miles and had oil changed at dealer at about 8600 miles. The break in service was completed at about 1500 miles. So about 7100 miles on the oil.My questions is has anyone had a similar result? Any suggestions on what to do other than change again in 5000 miles and retest?I was thinking I'd go to dealer and have them open a repair order with this info on it just so it is on the record.Appreciate any advice.\n\nI'm kind of in the same boat but not as bad. 12000 miles or so.\n\nCycle PilotThanks for sharing this.

I paid for everything out of pocket.\n\nYes, engine oil and diff fluid.  I don't believe in BMW \"lifetime\" fluids and will be changing the tranny fluid at 50K miles.\n\nThanks for the responses.  Especially to Speedsince.I didn't recognize the short line item for XJ-SAF.  It was sitting there next to oil, filter, crush washer etc.The service advisor didn't recognize the XJ-SAF line item either apparently, because he told me they didn't do the diff fluid anymore when I asked (i'm sure they are clueless and aren't involved much is what the techs actually are doing).After going through the invoice again, looks like it was done, just not easy to recognize.  Thanks to others for posting their receipts.  Wouldn't have known otherwise.\n\nThey changed diff fluid on my 2020. Not sure if it makes a difference but I had my 1200 service done in Germany.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMisterGooberJust got back"

No transmission update.However this diff update completely messed up the steering feel. The on center now has lot of slack and overall steering feels disconnected and less taut.

The clutch plate? Flywheel? The tranny? Clutch pedal? Clutch hydraulic system (shared with brake hydraulics)?\n\nNoting that it doesn't appear to be possible to buy the friction and pressure plate separately, they would both have been replaced. The rest was inspected to make sure that it either wasn't contributing to the observed effects, or been damaged.But, I'm guessing.The phone call from the dealer was basically \"we've completed the service but the clutch is dragging and will need to be replaced\" (I had mentioned the 1st-2nd change as being reluctant on check in). They then went on to reassure me that it was covered by the warrantee, they had already ordered the parts for delivery the following day, so would pull the gearbox 1st thing and inspect it . If everything else was okay I could have the car back before the end of the day.As it turned out, they were done by lunch.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyIf it doesn't want to go into 1st or 2nd going - up or down - regardless"

Can't seem to find the origin under the car either. Has anyone run into anything similar?\n\nCould it be rain run-off water from the brake rotors? Have a look for any similar drips on the wheel rims?\n\nIt does look like dirty water.  wet it and see if you can wash it from the floor.  If so it's definitely not something oil based.\n\nThanks guys, this makes sense as I've washed it a couple times & pulled it straight in afterwards.  Just wanted to be sure it wasn't part of a larger issue."

Do the same for the rear then you can use a circle or square pad jack to put a jack pad adapter on it and then place it under the jacking point.

Best way to figure it out is measure the height of your jack, and the height of the m2 + the thickness of the wood in this case 2\".\n\nFor oil changes or down pipe changes, I just jack each side up and put a ramp under each front wheel.  Nice and stable.I have also drove onto a couple 2x6s under the fronts, then jack from Center jack point and carefully lowered onto stands that were on the side points (which is a terribly unstable process as my jack releases quite fast).  I dont do this anymore.Wheel swaps I just jack one side at a time and do it while car is on the jack.  The jack lifts the whole side of car, so both wheels at the same time."

Usually in the 7000-10000 mile range, I believe.Service starts the day you take ownership of the vehicle, and the computer synced itself the day you did the break-in service and it was reset.The free maintenance you quoted is for the US.  Not all countries have free maintenance.\n\nSame issue as OP here.Bought my 18 LCI in March and did my 1200 mile break in service in May.My Idrive shows that my service is overdue since 6/19 but my car is only at 3700 miles.Do I take it in asap or wait until I reach 7.5-8k miles for the oil change? Will I still be eligible for the free service?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bysharpst77Same issue as OP here"

You can do it in 15 minutes start to finish.\n\ni changed mine about a month ago.  to remove the oil filter you need a special socket, which i bought from turner motorsport.  i used mann oil filter, which is available at advanced auto.  if i remember correctly, the mann's oil filter came with two seals and a drain plug washer, so make sure you use those.i jacked up the car from the front center jacking point and rear diff and put it on floor jacks at the four corners.  i used a low profile longnose floor jack for the front.i changed the oil right around 5k miles because i don't buy the 10k interval bs.  i didn't reset anything after the oil change.  the whole process, from jacking up the car to dropping it down, took about 40 min.  i'm sure it can be shorter, but that was my first oil change on a new bmw, so i took my time.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCosmosMpowerAre any cars already outside of 40k miles?What does 40k have to do with it.

Absolute max interval for me is every 7500k.I'm guessing he is talking about the fact that they come with free oil changes under the maintenance plan\n\nChange is very easy.  A few notes from my first one:I ran the front of the car up on a set of ramps I have, gave me enough clearance to drain the pan.  Drain plug very accessible.As mentioned, the pain with the filter is needing a special filter socket tool. I tried without one but it wasn't moving, and since it's a plastic cover I wasn't chancing damage to it.  I bought this one, liked the rugged look of it, wasn't disappointed, great fit, good quality:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N54IT33I went with the OEM filter, easy to get the cartridge out and replace it.I used BMW TwinPower Turbo LL01FE 0W-30 oil.Sent a sample out for analysis, all looked good, and now I have a baseline.I've decided to do twice as many oil changes as the car calls for with Condition Based Service.  So basically when the miles I had gone since the 1200 mile first change equaled the miles the car told me to the next service I did a change myself, and didn't reset the computer.  When normal service comes due I'll take advantage of the dealer offered service.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byGoSlow2GoFastChange is very easy.  A few notes from my"

It doesn't close completely, only half of the original opening.Initially, I thought that was a feature. If you park under the sun, you'd still want it partially open to alleviate the heat build up inside, but you don't want it completely open so to protect partially against dust and a potential rain.When I get back in and turn on the engine, the moon-roof doesn't return to the original open position. However, if I turn off the engine, again it automatically closes half.Eventually, it's practically closed. Not completely, but pretty much useless for air ventilation.Anyone observe that symptom? Or is it a defect in my car?\n\nAre you activating the automatic close function while locking the car? BMWs will automatically close windows and the sun roof if you hold the lock button on the remote (or keep pinching the comfort access). If you push the button very briefly then it shouldn't close anything.With coding you can also adjust how long you have to hold/pinch before things automatically close or adjust which features work (i.e. just windows, include roof and door mirrors).There is also the opposite feature for unlocking, holding the unlock button or comfort access will start opening windows and roof. This can be particularly handy on super hot days where your car will have baked in the sun for a bit, then you can let it vent a little before you get in.\n\nThanks. That's exactly what was happening.I figured it out:When I (normal) touch the door handle, the moonroof auto closes and mirrors fold.Somehow the moonroof stops before it completely closes. Maybe the system shuts down power before it can complete. But the mirrors fold fine.When I touch very briefly, door locks,"

    "text": "So I took my brand new M2 Competition in to fix few little things and I thought also to have an early oil change, ~250 miles on the clock, to clean the tolerances collected in the block. The dealership initially declined my request saying that they don't do it outside or the running in scheduled period but then it turns out my car is due servicing by July hence they will do it.Now my question is, how is it possible the car needs servicing so early and why do they do it so early when the runbook clearly says at 1200 miles? Ideas? Shall I get worried or it's all good and I will still need to stick to run-in procedure?Thanks in advance for your help\n\nThe first 2 service countdowns the car will do is break-in service at 1200 miles and 1st oil change at 10k miles OR 1 year from manufacture date. These 2 run concurrently and one does not affect the other.  If you have a service due in iDrive it's likely the yearly and likely because your car was manufactured in june or July of 2018 (you can check the VIN herehttps://decoder.bvzine.com/)\n\nHi there, not really, first order placed in October 2018 if I'm not mistaken, cancelled by December 2018, new order automatically placed in January 2019 manufactured in February 2019, car collected in March.This is the 1st service, running in, service. Let's even assume for a moment the car was manufactured in July 2018, my probably misinformed engineering background can't compute how the running in service could possibly be a timed one. The running in service is meant to remove all the crap and the tolerances from the moving parts hence my concern.\n\nDoes it actually say it needs service now or it needs service in X miles? maybe a picture of what the iDrive is tell you would help. mine technically says I need service (when I start it), but it"

I took the car willing in because I wanted to preventively change the oil anyway to remove the big part of the tolerances and then continue the run-in with peace of mind, they initially refused and then they said, oh but the diagnostic says it's due in July we will do it.Moreover, now, to add insult to the injury they busted the head unit with a software update... I'm so not pleased with it.\n\nSo, just a quick update, I collected my car today and I spoke with the head engineer in the workshop and spoke with him about the situation.Despite on the forum it was debunked that there are no special fluids in the car, I was told instead that was the case and that for that reason the running in service is also timed and that the internal sensors in the car detected that the factory oil deteriorated and needed replacement despite the low mileage. With that said he also told me that at this point, because I have proper oils in the car I can now be a bit more spirited with my driving and I can also take the car on the highway without worrying...

I'm use to the standard yellow low oil light from previous BMW cars, but what does the red light mean? (see pic...)\n\nIt's pretty self-explanatory.  Your car is telling you it's overdue for an oil change.  Did you just buy this car?  Either it hasn't had an oil change for a while or whomever did the last change didn't reset the reminder.  Either way your best bet is to schedule an oil change with your nearest dealer asap.\n\nI bought it new back in December, has less than 5000 miles and have done the break-in service.I wasn't quite worried at first, but then I tried BMW roadside assistance b/c I was curious how helpful they are. That's when the lady said the red light usually means engine oil pressure issues / don't drive it and instead have it towed. Was hoping to just drive it myself to the dealer but wanted to check if the red light means anything extra...\n\nhas it been 1 year since the 1200 mile service? most likely that. If you had low oil it would say oil is low. It clearly says you're just overdue for service\n\nit's been about 5 months since the 1200 mile service and the car itself is about 7 months old.\n\nIt literally says it on the screen.

My car is still in production.BMW has issued a voluntary recall for several types of cars...all 2 series, all 330xi's, all 4 series, the new Z4, M4's and M2's.  This is due to a supplier issue on the driver and passenger side airbags.  Because of a supplier issue in production, the driver and passenger side airbags could become damaged during deployment.There are approximately 11,700 vehicles affected by this.  It affects cars from 2018, '19 and '20.Currently your car does not show being affected by this recall, however, it has not advanced along the production process.

HTH.A dealer did print out the service records and from what we can determine the service indicator was reset at 830 miles (no mention of the break in service being performed which is concerning) and a engine oil change at 7800 miles. That's it. Car currently has 9500 miles on it.I need to do some more searching but I thought the manual transmission oil on M cars is supposed to be changed at 1200 miles.The M2 never had transmission fluid changed as part of break in service. The break in only covered engine oil and diff fluid (diff is very important in my opinion)Like the others have said the MT fluid is considered a lifetime fluid so whether or not you want to change is totally up to you.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bynioh_lbbm2The M2 never had transmission fluid changed as part of break in service.

Now i am approaching 3km, I usually do my routine \"personal-for-new-car\" second running in oil change and diff fluid change.Problem is that when I call up the dealership to order up the fluid, they keep telling me that 1L is the OEM spec.  So I check online and am seeing that some of our Swiss counterparts, thanks M Houbi, are indeed adding more.This makes me nervous so I ask the dealership to check my records on what they did for the 1200km running service and they confirmed they only used 1L.I asked them about it and they keep saying their system recommends one liter but I do think its wrong.I dont like to be a stickler over 17% difference of fluid but the problem is, is that I track and run cars hard.  Low diff fluid to me could mean a huge bill or a crash.

A car that was brought in for maintenance on a sporadic basis could raise red flags and lower the value.\n\nMany of us don’t hit the mileage mark in a year.  BMW does recommend the oil replaced once a year regardless of mileage.  Mine had a 8,000 miles on it when the dealer did the one year service.Take it in and get your free service.  Hopefully it won’t hurt your warranty for being late.\n\nYou will be fine. The dealer gets compensated for the annual work, which is one reason they want you to come in.\n\nBecause you changed it at 4k (what date was it), you effectively reset the annual clock at that interval.  Your CBS will never know that you did that oil change.IMO, because you've already thrown the CBS out of whack, you should get it changed again (guessing you're about 6 months or so since your 4k change?) and get the CBS reset.In the future, reset the CBS at every change and least keep a service record for the next owner.\n\nIf you miss your service by a certain amount of time the car will not be CPO able and not be eligable for some of BMW's extended warranties.\n\nJust to close this out, I took it in and they didn't bat an eyelid. All good. My dash now reads Apr 2020 for next service rather than Feb. Thanks for the feedback from all."

    "text": "Hi all,One of the other UK members mentioned yesterday that his coolant levels were low after picking up his M2C so I checked my level also after picking up my car on Friday and mine was also low, so I topped it up to recommended levels.I then later in the day drove about 10 miles to pick up a pizza and as I pulled in to the car park the engine was steaming. I looked under the bonnet and at that point I saw the coolant cap sitting in the engine bay where I left it as well as coolant spluttered all over that side of the engine. I know, I know, stupid mistake (I still can't believe I did this).I followed the trail of coolant and it looked like it only started leaking from the engine 150 feet away from where I parked my car. After picking up the pizza I put the cap back on, drove it home at the lowest revs possible and used a cloth to clean up all the coolant I could reach and then left the car to cool down.I have been reading that I should bleed the coolant system and I have seen some guides on this, but can you guys please advise me what I should do? If any one could show me a picture of where the bleed screw is explain what I need to do to bleed the system I would massively appreciate it!I am taking my car 50 miles to get some parts added tomorrow so I'd love to get this sorted today. Would it be ok to simply top up the coolant, drive the car and get them to sort this out? I would rather do it myself today if I had the right guidance.Thanks in advance and feel free to mock me for my stupidity. I feel pretty stupid for making such a rookie mistake, but hey ho, you learn from your mistakes and all that.Cheers,KarlP.S. for anyone wondering, it was a Spicy Hot from Dominoes\n\nI doubt you"

Sounds like your drive was not spirited, since the cap hadn't even moved from where you left it. Did you notice temp gauge at all on that drive?If you didn't get engine overheating warning, or a coolant low warning in iDrive, then the loss was likely minimal.I would top off the coolant before driving anywhere, and preferably bleed the system DIY as it is possible that, if there is air in there, even with coolant topped off, you may overheat your engine on that 50 mile drive. For sure not worth the risk. Meaning if you dont figure out how to get this done, reschedule the parts install.Guidance wise I wish I could help but have not done myself and i would say call service dept at local dealer and ask them to give you instructions?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byddk632I doubt you lost enough coolant to cause any damage.

I am still not decided as I am at 500 miles dealing with the break-in boring period. But in a few thousands miles, if I decide to join the \"I will change it sooner\" group I thought about doing it sooner and send it to analysis based on one experience I had with my e92 M3 (now gone).BlackRock did the Oil Analysis of the M3 when the oil was at 5K miles. I was changing it every 5K since I tracked the car, and I did the analysis because I wanted to keep an eye on any premature signs of rod bearing problems. The fact is Blackrock told me the oil was still within specs at 5K, and suggested I increase the intervals to 7500 miles. I sold the car before that, so I end up not knowing if at 7.5K the oil would still be within specs and they would suggest another bump in the change interval. but as an idea for who is worrying how about changing the M2 oil before the recommended interval, why not change at 7.5K then send it to analysis? I am far from being an expert, so am I missing something? Any other reason to change it if the oil stills within specs?By the way, if someone do it please share the results!\n\nMe as a licensed BMW tech - I change my Engine oil Every 5000kms on my M235.

When you use it, you can seal remaing mix and it's ready if needed next time.Then shine a light thru passenger side of the white rad water container, light  pointing to center of motor. You can then see how water level is indicated inside at seam. Hi tech, nice that.

So far so good.  Have done several track days as well.  Planning to send in for analysis since I'm only 1700 miles since changed.  Normally go 5k intervals.  I'll keep you posted.Update: got my analysis back from Blackstone.  Looks like the motul 300v 5w-40 is holding up really well. He mentioned the oil looks great and to think of extending interval by 1500 but I think I'll stick to the 5k with the track days.

BMW engines, in particular, utilize oil for several functions (double VANOS, turbo passages, etc) and the flow rates are affected by a thicker viscosity which will alter flow rates, depending on temperature and passage size.  I recently received a recommendation from a racing engine builder on this subject and his response was - BMW is very specific about oil viscosity and I would stick with their recommendation.Given they ran 10W-60 in the S65 V-8 and S54 I6 from the factory, they aren't doing it for fuel economy reasons.  It's around engine design and best protection/efficiency.It's your engine but factory recommendation is important - for instance, Jeep/Chrysler warns that their cylinder deactivation in the V-8 Hemi will not function as-designed unless you use the factory-recommended 5W-20.My $.02\n\nI agree with what your saying. Stick with BMWs recommendation. They recommend LL-01 oils and the 5w-40 oils mentioned in this thread so far have the LL-01 certification.Other oils with 0w-30, 0w-40, 5w-30 and 5w-40 weights are on the list.\n\n0W-40 for me.

I am quite concerned now, but I'm not sure how concerned I should be. It looks like it is missing the break in service and likely another oil change? If these do not show in the vehicle's status, does it mean it was not done?The car should have gotten checked over before I took ownership and the time/mileage to the next scheduled oil change seems to have been reset to 15,000 km or 1 year as if an oil change was just completed, but there is no service history of this. Could they do the service without it showing? What would be the best thing I should do or am I just concerned over nothing?\n\nThe easiest thing to do, and relieve any of those haunting thoughts, is hopefully get back to the dealer and get a print out of services done. It's doubtful that if a service was done as you feel it should have been, and rightly so, that it was not entered into their system. Go in, sit down and get the full picture. If for some reason it was not done at 12K then it should be done. Those 3K miles are not the end of the world. BUT that service interval registered in system at 12K is how the warranty is maintained. I would make sure they acknowledge that now...instead of later, claiming the car was not serviced at 12 as specified.

The previous owner barely drove it and the last oil service he did was beginning of the year at 3050 miles. It is now at 6000 miles and the 1 year/10K oil change is coming up in a month. This is fine, since I am used to doubling the frequency of the factory recommended oil changes anyway.However the car and BMW Connected are also showing that a \"Vehicle Inspection\" and \"Emission Inspection\" are due at the same time. I have never heard of these before, so can someone shed light for me. This can't be Inspection I can it? Based on my past experience Inspection I would not arrive until 20-30K. So can someone clue me in please what these inspections are? All the whiz-bang computer wizardry compared to my M Roadster where everything talks to each other is a brave new world for me. I didn't even have nav in my roadster.....Also, can someone point me to a checklist of what is performed at each service interval / inspection. I've been searching online but cannot find anything that is simple and clear. For my Z4M, I had a simple chart that showed mileage and which fluids would be changed, filters replaced, plugs changed, valve clearances adjusted, etc.Thanks!\n\nMystery solved on the Emission Inspection and Vehicle Inspection warnings. As a newbie to idrive, it never occurred to me that these might be user settable alerts for state inspection intervals. I just set both to the year 2040 to essentially disable them. Maybe there is a way to turn them completely off, but it doesn't matter right now. The state will send me a reminder for emissions testing, so there's no reason for my vehicle to be nagging me as well."

Got mine for around $90 if I recall.The evacuator works great, I use it on my GTI all the time but I am hesitant to ever use it on a car as nice as the M2 (even if I could) since I do believe it can miss quite a bit of oil depending on the oil pan design. It's not a fault of the Mityvac specifically, but extractors in general.The GTI pan I have is baffled (I think to prevent sloshing and starvation/low pressure situations) and a good few quarts can end up staying at the bottom un-extracted regardless of how much you keep pumping- and it's not like you will have the dexterity/visibility to reposition the suction hose to get each baffled section (all just in my experience)."

On average, 250-300km per month.Of courseNewTISis great reference (for free), however, I am looking for more detailed, structured, procedural instructions (what need to be done at certain time and/or odometre intervals, like what the dealership service department mechanics use/refer to, if exists). Mainly because my mechanic friend is busy with more cars than he can take care of (good business ;-), as a responsible owner I have to do my own homework well enough to check all, do preventative maintenance to avoid or detect commonly known issues of the N55 (N55B30T0)/F87.Current routine maintenance already in place- change engine oil (M TwinPower Turbo 0w-40 8*1L bottles) and oil filter ( once every 12 months or 5000km whichever occurs first.- trickle charge the battery using CTEK XS-0.8 (to 80% at least) per month to avoid electronic failures (which I had with the F25 LCI X3).TIA\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byterrywang...I am looking for more detailed, structured, procedural instructions (what need to be done at certain time and/or odometre intervals, like what the dealership service department mechanics use/refer to, if exists)...You can also find this information in the TIS under themaintenancesection.\n\nGreat information all.

    "text": "My wife and I bought an M2 Competition for European Delivery.  At some point during the driving, we noticed the yellow engine icon warning light coming on at startup, staying on briefly but longer than the other lights that flash on then go away.  Then, before or when we put the car in gear, the light went away.  It never came back on during driving, and iDrive never said anything about it.  Car didn't behave any differently.  Wife is paranoid that we exceeded the break-in limits and caused a problem.  I say we did not, since they aren't hard limits, just suggestions.  We briefly had the car over 106 mph (170 kmh given by our delivery specialist), but came back within 106 within a second or two.  Did not exceed the 5500 rpms (also given by delivery specialist), though we did get right up to it a couple times.  The more I read about it, the more I think it's a gas cap issue, perhaps something needing to be unplugged and plugged back in, or at worst a faulty sensor.  Honestly, we didn't spend any time trying to resolve this.  We had lots of places to go and had to get driving.  When I saw the light, I believed it was a non-issue, since it went away immediately, so I didn't dwell on it.  My wife is now dwelling on it and wondering what the issue is.It's the light at the bottom left in the picture below.  I know the car is not on in the picture, but the light did come on at startup as described above.Thanks in advance for your help, guys.\n\nYou tell me, is it staying on too long?LCI\n\nPlease read the owners information book.

It's the left side of the car, or top right of the engine bay if you're standing at the front looking in.I have always gone with rear right, rear left, front right outer, front right inner, front left outer then front left inner (remember, there's 2 nipples for the front calipers). I did that based on furthest to nearest to the reservoir.\n\nThanks for the confirmation. Didn't realise there were two bleeder nipples on the front!Also maybe mine is different (I have right hand side drive vehicle) - if standing in front of the car looking at the engine bay, the ABS module is under the plastic tab of the top right, and the reservoir is under the plastic tab of the top left."

    "text": "I'm new to BMWs so please correct any misunderstandings.The car has algorithms+sensors to determine its service needs. BMW's maintenance programs follow this and only this.i.e. If you want an oil change before the car indicates one is due, that's coming out of your pocket.(1) Does the car monitor the common replaceables: engine oil, brake fluid, brake pads, coolant, transmission fluid, diff fluid, air filter, belts, etc?(2) How do you reset the car's interval memory if service your own car?I assume you shouldn't reset while you're covered under BMW. If you do, it'll delay the service that the dealer was supposed to perform.(3) For the track drivers, does the car shorten the service intervals appropriately?A part of me says trust the engineers, another part says don't trust lawyers and actuaries.\n\nThey are at set intervals from what I can tell.  I have done 5 track days and a couple auto cross days with mine and it still has the same exact interval telling me to change my oil at the 10k mile mark.I just went ahead and changed my own oil and filter, brake fluid and pads by myself.  It's really not that bad to do any of it yourself.\n\n(3) Not really.  I change my oil every other track event, given all the stress, heat, and WOT.  Cheap insurance.  I change my 6MT fluid and diff fluid every year, or if several track events (6+) then I'll service sooner.If you're not tracking the car, my take is the fluid service intervals that are recommended are ok, w/exception of oil.  I service oil every 6-7,000 miles unless track days are involved - see above"

Now, other stuff may be \"better\" but if you ever have an engine issue under warranty, you want to be able to prove that you used what is required, to avoid a warranty claim denial."

The reason is that the cylinder walls will still be rough after machining and there may be burs that will fall off during break in so your oil will be very dirty.

I have put on 3,000km thus far, so I am well on the way of doing 35K km/year with it.Absolutely love the thing, but I noticed a little noise inside the cabin that appears to come from the engine. I hear it when I am lifting the clutch and the car gently starts to roll or when I am just driving low speed in first or second gear. It sounds a little like a chain/tensioner/rattle. When picking up speed the exhaust/ASD trumps it so I don't know if it's present then.Anybody know if this is normal? Factory warranty ends at the end of this month, so if something is up I would like to know beforehand. I want to ask owner's advice because Belgian dealers see 1 M2 for every 1000 of diesel cars. Therefore not really relying on their expert judgement if they send me home saying it's normal.\n\nNobody?\n\nI used to have this on my 435i.

It's a feature of the car.That being said, there are limitations to warranties. Under \"normal\" usage can be interpreted a number of ways, and there is definitely a threshold for abusive driving. For example, a tire may include a warranty up to a certain number of miles...but upon closer inspection of the car that warranty might be voided if the alignment was out of whack for an extended period of time, or you were roasting them in a parking lot doing burnouts and don"

Two weeks later, after disassembling most of interior, they found a shorted wire in wiring harness under passenger side seat .

I have the exact same problem with my 2015 335i. Along with the error messages, I lose power steering. The first time it happened was 3 weeks ago. Turned the engine off, then back on and the problem went away up until yesterday. Parked my car, went to Lowes and when I came back to the car and started it up, I got the problem again. Turned the engine off, then started it up and the problem went away momentarily, but came back after I pulled out of the stall. Did the same turn car off then back on with the same results for the next two attempts and got the same results (cleared errors only momentarily). Finally, after the forth attempt, the errors reset and I was able to drive the car home. My car is currently at the dealership. I am awaiting their update. Did you get any luck"

The air filter is included as part of the maintenance, which is rolled into the cost of the car. Just because it doesn't look dirty doesn't mean there aren't particulates trapped in it.Make them change that shit; if they don't want to change it, make them give you a new one and stash it away for once the car is out of warranty."

I'm relatively new to the BMW world but I can't imagine 1000 km's over the break in service is going to cause any damage as I'm sure the fluids from the factory can last a full service interval and it's possible there's some additives for break in that shouldn't do any harm if driven a little longer.  Just make an appointment with your local dealer to get this done as soon as they can.\n\nIt is very common. I purchased a CPO'd M4 with 11k and it never had the service recorded...so no one new if it had been done. I ran it hard up to 26k and all was fine.Check what the transferable coverage is on the 18's but the dealer might just do it anyways regardless"

A few months later I drove the car to the dealer for them to change some parts for me and with it they did the fix for the dash too. It's just a recode of the program, no part replacement. Not sure what happens when it dies though, as mine didn't."

If its the same price I don't see why it should be a problem.\n\nWhat makes you think that 40W is better than the generally BMW engineer recommended 30W oil?  Unless you are going pick something like a low viscosity 40W oil that is very close to a BMW 30W (which wouldn't be BMW oil) it is going to be thicker than BMW recommends and I would worry about long term reliability of all the engine valve train adjustments (e.g. vanos and valvetronic) that depend on proper oil viscosity to work properly.Maybe one of the oil gurus can weight in, but that is my take on 30 vs 40 weight oil.  I suppose if you are planning a lot of track time with the engine running at high temps, you could make an argument for the thicker oil as it may give some benefit in that situation, but nothing about your post suggests heavy track use.edit: did some research and the 40W may be among the recommended oils.  In that case, most of my argument is moot.  FWIW, there are a lot of engine oil threads findable with a quick search with far more knowledgable posts than mine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by2MGood question, I'd like to know as well.

    "text": "I have been getting this loud scraping noise whenever I start my car and make a tight right turn. What I have to point out is that this noise then tends to disappear as soon as the engine & the car gets warm.The scraping noise is a hollow, low noise that can be felt on the chassis itself when you're driving (mostly when you make right turns, it has now worsened and can be felt on the straights as well in some cases)  so it's definitely not the soda-crunch noise or anything like that. The car has 12,000 km.What blows my mind is that the noise disappears when the car gets warm and it only happens when the wheel is turned to the right. Still, it's a sickening sound to wake up to because you can feel that's something is scratching badly but I can't seem to find out what it is.I have taken it to the dealer where they replicated the noise but had no idea what can be causing the noise. Anyone experienced any similar issues?-- EDIT: RESOLVED --It was the new exhaust that was mounted in a incorrect way. Problem solved.\n\nOh and what makes it worse is that I live in a apartment complex and our underground 3-floor garage has only right turns. Hence, I can't get it out of my mind.Not the best way to start your mornings."

Hoping that will come back but who knows.Sounds like the tech had a fun time with your car\n\nMine has been a little notchy from pick up, after initial service and still is today. On following this forum for about a year after the initial release of the M2 , then receiving my car. Sounds like the little notchiness is a normal thing and I'm not concerned or bothered by it at all.Not sure why yours didn't do it prior to service, but I noticed it on mine. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad on mine, just something that is there. My prior car had a better shifter than the M2 but was a little notchy like the M2. Drove that car for 5 years with no trans issues at all.\n\nThanks for the replies, it seems to be going back to its buttery nature. I guess I need to drive it for a little."

I never heard of a manual transmission BMW that had a rev limited launch control like you explained.Maybe the M2 does the same thing.  I've never even thought to try it.\n\nI read about mt launch control on the 2 series forum. Tried it on my m2, and doesn't work. It'll rev to redline\n\nWith BM3 you can modify the maximum revs in neutral but Im not sure if you can manipulate the logic that determines if you want the limit.\n\nIt will definitely happen when they map it out properly, just like flat foot shifting, cold start delete, and all the other goodies that are generally available in the tuning market. This is pretty standard stuff.Also, its more than just beneficial for the massive turbos, it also just flat out results in better times. When all you have to do is floor it and release the clutch at the right time, it removes the extra movement to push the gas pedal. I know, it seems insignificant, but launch control and flat foot shifting is hands down faster for the vast majority of drivers that aren't launching their car every weekend at the strip to maintain muscle memory."

At first it happened once every few days but today I had to turn traction on and off 4-5 times to get it to make sexy sounds. The traction light comes on and idrive shows the change but no exhaust change. Anyone else run into this problem?I've also noticed a lag in the 1500-2000 RPM range in traction mode where the engine seems to hesitate before picking up again.

Mine is occasionally staying in \"comfort\" exhaust mode and requires turning traction on and off to get it back to burble mode. The throttle sensitivity and auto-rev match function haven't changed, as expected.With the lag, its under light acceleration, <50% throttle application, so I don't think its wheelspin or TC kicking in.\n\nMine does not do it all the time either.

The two brackets holding the stock (non MPE) mufflers to the subframe are fastened with flanged hex nuts that come loose/fall off.  I have 3800 miles on my M2 and the driver side nut came completely off last week, resulting in a loud knocking noise when up/down movement caused it to hit the body. The first pic is the driver side bolt from the frame without the nut.The 2nd pic is the passenger side bracket.  I checked to see if it was tight and, low and behold, it was definitely loose.So, the point is my particular car has an issue with these nuts coming loose and eventually falling off from vibration.  I got a replacement from the good folks at Advantage BMW Midtown Houston free of charge.  The factory nuts don't have any loctite or other locking mechanism on them at all, so my guess is more of use will start to see this issue over time.\n\nThanks for this tip.NOW will have to heat up the garage and go check.\n\ninteresting...... if i remember right my nuts have a mark across themSeriously I think they had been marked as torqued with a torque pen.

Fact is since the Chevy Cobalt debacle and punitive damages that were awarded the number of recalls initiated by manufacturers skyrocketed.  They are far better these days of monitoring the cars they have built for potential safety issues and addressing those issues early on versus the old days.  I would much rather get a recall notice and have to get a repair on something before there is a failure that could cause a safety or reliability problem.  The rear diff recall was a great example of this, the manufacture of that component proactively identified that they failed to use the right spec metal during a specific period of time and initiated a recall with BMW immediately.  Sure it was inconvenient but better than a diff failure in 5 years when your car isn't under warranty.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byscadagawdWas there an issue with the gauges?Here's the thread.

Well iv'e finally created an account and this is my first post.Last December, i put myself on the waiting list at Sylvania BMW (Sydney) for the M2. Literally, last December and it arrives in 2 or so weeks (already docked at Port Kembla). I'm upgrading from a Hyundai i30 (I know right, so much for baby steps). Great news is, it was an early July build, therefore an LCIEvery day, i have watched videos, reviews, read forums, etc.. I have only ever seen the M2 about 7-8 times on the road and yet to hear it roar (i have heard the Cold Start though - WOW!)The question that i have today - what's the overall driving experience like during the break-in? Will i still feel a fair bit of power? Looking for your experiences and answers, without the obvious \"It'll still be much quicker than the i30\"  I do drive my brother's Audi SQ5 a fair bit, however i know that this is quicker by about 1 second (which is heaps in car language)On another note - video's do no justice for volume. Is it really loud? And will i hear much of it during the break-in?Incase you're interested - Long Beach Blue, Sun-Roof, Heated Seats (no longer standard with the LCI)Thanks guys!\n\nCongratulation! I went through the same! Waited also about 8 months for my mineral grey and also read everything I could find about the M2, watched every video on YouTube etc.In terms of feeling the power during break in. Well I did it this way: the first 300km I really drove very smooth, especially let the breaks settle by not breaking too hard."

    "text": "about the M2, watched every video on YouTube etc.In terms of feeling the power during break in. Well I did it this way: the first 300km I really drove very smooth, especially let the breaks settle by not breaking too hard.After 600 or 700 i went above 3500 rpm, all very smooth, no quick acceleration, just let the motor get the revs without doing a kick down. And after 1000km I adjusted the rpm to the full break in amount of 5500. Still no hard breaking, vary the revs, shift a lot just to also break in every gear in the gearbox, though this oil won't be changed during break in service. Only motor and rear diff oil will be changed.Just before 2000km i nearly drove it as hard as normal but not over 5500rpm!You will hear the sound I promise although I got my M performance exhaust mounted just before delivery but when I test drove the M2 i loved the noise. This was actually the first car ever where I not only had a grin in my face when hearing the sound and especially the pops and cracks but also giggled like a school girl and laughed out loud because inhaftiert so much fun!Now when i heard that there is an exhaust that just deepens this experience i immediately had to order it and never looked back!It is so much more emotion and to me, worth every penny! Yes you have to cut the OEM exhaust, and yes there have been people that had the exhaust coming loose. I never experienced any of these flaws and the only thing I can report is that after 3000km i had to adjust the right side where it is mounted to the car because it got slightly unaligned. This can happen when something is getting that hot and I got it sorted in 5 minutes.Hope that helps to shorten your wait a bit!\n\nHuge congrats on the car and 1st post OP, good work.Power IMHO is honestly"

I never quite understand the question that keeps popping up. Launch control gets enabled and the oil gets changed, no magic +100HP. It's just that some follow run in and this keep the revs lower etc and thus it may seem a faster car than before.Don't forget plenty of pics once you have it\n\nWhat JustChris said and truth be told, just drive the damn thing,people go so cray cray about these first 1,200 miles. Don't.

A decent amount of old oil is left sitting there in the housing when you pull out the used element. I usually just soak it up with a couple disposable blue shop rags.

There is a creep feature meant for stop and go traffic where you tap on the gas and the car will creep forward without any additional gas so as not to wear on the clutch, I think it's just the tranny coming out of that mode.  My first DCT as well but it's known to be a little quirky at creep speeds from what I've read.\n\nHave not experience the whine but creeping forward is a pain in the ass.  My car fits in my garage with about 3\" to spare so I have to get the front bumper to within an inch or so of the wall.  I've got to creep up to the wall and spot the distance from the wall with with a mirror I have mounted on the side wall.  I'll be trying to creep up to it and with 3 or 4 inches to go, the DCT will just say this is good enough and stop.  I'm afraid to try to inch it forward so I end up backing up a foot or two and creeping in again.  I'm putting it down to not being used to it yet (only about 1400 miles on it) but maybe its something I'll just have to live with.  ...and before anyone jumps on, I still happy that I went DCT over stick! :-)\n\nWhen you're trying to creep in, don't use the gas pedal at all.  When you make it partway into the garage, stop entirely first. After you're stopped, give the gas a very light tap and take your foot off it right away (don't hold it). This will put the car into \"creep mode\" and that's the best way to make small adjustments (just use the brake to stop).\n\nAnd you can also use a wooden block under a front-wheel to get a consistent stopping point. My garage is pretty full with either a lawn tractor or snow-blower"

Will i still feel a fair bit of power? Looking for your experiences and answers, without the obvious \"It'll still be much quicker than the i30\"I do drive my brother's Audi SQ5 a fair bit, however i know that this is quicker by about 1 second (which is heaps in car language)On another note - video's do no justice for volume. Is it really loud? And will i hear much of it during the break-in?Incase you're interested - Long Beach Blue, Sun-Roof, Heated Seats (no longer standard with the LCI)Thanks guys!\n\ngo easy during the break in, follow the guidelines in the manual. the break in service does not change power or engine sound as far as I know.\n\nThere's plenty of power to be had under 5.5k.

The presenter correctly avoided comparing Group 3+ because most high performance oils contain them in some percentage as an additive carrier or as major component.#2.

(Unless the M2 CS comes in Manual)I was in Europe for 2 weeks. My path was Munich to pick up then went off to Monaco, Florence, Rome, Venice and back to Munich.I was told by the delivery specialist to have the service done at 1,200 miles and not to rev it past 5,500 and keep it under 110.Unfortunately, Every time I called a nearby dealership to do the service, they were booked for a couple of days. Also, I was unaware that June 15th-28th Germany was on Holidays.Long Story short, I couldn't do my service while I was there. I went over by 550 miles since the service was do. I never went over the revs or over the speed of 110.I emailed them my issue that the dealerships would no be able to service my car in the 2 days I stood in the cities. (That was my average in each city)How detrimental is this to my engine, transmission, and diff?My main concern is the warranty void.

I'm just a bit nervous. The good news is that I am getting it delivered on July 24th\n\nMy understanding is the original reason behind the 1,200 mile service is to remove all fluids containing metal from the initial contact between all the metal surfaces in the early part of break-in.  The oil and filter in the engine/transmission and the fluid in the diff keep these particles in suspension but you don't want to keep them in there for an extended time frame (5,000 or 10,000 miles until first oil change).Also, if BMW uses break-in oil (they might, but this is closely-held info) they'd want it out in relatively soon (1,200 miles).Finally, it appears there is software that is flashed upon the 1,200 mile mark...some parameters of the engine are changed prior/post 1,200 mile service.  I'm sure going over by a few hundred miles is no big deal.  The real intent is to have the early service performed at some point.\n\nIgnore the previous post.  There is no break in oil, there is no software change unless you have a DCT (launch control is activated). There is no metal floating around in a modern motor or trans.  Only the diff has a special break in oil so the"

The 406 Coupé had a two year / 20,000mile oil change interval, the S2000 on the other hand, which has a much more highly strung engine, had a one year / 7,500mile oil change interval.For the S2000, I bought my own oil, because Honda dealers weren't used to dealing with S2000s, and I felt that the standard oil might not be suitable, but I did stick to the intervals.I now have a 2012 Jaguar XF (5.0 V8), and I'd says its engine is somewhere in between the Peugeot and Honda in terms of tune. Its oil change interval is one year / 15,000mile.The M2 is a higher state of tune than the Jaguar, and I understand its oil change interval is one year / 10,000mile, which seems reasonable to me.Having said that, in the US, I hear of people changing oil as often as every 5,000miles, and there are plenty of small garages which specialise in only 'oil change for $50'.

My question is... who goes to those places?My wife has a 2016 Honda Pilot, which we've owned since new, and the local Honda dealer often sends me promotional emails offering reduced cost oil changes. Again, the car tells me when I need the oil change... why is the dealer offering this kind of service, and who does this?I only do about 7,500 miles / year, so I doubt I'm going to run into the milage requirement for oil changes in the M2, but I'm starting to wonder if I need to change the oil twice / year, or at 5,000 miles?Anyone have any thoughts on this?\n\nBMW recommend a 2-year/25,000km change for Australian M2s. They also specify an annual Vehicle Inspection so I will have the oil changed once a year at that point.\n\nIf you are keeping the car for 10years +, then it may be worth doing intermediate changes but this is entirely dependent on many factors, how often you drive, how hard you drive, start stop driving, what the environmental conditions are like etc etc.I read an article, I think it was castrol, where they carried out  some real world testing on their oil, they left the oil in an engine for 1 year and 15000 mile, then they when removed oil and stripped the engine. They found that the tolerances were factory spec and oil quality was also.I will personally stick to the interval BMW set as I believe they know more than me on this subject and the last thing they want is engine failures or blown turbos,  it's bad press and would cause them a fortune.If you track the car or drive really hard then it could be worth it but again the"

    "text": "After researching a few weeks back I now have a W37 allocation, with what seems to be the popular LBB, Executive Package, 6MT, Apple Car Play configuration.I've now got the agonising wait until mid-November when it arrives, but that does give me time to think about some of the options that I might want, and also to think about extended warranty and servicing options.One of the reasons that I'm planning on changing cars to the M2 is that my current car, a 2012 Jaguar XF Portfolio Sport (NA 5.0 V8) is out of warranty and included service plan, and it's started to really be quite expensive to maintain. Nothing has gone wrong with it yet, and it's even still on the original tyres and brakes, but the last service, which was just oil change,filters and checking stuff, cost $1,800 and the next one I've been told will be $2,200!When the Jaguar inclusive servicing ended, they did offer an extended service / warranty package, which I declined, because it was $4,000 if I remember correctly. Now that cost doesn't seem as extreme, but I'm anyway hoping the M2 will be slightly cheaper, and want to think about the most cost effective way to plan for servicing over the course of ownership.Looking at theBMW USA service page about Ultimate Care, I put in the details of a 2018 M2 with 10 miles on the clock assuming a start date of today, and got the following costs out for Ultimate Care+, which covers warranty and servicing, including wear and tear items (I think):3 years / 36,000 miles - $6004 years / 50,000 miles - $1,3495 years / 75,000 miles - $2,3496 years / 100,000 miles - $3,4997 years / 125,000 miles - $4,549The first thing that I noticed about this, is that the"

There is a tag line which states\"PURCHASE ULTIMATE CARE+ AND AN EXTENTION PRODUCT WITHIN 90 DAYS OF VEHICLE IN SERVICE DATE AND RECEIVE $100 OFF.\", so perhaps the costs I bulleted above include this discount!?!The other thing I noticed is the explanation that shows\"As an owner or lessee of a new BMW, you can decide to add this coverage at any point before your BMW reaches the end of its current coverage.\", so the Ultimate Care+ extensions can be added any time until 3 years after you buy the car!I'm not convinced that I'll use up brake pads / wiper blades / clutch in the first 3 years, but I might in the future, so I probably won't be getting the Ultimate Care+ $600 addition initially, but may very well opt for the additional few years once I know if I'll be keeping the car beyond 3 years.What are others doing with this?\n\ni just took delivery of mine 3 weeks ago from stevens creek in santa clara.  i originally signed for the 5YR/75K which they gave me for $2749. after much consideration, i called the next day to cancel.  ill re-assess when i get close to the 3yr date.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydaftshami just took delivery of mine 3 weeks ago from stevens creek in santa clara.  i originally signed for the 5YR/75K which they"

They say not to exceed a speed to keep heat down as the thicker break-in oil likely doesn't lubricate good enough above that speed!  I would not exceed the speed.

Blue Ridge Parkway, 421 The Snake, Diamondback, Etc.How do I need to limit my driving with this engine?  How many miles?Thanks in advance....Interesting that I have not seen one person discuss the manual's reference to 1200 to 3100 miles and what to do.  The car is not fully broken in at 1200 mi/2000 km.\n\nI read that fully, and if anything have taken it fairly conservative so far up to 997 miles as of yesterday and will do the same over the next break-in range. On bedding brakes, I normally will do a few higher speed stops with constant pressure and then completely let off not holding the pedal down of course. Then drive away as usual. I did this after the first couple hundred miles in which I did the same but at lower speeds. Biggest mistake seems to be inexperienced drivers braking late and hard and then hold the pedal down, hence warped rotors etc...again, just use common senses. Love the brakes on this car, but then again I haven't had it on the track with prolonged hard braking sessions.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydoug_999Just going off everything I have read over the years - here are two I just found.https://www.tirerack.com/brakes/tech....jsp?techid=85https://ebcbrakes.com/articles/bedding-in/Hey, thanks"

How come it doesn't say anything about the 200km rule in my paperwork?\n\nI think you want to get rid of the break-in specific oils (engine and diff) and also remove whatever metal has built up in the oil and filter.

I believe our flywheel is pretty light for a dual mass, when my car is warm I can hear it really well, I enjoy it though. It's not aluminum single mass/blow your brains out loud.And at certain times I can here a little metallic rattle up front, from the belt assembly, not nearly as loud as that but I've heard it. Along with upper engine noise from our light as hell 0w30. When I switch to ester based 5w30-40 redline oil Euro mix the car is much quieter. That weight shears like a 5w40, it's awesome.

I'm sure 300v is even better.\n\nThanks for the suggestions and comments guys, I'm convinced it's related to the belt drive system. My best bet is to make my own journal and request the dealership make record of my concerns & request detailed copies.  I'm known already for being that neurotic PITA customer because I called ahead to my S/A requesting a \"Top Tech\" for my 1st service.

This is the second BMW I've had this happen to, it's sooooo annoying!!!I've tried to book the car in the dealer and it's 3 weeks. Does anyone know the exact location of the horns? Can they be accessed through the wheel arch or is it a bumper-off job Alternatively is there a fuse/relay?I wouldn't mind just taking a quick look myself (I'm an engineer) as it's most likely just a loose connection or something. I have recently fitted my black grilles - not sure if this is related when moving the top of the bumper around - it would depend on where they are I suppose.\n\nNot sure the location but looking at Realoem.com they show that there are two horns, a low pitch and a high pitch.  Sounds like one of yours is not working.  I wouldn't worry about it and let the dealer fix it personally but perhaps you Brits are like New Yorkers and don't use turn signals because your too busy laying on the horn :-).  It is also interesting to see they have several horn configurations based on country and even have a hot climate version.  Nothing like governments regulating everything to make life more complicated.\n\nActually, the horn stuff is often due to \"regional preferences\" from what I've read.  In the US at least, I don't know that there is much in the way of horn regulation other than probably a maximum decibel rating and probably a suggested range of tones...\n\nThanks guys, I managed to get a slot yesterday morning and they replaced it for me, 1/2hr job.I must say, annoying as it was on a new car - it was damn hilarious!!And yes, us brits (especially BMW drivers!) spend a lot of time on the horn"

About 1 week ago it only turned on randomly while driving not immediately when I started driving away after turning the car on like it does now.Another thing to mention is that from what I feel so far it does not affect anything at all performance wise or suspension wise. The car still feels exactly how it did before the malfunction.I am pretty heavily modified. BM3 tune, catless dp, FMIC, MPE, Chargepipes, Aquamist Meth Kit, Eventuri Intake, Ohlin Coilovers. This malfunction happened on its own out of no where. I've had all of these mods installed for some time now with no issues whatsoever. So before I have to take almost everything off and go to the dealer I want to know if anyone here has any experience or insight as to what this could be. I'm a 2016 car with DCT. I know there were some recalls on the differentials but when I had my car for the first 4-5 months I called the dealer numerous times and they checked many times for me to see if my car was under the recall for the differentials and they were adamant about it not being affected by it. So I asked one of my buddies who was a bmw tech and he said it could very well just be a sensor or harness that got messed up; He said he's seen that many times and it just was a sensor or something similar usually.I don't want to take the chance and leave it like this much longer so I'm planning to flash back to stock and hit the dealer next week in hopes of them fixing it under warranty.Anyone have any ideas or clues??

For most brands, premium has typically cost 40 cents more that regular (20 cents over mid-grade), at least in my area. I noticed this past weekend my local station is now charging a 95 cent premium. Since I can afford an M2 and the cost to maintain it, it's not that i can't pay it, I just feel like their gouging their customers. I did report it on the Shell web site, but I expect them to say their dealers are independent and are free to charge 'whatever the market will bear'. BTW, if you sign up on their web site, you can get a 3 cent per gallon reduction.Anyone else notice significant Shell price increases?What are your experiences with Sunoco super premium?.\n\nSummer formula change? They do that in Chicago as a reason to charge more. They make the switch when it gets warmer.\n\nCostco Gasoline\n\nHere in Chicago, Premium gas has been a dollar more than regular for years now. It's not only Shell, it's every gas station here in chicago. Unless you go to a Costco or Sams Club. The cheapest Shell I have found in Chicagoland area is 70 cents more for premium. I trust Shell the most, so I always fill up there.But I do remember when it used to be only 30 cents more. If you ask me, there's definitely some type of corruption going on. They're charging more for premium gas (more expensive cars, more wealthy people).\n\nSomeone will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe everyone is using the same gas in your region.

The change  in maintenance is a real consideration factor moving to 2017 models and beyond.\n\nBut, are the brake pads and rotors expected to wear out before 50k for average M2 driver?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byzenmasterBut, are the brake pads and rotors expected to wear out before 50k for average M2 driver?No. But many owners will attempt to get them replaced before the warranty is out. 3-4 years of regular driving at 15-18K miles a year sounds about"

    "text": "I am buying a new 2017 m2. I am debating about buying the maintenance options. I owned a 2011 e92 m3 and drove it for 6 years putting 50,000 miles on the car. I never needed breaks. And most of the maintanence was basic things like oil changes, transmission fluid, differential fluid etc.I will out about 6000 miles per year on the car and won't drive in winter. I think the main difference between the new and old maintanence program is brakes, clutch for manual cars, wiper blades, and a few other things. All the basic fluid services are included.Should I pony up the $600 or the $1800 to turn it into what it was before for 4 years? If the brakes are as good as my e92 m3 I don't think I will need brakes during the first 4 years of ownership. That was the main selling point by the dealer.\n\nI have the extended maintenance on my 2014 335i but declinded for the M2. I've come to realize I don't like being locked into the dealers schedule and what the dealer thinks I need. Obviously, they have more expertise than I do, but I'd rather have the flexibility to do things on my schedule. Also, I don't like the worry that I won't get my money's worth if I get rid of the car early or if I don't meet criteria for a bigger item like brakes.Another quick example: I had a nail in a tire and my low oil light had just come on. I was 50 miles away from being eligible for service (2050 miles on maintenance minder). I asked if they would do the maintenance while I was there for the tire and low oil, and initially, they said they couldn't because it wasn't due according to maintenance plan.

This statement sounds weird to me.a 0w is for -20c. unless you live in a climate that sees -20c on a daily basis, its not necessary.I have heard this statement hundreds of times, that 0w40 is the same as 5w40 at operating temperature. there is no magical chemistry at play here, physically THINNER oil cannot provide the same bearing protection as a physically THICKER 5W. 0w oils shear quicker, this is a proven fact. in my owner manual is says that 5w30/5w40 is suitable for all weather conditions why would one use anything else?a 5w will fill your bearings better and stand up to high temperatures more effectively. I have tried both and the 5w not only runs at lower temperatures, but quiets your drivetrain both at operating temps AND warm starts.the 0w nonsense is a myth started by the north american CAFE requirements in a desperate attempt to see 0.2MPG fuel economy gains per car.do you live in a climate that constantly sees -20c temperatures? most likely not. so why use a 0w? even russia with their frigid temperatures still spec a 5w30 for all of their cars.on a side note, I have just switched to shell rotella t6 for my N52 engine and this stuff is incredible for a 5w40 on cold starts.

As lifetime oil was used.\n\nHave you ever considered that the normal operating temp on an N55 / N55 Variant is on average 228-238F pending on outside air temps and driving style.  (My observations on my N55).Oil viscosity temps are taken at 100C or 212 F.    So at 212 F the oil (30wt) is up to 12.5cst thick (max for any 30wt oil)  however, your car sees 228 - 238 F just driving around town on a 50F day.    Now that same oil at 230 F --  gets almost as thin as a 20wt oil and at 240F (summer driving) the oil has a hard time providing the film and bearing strength to keep your car protected.   Plus you have a car that is Direct Injected where fuel dilution can further lower the viscosity..So - for winter the 0W-30 may be the right oil -- but a 40WT just may be the better choice for summer.   I am thinking 0W-40 or 5W-40 year around depending on where you live unless fuel economy is a top criteria.A 12cst thick oil at operating temp"

BMW/MINI are on a crusade to reduce the amount of services a vehicle needs in its lifetime/100k miles. It's in their interest to convince you of the idea of 'lifetime' oils. As such they will never cover lifetime items under warranty or service plans.That said, I've build more than a few engines and gearboxes and I do not believe in such mystical things as service free gearbox/fuel filter/engine oil.It's entirely your call but my dealer charged me £48 for the gearbox oil - but I missed a gear change while being a little to enthusiasticWho wants small pieces of metal in their gearbox oils for 100k miles?I drive my cars HARD so change my fluids every 8k rather than the 16k on the service plan. If you've only going to keep it three years rag the fuck out of it, do hard pulls and let the other guy worry about it post warranty. If you have even the slightest inclination to keep it my vote is"

If you have even the slightest inclination to keep it my vote is to look after it.\n\nWord of warning to DCT owners and MT owners.I don't suggest you adhere to the BS of \"lifetime\" fluids. I had an E46 automatic that also had a \"lifetime\" transmission fluid. At around 90k miles, sure enough the valve body went out (I couldnt go into reverse gear, made parking very interesting), shops were quoting $2500 for the repair. Luckily I found a shop in Florida that rebuilt the valve bodies for $600 + your core. I did the repair myself, it was pretty easy.Moral of this story is I'll be changing my transmission fluids around 50k miles on my own dime. If you think it is a difficult procedure, I'd suggest you pay the dealership to do it.\n\nI think the guy who writes Tech Talk for Roundel, and the guy who used to write for Bimmer, say that \"lifetime fill\" is bs.  I pay no attention to BMW recommendations for long change intervals.  The worst I am doing is dropping a little unnecessary dough.  The best is far better than that.\n\nI plan to get transmission oil changed on my MT at the 1200 mile service. Should I tell them not to reset the service interval after completion?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCommitConfirmBMW"

(Storage will just be a non-heated garage and I may still drive on nice days this winter.)The only minor issues I have had are the tire pressure on my rear passenger tire (which I unfortunately had to replace after like 2 weeks because I got a flat; I have just filled it back up when low and it has been fine for a few weeks at a time but it seems like could be a slow leak?) and an intermittent message that pops up about automatic high beams not functioning correctly (I have never noticed any actual issue).Any thoughts would be appreciated.Thanks.\n\nIt's probably better to change the oil after storage. All the particles will sediment in the oil tank and will pass via the filter. A new oil/filter change will be better in the spring and you will use the oil (oil has a life limit as it oxides).Hope it helps!\n\nMakes sense.  Thanks for the reply.\n\nYou'll be fine changing the oil in the spring.  If it's going to be sitting awhile, throw some Startron in a full tank of gas and over inflate you tires.  If the rear tire is leaking air, have your tire shop remount it.\n\nWith conventional oils the recommendation for storage was always to change the oil before because byproducts"

    "text": "Has anyone had any weird happenings with the electricals? I just posted in another thread that my BMW Assist isn't working and the car is going to the dealer tomorrow for that.More concerning to me, and possibly related but likely not, I'm also having a couple of weird electrical issues. First I noticed last night that after I shut off the car and locked it, all of the interior lights go out, except the hazard button, start/stop button, and headlight switch all stayed illuminated. The hazard button turned off within a minute or two, but the others stayed on longer. They turned off eventually but I don't know how long it took - I got tired of waiting. That's recurred every time I've shut down since.Second, this morning my turn signals started acting like a bulb was out. Flip on the signal and it's normal for several seconds, then the rear signal goes out and the others go into the double-time flash. The weird thing (to me anyway) is that this happened on BOTH sides of the car. Maybe a faulty switch? I have to admit that once I checked the rear signals and they went out I didn't check the fronts. The mirror indicators were still lighting up.Frankly I'm pretty terrified that I'm already having seemingly unrelated electrical issues on a brand new car - I've had it for 5 days. I plan on keeping this car for a long time, and the last thing I want is to be constantly chasing gremlins. The dealer will also be checking this out tomorrow but was curious if anyone had any thoughts or similar experiences."

Ok but what's difference between LL01 or LL04?!?Now, my local dealer recommends 5w30, but I'm considering to either continue with 0w30 or go with that new BMW Oil that they recommend for M2 which 0w40 !?What are general benefits and cons between these too, and if someone switched from 0w30 to 0w40 what's your experience so far?Thanks everyone!\n\nI just put 1l in at 7502miles miles\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bykiysersosaeI just put 1l in at"

I used 5w 30 in 1m but I had to replace every 1500miles. With Mobil 1 driven the same way, including a track session for 2hrs,  it's not lost a drop.  I've yet to drive the m2 long distance, track and road but all my cars run Mobil 0w 40, which everyone says is almost like a 0w  30, and I've had no issues."

Gear oil is inexpensive, just drain and fill.\n\nJust got my m2 yesterday, the dealership told me to have a service after the 2000km mark.
