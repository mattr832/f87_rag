Changing it more often is just a waste of time.If you have BMW Connect active your cell phone has the mileage or dates when all recommended service is due.

Heat cycling to 270*F will degrade your synthetic oil.You do whatever you want, but if you take a look at every performance shop analyzing why bmws break down so much more frequently compared to other brands it is attributed to infrequent maintenance such as oil changes, fluid swaps, and using crappy parts like chinese oil filter elements.\n\nThey are still fully synthetic and not subject to contamination by combustion products so won't degrade at a significant rate. If you're subjecting the transmission to heavy use you want the fluid to trap the wear products and hence it's a good idea to change the fluid more frequently.But otherwise in normal use they are good for more than the 2 years of a non Life Time Fill fluid.As I mentioned elsewhere, I changed the Life Time Fill fluid on my superannuated E46 at 150k miles and it made a significant difference to shift quality (the colour of the stuff that came out was soot black), but it was still working - and continues to do so some 5 years and 30k miles later using just regular MTF fluid changed every couple of years.Once more, HTH.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDanGDiff and transmission fluids are considered lifetime fluids.

I will also go over the particular use cases and benefits of this jack stand and why I think they make this jack stand one of the best if not the best jack stands on the market. I will also compare these jack stands to other alternatives like ramps and the quick jacks, and contrast and compare the pros and cons of these alternatives. I will also go over the BMW Jack pad adapter for the Rennstands as well.So if you are interested in purchasing the Rennstands heres are some links to do so:Rennstand:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ece-p252276669BMW Jack Pad adapter:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p255054561Disclaimer:Damage/Injury Disclaimer: Any information, guidance, technical advice, coding advice, tuning advice, datalogging advice, installation instruction, calculation, experiment, safety information, or product installation demonstrated in my reviews is to be consumed/read/understood/followed and or done at your own risk. I will not be responsible/held liable for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Monetary disclaimer: I do not make commission, or profits or any kind of monetary gain from the sale of the Rennstand or the BMW Jack Pad adapter for the Rennstand.Sponsorship disclaimer: The way my reviews work is that I determine what product that I want to buy and actually use on my own car, and during this process the product that I end up choosing is what I believe is the best option on the market. I then reach out to the company offering the product and ask them if they would be willing to sponsor me in a review, if the answer is yes then I write a review, if the answer is no I would end up buying the product (sometimes at a later date) but I wouldnt complete a detailed review about it (I might write something, but not to the same extent as my standard reviews). But the critical thing is that I reach out for a sponsorship and not the other way around, this means that the products I am reviewing are actually things I believe in and would use on my own car. This also means that I am not being paid to review something I do not care about. Would I do a review if a sponsor reached out to me? The answer would depend on if I believed in the product, and I would make it clear in my review if this were the case. But at the time of writing this review, such an interaction has not occurred yet.Time of writing disclaimer: everything I am writing about in this review is described at the time of writing and may not be updated in the future, so there is a potential that things are no longer accurate in my comparisons as parts are changed and upgraded as time passes.Bias and comparison disclaimer: Throughout this review I will attempt to be as unbiased as possible while drawing comparisons to other products.Mistakes and Inaccuracies Disclaimer: Throughout my review I will try to be as factually accurate as possible, but there are always chances that I make mistakes and write things that are incorrect/false. If this is the case please point it out to me and if indeed it is true that I am incorrect, I will correct these mistakes and apologize for them. Afterall I am only human, so mistakes can and will inevitably happen.Subjective Disclaimer: Please note, these reviews are also written in my own opinion, so when I am comparing different products to determine what I see as the best, there are many factors that I go through to form this opinion. Obviously there will be disagreements between people, so I will do my best to objectively determine what I deem to be the best, but at the end of the day it is still just my own opinion whether it be right or wrong. Take whatever I say in my reviews with a grain of salt.Information Disclaimer: I read a lot of material over the years just out of sheer interest or to make these reviews. I also accumulated a lot of knowledge over my many years of education that are really relevant to cars (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics). That being said, my reviews are mostly based on this accumulated knowledge and I cannot always cite these sources due to the original source material possibly being lost to time, or there being so much knowledge compiled to make a single point. So, when possible I will cite my source(s) (for example data on tensile strength of a metal, or peer reviewed research). There are cases when I get information from blog posts, youtube videos, or forum posts I may not cite it, because I go through a lot of these sources only to use the gained knowledge in a small section of my review and it is not feasible to list them all. So pretty much what I am trying to say is I am not citing common knowledge - I will cite peer reviewed research and photos though (if applicable or used), or really explicit user experiences (if applicable or used).Image Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the respective image owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.Review Disclaimer:First and foremost I would like to thank ETA MFG for agreeing to sponsor me for this review. Despite this I will remain as unbiased as possible during the review. Please note, the dynamics of this relationship was that I reached out for a sponsorship review and not the other way around. This should demonstrate how I truly feel about the Rennstand - in the sense that I truly believe it is the best jack stand on the market, and a suitable alternative to the quick jacks. In fact I actually I am actually using these Rennstands to install all of my mods and do all of my services in 2024, and I likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.What Are Rennstands, and who makes them?:So lets begin by discussing what are Rennstands? The best answer to that revolves around Rennstands own motto: One Jack, One Jack Point, Rennstand - essentially Rennstands are jack stands that can be disassembled and used to lift a car at a specific jacking point, then once the car is lifted the Rennstand can be reassembled and left there while the jack is removed. The end result is a jack stand that can support the car right at the point it is lifted from - meaning you no longer have to jack the car up at the jacking point and look for a suitable place on the chassis to leave a jack stand (not always suitable on cars with alot of underbody panels - such as BMWs). This is also the most optimal and ideal place to put a jack stand, since vehicles are technically only meant to be lifted and supported at the jacking point - and manufacturers did not intend to have the car lifted by a jack and supported elsewhere by a jack stand. Manufacturers only really intended for cars to be worked on via post based lifts (the stuff you would find in a shop) which lifts and supports the car right at the jacking point, and thus the Rennstands are really the only jack stands on the market that can fulfill this requirement (every other jack stand requires you to jack on the jacking point and shove the jack stand somewhere on the frame).Heres a video briefly going over using the Rennstand itself:Next I would like to discuss who makes the Rennstands, because as you may have noticed there seems to be a lot of different vendors and variants out there.So, the Rennstands were actually created by Frank Ceravolo a Porsche owner on Rennlist (username: gyrfalcon) in mid 2016 with the goal of trying to create a jack stand that could be placed exactly where the vehicle manufacturer intended for the car to be supported - i.e. the jacking point and not on some random part of the frame. His goal was also to make the Rennstands light weight, extremely compact, easily transportable, height adjustable and low profile to fit under really low cars. After creating this initial design, Frank had his design rigorously tested by an engineer at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University for strength and durability. After the designs were tested he was able to obtain patents protecting the design.Now fast forward to production and these patents were licensed out to various vendors to facilitate production and sale of the Rennstand and thats why you may have seen several different vendors selling the Rennstand. Initially they were made by safe jack - but they are no longer selling or making the Rennstand, now Rennstand Inc (I think this is Franks company - but I am not sure) is currently manufacturing (made in the USA) and selling the original design of the Rennstand along with ETA MFG who are manufacturing (made in China) and selling what they call Rennstand 2.0 (under licensing from Frank) which is a modified version of the Rennstand (and imo an improved/better version that fixes some of the gripes I had with the original one - and I will explain why later on). So that basically sums up the history of the Rennstand and who is authorized to sell a legit version of the Rennstand (currently it is ETA MFG with Rennstand 2.0 and Rennstand Inc with the original Rennstand) - that has been engineered and tested to be safe, unlike any knock offs you may find online.If you want to see some sources here are the links:Heres Franks initial thread:https://rennlist.com/forums/993-foru...-new-idea.htmlHeres Franks first intro thread :https://rennlist.com/forums/987-foru...che-owner.htmlHeres ETA MFGs thread talking about Rennstand 2.0:https://www.etamfg.com/rennstand-ii.htmlAlso I wanted to include a small excerpt about who ETA MFG are - because if you judge them by their website and not go in depth reading about them you may not get the full picture of exactly who these people are and might not feel reassured buying their products (I have heard people say who are these guys, why buy the Rennstand from them they didnt even design it so why trust them to make it etc). Well ETA MFG is actually a manufacturing powerhouse with a factory spanning 1.6 million SF built-up structure on a 50 acre campus, and they specialize in manufacturing private label products for the global market. So pretty much you design it, they will manufacture it for you. But in the case of the Rennstand and the Mylift stand, they not only manufacture it but they resell it for you as well.Traditional Jack Stands:Credit: Canadian Tirehttps://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/m...jack+stand#srpNext lets talk about traditional jack stands. Now I have nothing against traditional jack stands, they serve their purpose well and are very safe for use on vehicles with large tubular frames or pinch welds that can be used to support the weight of a vehicle. Plus they are cheap, easy to use, portable and easy to store since they are so small. However on modern day BMWs I personally think jack stands with the claw style saddle are absolutely horrible - and lets talk about why.Credit: KC Designhttps://www.tw-kcdesign.com/upload/i...3%E5%9C%96.jpgThe first issue is placement (as you can see above this is an underbody image of the F87 M2 (representative of the F8X Chassis) and the F2X M235i (representative of the F2X and F3X chassis)):On the rear of the F8X chassis you could put the jack stands on the rear subframe, but there arent any good areas at the front of the car given you use the jacking points to lift the car. You obviously cant put jack stands on the suspension arms (tension arm, lower control arm, thrust arm) as they arent made to take weight and you risk damaging them. You cant put jack stands on the stiffening plate as that might need to be removed and its a weird flat shape which isnt a super good place to put a claw style jack stand (or you might have to remove the plate entirely for servicing), and obviously you cant put it on the floor panels as itll punch straight through and damage the sheet metal underneath. So there really isnt any good place to put jack stands on the F8X except the rear subframe. On the F22 since the rear subframe isnt as aggressive as on the F8X it becomes even more difficult to place jack stands.Credit: .Slughttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1854652The next issue is with the claw style design:Now if you wanted to place the jack stands on the jacking points youd need a flat top jack stand like ESCO in conjunction with aluminum jack pad adapters, because placing traditional claw style jack stands under the plastic jacking points will cause them to break over time - plus the plastic was not meant to bear weight so you also risk the car collapsing if the plastic fails. Traditional claw style jack stands also dont have a large enough surface area to hold a jack pad adapter in a stable configuration, so you risk it slipping off if you try to stack a jack pad adapter onto the claw.Credit: chiefsubjugatorhttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...6&postcount=32The final issue is choosing a location to jack from - and this applies to all jack stands:Youd also need to jack from the front and the rear center jack points, on an F2X and F3X vehicle you can do so fairly stably via the front center jack point and the rear differential. On an F8X vehicle you can jack the front up via the front center jack point without issue, but the rear must be jacked up using the rear subframe. Now this poses a bit of risk because the central part of the rear subframe is extremely close to the differential meaning only a small part of the jacks saddle can make contact with the subframe so it is very risky as the car can slip off the jack (as you can see in the image above). You can choose to jack from the side protrusion on the rear subframe, but that can pose instability issues as you try to lift the entire rear end of the car up while being closer to one side vs. the other.Now something I did not mention is jacking from the front center jack point is a massive pain, since the front center jack point is so deep under the car you require a special lower profile extended length jack - otherwise you will need to first jack/drive the car onto blocks of wood for additional clearance. Then the next issue is pumping the car up, since the clearance between the front bumper and the floor is so small your jack handle literally can only move inches at a time, and it takes forever to jack the car up from the front center jack point and this is a major pain to deal with.Overall the cons of jack stands revolve around placement, compatibility with the factory jacking point, and time consuming and tedious nature to lift the car up onto said jack stands.Ramps:Credit: F87SourceNow lets quickly talk about Ramps - this is another traditional way to raise the car up to a working height. This personally was my favorite method of working on my m2 (until the Rennstand) - due to its unparalleled stability (since the car is sitting on 4 massive contact patches and due to the fact that cars were designed to sit on their wheels for the life of the car), extreme affordability (Rhino ramps are extremely cheap), and due to their weight build and ability to be stacked - they are very easy to store. Ramps also allow for realistic suspension tuning by putting preload on the suspension - something quick jacks or jack stands cannot do. So these are all the reasons why I loved my ramps, however there are still massive flaws, so lets talk about them.The first issue is lifting the car:Most ramps are way too tall for the more sporty models of BMW to just drive up on, especially when you want all 4 wheels to go up at the same time - meaning the rear ramps have to already be underneath the car for you to drive up onto them at the same time as the front ramps. This means your only option is to jack the car up onto the ramps (the exceptions are race ramps but they are quite expensive, and for the price you might as well just buy Rennstands). Now the issue with jacking the car up onto Ramps is that you need 2 jacks - one for each side of the car so you can raise the car onto the ramps in a level manner. This is a massively time consuming process as you have to pump one side of the car up little by little to ensure it doesnt flip, and if one of your jacks are too short (like mine is in the image above) you need to prop it up on 2 by fours and move all that wood to the next wheel along with your jack. It is also extremely risky and dangerous, because the front wheels on RWD BMWs do not have any parking brakes. This means when you have to jack the rear of the car up on ramps first as you can still chock the front wheels while theyre on the ground, and the rear wheels are safe to be on the ramps first as they have parking brakes. Then you have to carefully jack the front wheels up on ramps afterwards. To make this process safer you should get a brake pedal depressor tool like I have. But this is still extremely tedious and time consuming.The second issue is you cant do anything that requires the wheels to be off:This means if you need to do brake jobs, wheel rotations etc. Your ramps are completely and utterly useless - which is why I wanted to upgrade to Rennstands for my primary mode of supporting the car, and have the ramps for suspension tuning.The final issue is adjustability:The final issue with ramps is the lack of adjustability, ramps are one height and thats it. You cant go lower and you cant go higher, and that is an annoyance if you want to work in the engine bay while it is on ramps. It becomes a bit of a challenge to reach deep down into the engine bay when the car is high up.So these are the reasons why ramps are not completely ideal for working on your car.Quick Jacks:Credit: Driver87https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...95&postcount=9Finally I want to talk about the Quick jacks. These are very very nice pieces of equipment, they allow for the car to be lifted via the press of a button - so no more pumping up jacks. They lift front and rear and left and right simultaneously so it is one and done, no need to worry about the front and then the rear and vice versa. The quick jacks also allow for a 24 lift height which surpasses all jack stands and ramps by quite a big margin iirc. But there are always drawbacks to everything, so lets talk about it.The first issue is price:Quick jacks are insanely expensive, they retail for $1500 USD + (and that's for the cheapest model). For that price you can buy ~3 sets of Rennstands, ~15 pairs for Rhino ramps, and ~30+ pairs of conventional jack stands. So it is not cheap and thats always a huge drawback for a lot of people, since it becomes a money issue. Now before I hear you own a BMW you should be able to afford quick jacks, dont forget these cars are rapidly becoming older and more accessible to more and more people, so money is always going to become a factor eventually. Plus its a BMW, theyre relatively affordable for sports car sake.The second issue is Size:Quick jacks are quite large at 60 +, and quite heavy at 60 lbs + for the frame itself and 15 lbs for the motor. So this makes portability and setup a concern, so if you have a small garage or a space constrained garage storing these quick jacks and setting them up and taking them down to store some place else might become tiresome as they are heavy and bulky. This is one of the main restricting factor for myself, since my garage is full of stuff and I dont have room for quick jacks (I have 3 cars in my garage, bikes, a lawn mower, snow blower, leaf blower, tools, air compressor, etc - so unfortunately there is no room for quick jacks in my garage). This is an even larger issue if you live in a house without a garage (apartment, condo, townhouse etc) and you cant constantly carry the quick jack into and out of your house. For most people the size and weight are deal breakers, and this unfortunately is my issue.The Final issue is maintenance:Like with most hydraulic power tools you have to maintain them to ensure they work properly. You have to ensure that the quick jack frames stay clean, you have to ensure the hoses and quick disconnect fittings stay clean, and you always have to watch for leaks and inspect the locking system. You also have to bleed the system occasionally.So this is a minor hassle that must be dealt with, and doesnt make the quick jack a true set it and forget it system (unlike mechanical systems like ramps or jack stands) and this might be annoying to some.Rennstands:Now onto my discussion of the Rennstands.Unboxing:First let's start off with the unboxing so you guys will have an idea of what you are going to get, since I dont see too many unboxings of the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo the first 3 images show the box that each individual Rennstand comes in, and they are actually really small overall (even smaller than a pizza box but just a bit thicker), however each box is quite heavy at ~25 pounds. The ETA MFG box itself was also double boxed and contained within the outer USPS box.ETA MFG also have duty free shipping to Canada and the USA so if you are in those locations, you will be glad to hear it will arrive to you without the worry of paying duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (and take it from me a guy who buys a lot of stuff from the US, brokerage fees from UPS often cost 2-3x as much as the shipping itself and that really sucks). My package was also shipped via Canada post, and arrived to me in ~4 business days, which is absolutely excellent, and the package arrived as if it were brand new so shipping was good and packaging was excellent.Credit: F87SourceThe next image shows the Rennstand box opened up, you will notice it is packaged excellently - I cant even begin to describe how good this packaging was - it must be the best packaged item I have ever purchased in terms of car parts. Now let me explain, the box itself has a wooden frame going around its circumference, this prevents the heavy weight from collapsing the box and prevents the box from being dented in and damaging the Rennstands. Next each item in the box was individually bagged, and parts that would touch were covered in cardboard, there was also a wooden divider separating the solid metal kegs from the rest of the box to prevent damage. Loose items like the pins were put in a bag (the pin one to the right of the image) and wrapped with foam and then tied down. Also critical voids in the box were filled with styrofoam or cardboard, and as a result there were ZERO rattles or movement in the packaging and that meant the Rennstands arrived in essentially excellent condition. So props to ETA MFG on packaging - I am thoroughly impressed. The only con was how long it took to unpack everything haha, but better that than having all of my stuff arrive damaged.Credit: F87SourceSo in this image above you will see everything in the box laid out: Feet, legs, saddle, jack pad, and pins.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNext are images of the Orange feet that these Rennstands come with, and they are very well built. All the welds look good and the side of the feet themselves are very wide - which results in very good stability.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNext are images of the saddle, as you can see the saddle can be removed from the rest of the Rennstand and be used to jack up the car. It also has a hole on top to allow various jack pad adapters to be attached to it.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNext are images of the pins, these are solid steel pins with a spring loaded ball at the end to keep it in place when clipped into the Rennstands. You get 4 pins per stand, 2 to connect the saddle to the legs, and another 2 to connect the legs to the feet. Each pin has a key ring on it to allow for easy removal even when wearing gloves.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNext are images of the jack pad adapter that is included with the Rennstand, it is just a standard pinch weld adapter, and comes with a large washer to distribute the load more evenly to the saddle.Credit: F87SourceFinally the last image is of the legs, and they are solid steel - not tubular like other versions of the Rennstands. I will talk more about these later on but they are very hefty for their size and are absolutely solid.Instructions Manual:Next I wanted to share the instructions manual for the Rennstands, because I dont think its available online and sharing it will allow anyone that wants to read it the opportunity to do so. Also, having it archived online will help anyone who has lost their instructions.View post on imgur.comTechnical Details:Now lets move onto the technical details.1) Base: The first thing I would like to talk about is the base of the Rennstands, because the stability of a jack stand comes from its base.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceIf we look into the size of the feet, my measurements have these feet at ~22.5 cm long, and the feet are ~4.76 cm wide (as per ETA MFG). The distance between the feet is ~33.33 cm in its lowest setting but increases to ~39.6875 cm in its highest setting (as per Rennstand) - this means as the stands get higher the base gets larger which adds to its stability. These dimensions give the Rennstands a very large footprint and base, making it incredibly stable overall. In fact I tried to test the stability of these jack stands by pushing on my car quite hard (well over 100 lbs of force) and there was no sign of movement or wobbling from the Rennstands. I also tried testing stability without any load on the Rennstands and they are pretty hard to push over. Another thing to note is that the Rennstands have pretty large flat feet - meaning it is going to be more resistant to sinking in softer ground, for instance asphalt when it gets very hot. The larger feet also do a better job spreading load across a larger surface area, meaning it is less likely to crack thinner concrete garage floors. Note: it is not recommended to use jack stands on anything but hard solid level ground.Now if we compare that to a traditional jack stand like my 2 ton AC Delco, they have a base of ~16 cm X 17 cm, so significantly smaller than the Rennstand. This leads to less overall stability, and why it was easier to push over when unloaded. The traditional jack stands also have smaller, very narrow and sharp feet, which means it will be more likely to sink on softer surfaces or damage the ground it is on.So overall we can see the feet and base of the Rennstand gives it tremendous stability compared to traditional jack stands despite its narrow appearance. Its wide feet also give it the ability to resist sinking and cracking the ground it is on, as it is able to spread the load over a larger surface area.2) Height and Access: The Rennstand has a maximum lift height of ~41.95 cm, which is comparable to the ESCO shorty jack stand (~43.18 cm) and other typical jack stands (they are taller than my no name certified jack stands, but are shorter than my moto master jack stands), and they offer significantly more underbody clearance than my rhino ramps. Compared to quick jacks they fall far behind, as quick jacks offer a lift height of ~60.96 cm.So overall access to the underbody is comparable to other jack stands, is greater than traditional ramps, and is less than quick jacks. However, the one major benefit of jack stands, Rennstands, and ramps over the quick jacks is side access to the underside of the car. This allows anyone easy access to the middle of the car by crawling from the sides of the car rather than from the front or the back - which you must do when using quick jacks as the massive frames take up the entire side of the car. So if you need to do a transmission oil flush, it is much easier to access the car from the side while holding a bottle of fluid with a pump sticking out from the top, vs. trying to crawl from the front of the back. Its also much easier to perform work that requires constant access to the middle of the underbody by going through the side vs. the front or the rear - for instance a clutch delay valve delete or short shifter install where you constantly have to go under the car to access things.3) Solid Steel legs: I would also like to discuss the legs that come with these Rennstands, and how they are solid steel bars and not hollow.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceAs you can see in the images above, the legs on the ETA MFG version of the Rennstands are completely solid metal, they are not hollow nor tubular unlike the original Rennstands - pictured below:Credit: starastronomerhttps://www.youtube.    com/watch?v=xj36YbaSljs&t=754s(remove the spaces if you want to see the video, I just put spaces so it wouldnt embed the video into the post)Now what this should mean is that the ETA MFG version of the Rennstands are going to be significantly stronger than the traditional Rennstand with their hollow legs, and that you can rest assured that these legs will be able to handle the weight of a car without an issue. There is no way that these legs will shear, bend, or have the pin holes fail when used under the rated weight limits. Like if you ever had the chance to hold these legs you would be able to feel how hefty and rock solid they are. They literally contribute the bulk majority of the weight to the overall Rennstand.So overall based on just the legs alone, the Rennstand 2.0 must be the strongest version of the Rennstand.4) Side Leg Removal: The ETA MFG Rennstand allows for the legs to be removed from the sides (pulled out to the left and the right of the saddle) vs. having to removed from under the saddle like on traditional Rennstands.Credit: ETA MFGhttps://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ece-p252276669Credit: F87SourceCredit: ECS Tuninghttps://www.ecstuning.com/b-rennstan...nd/18mrs3~rst/Credit: ECS Tuninghttps://www.ecstuning.com/b-rennstan...nd/18mrs3~rst/As you can see from the images above, the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand has legs that remove from the sides, whereas the other versions of the Rennstands have legs removable from the bottom. This means you have to lift the Rennstands a lot less to fit the legs in place compared to the alternate version.5) Material: The Rennstands are made from very strong carbon steel, and are electrostatically powder coated orange. This allows the Rennstands to be extremely strong, and well protected from corrosion.5) Jack Size: The Rennstands saddle has a jacking point of ~3, so you must have a corresponding floor jack with a saddle diameter of 3 or more so it can properly lift the Rennstand.6) BMW Jack Pad Adapter: The Rennstand has a variety of attachments for its saddle, one of which is a BMW specific jack pad adapter.https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p255054561Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo as you can see in the images above this is the BMW specific jack pad adapter, it also has a slot in the middle to double up as a pinch weld adapter for Dodge vehicles. Ive tried this specific adapter on my own M2 and it fits perfectly in the plastic jack pad, and has sufficient height to clear the sides of the adapter so it doesnt damage it. It also is tall enough to clear my rear M performance winglets - which sits right next to the plastic jacking point.7) Additional Jack Pad adapters: The Rennstands also have a variety of jack pad adapters that you can choose from. For instance they have a really cool saddle adapter:Credit: ETA MFGhttps://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p251403769That should be large enough to fit aluminum jack pad adapters for BMWs, incase you would like to use your existing jack pad adapters instead of the ones ETA MFG makes. You can also use this to put hockey pucks on it for use on the front center jacking point, and so much more. So this saddle adapter really opens up new possibilities.They also have flat top adapter pad for use on subframes, and they have honda, audi, tesla and porche specific pinch weld adapters as well if you want them.8) Price: The ETA MFG version of the Rennstands are ~$149.99 on sale (im pretty sure the sale is very frequent so it is almost a regular price), making them cheaper than the alternate versions of the Rennstands. So its a huge benefit that IMO the best version of the Rennstand is also the cheapest.9) Portability: Finally the last thing I would like to talk about is the portability of the Rennstands, since they can be dismantled into very small components, they are very portable and easily stored anywhere. This gives it a major advantage over traditional jack stands and even the quick jack - since these Rennstands can easily fit in the floor well on the passenger side, under trunk floor liners, in the back seat floor well, and can be easily stored in very smaller areas like under the stairs.Testing:Finally I would like to talk about load testing on the Rennstands, since this is a pretty important aspect for safety. Note: Everything im going to be talking about only applies to the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand, not the other versions you may find out there.So the ETA MFG Rennstands are rated for 3 Tons per pair under the ASME/PALD certification standards, which are more rigorous than the ANSI testing rules used by the alternate Rennstands and this is also why the weight ratings are done in pairs. However, when tested in house the ETA MFG version of the Rennstands were capable of holding over 6 tons each - but legally they were only able to rate it at 3 tons per paid as thats what the lab testing under ASME/PALD yielded.So rest assured that these Rennstands should be able to hold any BMW ever made without issue, and you will be safe while working underneath a car supported by these stands (given you are using them properly and within their rated weight).Rennstand in Action:Now lets take a look at some images of the Rennstand in action holding up my M2:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceAnd here are some images showing underbody height (specifically under the front bumper) when supported by the Rennstands:Credit: F87SourceFinally here is an image of how high it can lift the M2 as measured from the jacking point, and the result is ~43.5 cm.Credit: F87SourceAnd lets finish off the images with some pictures of the Rennstands when they are fully assembled:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNow finally let me go over some additional things I noticed when using these Rennstands on my own m2:1) Lifting Height: These Rennstands actually lift the m2 a surprising amount, as a result I am getting a lot more underbody clearance compared to my ramps and it makes working under the car and getting under the car a lot easier.2) Stability: I tested the stability of these Rennstands by pushing on the tire with considerable amounts of force (easily over 100 lbs) and the inside of the door panel to simulate lateral force along the centerline of the car and there was no movement or rattles/noises from the Rennstands - they were rock solid. This is extremely confidence inspiring especially since I will be using these for suspension work which requires torquing the lower control arms to ~130 ft lbs.3) Ease of use: The Rennstands were really easy to set up compared to my ramps, and literally only required a few pumps of a jack to lift the car up and get the Rennstands in place. Everything fit perfectly fine and there were no issues. Again this is a huge reason why I chose them over conventional jack stands, you jack them up right at the jacking points - no need to get fancy with where you put the jack stand, and no need to get creative with where you have to jack. So IMO the Rennstands blow away traditional jack stands and it isnt even a comparison.Note: I had to drive the front wheels up onto some 2 X 4 pieces of wood since the car was just a tiny bit low to clear the Rennstands with the floor jack I was using. Also If you use 2 floor jacks you would be able to go to max height in one go (as you would be able to lift the front all at once, and then the rear all at once), with just one floor jack you have to go one height setting at a time to not make the car tilt too much.4) Portability: These Rennstands were actually a lot larger than I initially anticipated since they have a massive base and width between their feet. However, since you can take them apart, storing it was really easy as I could just slide them beneath my stairs in the garage. This is even better than my ramps or jack stands because when it is taken apart the sum of its components are relatively small and easy to store and can fit in all sorts of places (as you can see from the size of the box that these things come in). Obviously this is also a significantly better solution than buying quick jacks, since I simply dont have the storage space for them, nor do I want to fork over $1600 for a set.5) Wheel clearance: Most people are worried that the Rennstands will not fit their car since the foot print is quite large, however the jack point location on our BMWs are far enough away from the wheels it was not even a remote issue.Summary:Overall I must say these Rennstands are absolutely excellent, they are extremely stable, convenient, offer massive lift height, and very easy to store as they can be dismantled. The Rennstands also solve a lot of the issues that the alternative lifting methods I described earlier have. For instance they allow you to have a jack stand right where you jack up the car so you dont have to struggle for a suitable location to put a jack stand (which as I described earlier a suitable location for jack stands are very limited and sometimes not even available on modern day BMWs), they lift the car by the jacking points so you can remove the wheel unlike with ramps, and they are cheaper, significantly more portable than quick jacks (great for people with limited storage ******* and allow side access under the car which the quick jacks cannot do. So for these reasons I personally think the Rennstands are an ideal choice to support your car, and why I recommend this product. I also recommend the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand over all of the other ones on the market, simply because: they have solid legs (meaning they are stronger than the hollow leg versions), the legs connect from the side meaning you dont have to jack the car up as high to remove them compared to other versions of the Rennstand, and they are cheaper than the other versions of the Rennstand. So IMO you get the best version of the Rennstand for cheaper, so why not pick the ETA MFG version.So if you are interested in purchasing the Rennstands heres are some links to do so:Rennstand:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ece-p252276669BMW Jack Pad adapter:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p255054561\n\nReserved for Future Posts.\n\nWell thought out excellent review!

    "title": "M2 differential and manual transmission fluid flush",
    "content": "Hey Guys,Has anyone done their differential and manual transmission fluid flushes yet? I know a few F8X guys have done this already, but my question was if you guys have used non oem fluids.I know the m2 requires MTF-LT-5 for the manual transmission and SAF-XJ rated fluid for the differential, and bmw has stated that an equivalent like castrol's 75W140 syntrax LSD would be ok for the diff. Has anyone used this before?Thanks--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit - 20/04/22So from the time I created this thread until now I have learned alot about differential oil on this platform and its availability. So here is a brief summary:1) You should use MSP/A if you can get it, this is what bmw stipulates to use via ista, real oem (their etk which real oem displays), and their differential recall tsb.2) I have realized that MSP/A is not available in the USA, so if you're in the US I would recommend to use SAF-XJ (not SAF-XJ + FM), the difference probably isn't huge and you should be absolutely fine with this. This might be the case in Canada as well, as I am hearing MSP/A is no longer available here. So alot of the earlier information I posted was deemed to be not fully accurate on this matter, because I was not aware MSP/A is not at all available in the USA. So if you cannot get MSP/A use SAF-XJ don't feel obligated to get it if you can't find it.3) Check your dealer invoice after the break in service, I have seem some cases where dealers are using SAF-XO fluid for the fluid change. This is fluid meant for open differentials and not limited slip diffs like what we have in our cars. So please ensure you don't have this fluid as it can cause severe damage, as it isn't the proper weight and doesn't have the required friction modifiers that the clutch packs require.4) This is an iffy one, but I would stay clear of aftermarket fluids if possible. I keep seeing stories of how fragile these diffs are and failing prematurely, some due to clutch packs wearing out early, some due to SAF-XJ +FM fluids being used (E9X m3 specified diff oil) - which is scary because some aftermarket differential oils are also suitable for the e9x m3 which makes me worried that it might have too much friction modifiers for our F8X diffs. so I would probably stick with OEM fluids for now.\n\nI changed mine myself at 9,700 miles and used BMW fluid for warranty reasons.

I think they did this because too many people kept using SAF-XJ + FM which damaged the diff and was only mean for the E9X M cars.Anyways on a different note I was wondering if anyone used the approved aftermarket oils. I am looking to use the castrol syntrax limited slip oil since it is alot cheaper than the OEM stuff (in canada anyways) and is approved as an alternate to bmw MSP/A.\n\nSubscribed (plan to do this myself after a few more track days).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDaytona_550Subscribed (plan to do this myself after a few more track days).I'm planning to do mine later this year, maybe September time so guess either one of us will be first lol to experiment I guess.Are you planning to go oem fluid or aftermarket?\n\nMost likely will go w/ OEM fluids (whether branded \"BMW\" or otherwise).\n\nSo what's the correct part number, local dealer is saying SAF-XJ-FM but online retailers are saying SAF-XJ 83222357992.Edit: was able to find my paperwork, 992 was done at 1200 miles service.

So who knows. Going after market maybe another option.\n\nThis is what my dealer just did. Should I be concerned?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bym20e3087Called few local BMWs, all are saying 992 is the replacement for 988. So who knows. Going after market maybe another option.Weird, but that's not what the bmw etk, tis, and tsb (that was released awhile back) says.Since I've seen so many dealers mess up with this simple procedure by still filling up with the saf-xj + FM fluid, I wouldn't trust them. I would trust the recommendations of bmw directly which is to run MSP/A.If you cannot get this I guess it would be a toss up between Castrol syntrax or saf-xj. What I can say is that saf-xj was used previously and I don't remember their being an issue, but Castrol syntrax is indeed recommended as a suitable replacement by bmw so it's your choice on what to use. I personally would have went with syntrax by following the tis.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJustinHEMIThis is what my dealer just did. Should I be concerned?Yeah you should be very worried. Your dealer majorly messed up, looking at saf-xo it is not the correct weight at 75w90 instead of 75w140.Next is that it was made for non limited slip diffs so it does not have the correct friction modifiers to make the clutch discs slip properly without major wear and tear. So your diff is at a huge risk of failing prematurely.This is a prime example of why I don't trust dealer ships.\n\nFuckers, and I put about 1000 miles on it since then, including hard driving. I am going on a rally this weekend. I need to find a place to get the correct stuff and do it myself. I assume it's a standard diff..., drain and fill plugs?\n\nThis site also says 992 is replacement for 988. Is the 992 correct?https://www.bimmerworld.com/Fluids/D...222365988.htmlThanksJustin\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceYeah you should be very worried.

So your diff is at a huge risk of failing prematurely.This is a prime example of why I don't trust dealer ships.Also I wanted to add on that it is absolutely mind blowing dealers are still making mistakes on this on procedure. I would also check the part numbers of your oil and oil filter to ensure there is no mess up. Because I know another common mess up is that the dealership will put a Mann hu816x (filter for common n55's and n54's) instead of a Mann hu8011z (filters for the m2 N55 and s55) filter.Another piece of advice is not to leave the dealer until you check all of the part numbers to the bmw etk. I'm lucky enough that my dealer is really competent (and they know I'm crazy OCD so they graciously take good care of me) so I don't have to worry too much, even though I still really do not like dealerships at all because I'm worried they will mess up.",

    "title": "S55 M2C Ticking/Clicking noise",
    "content": "First-time poster here. I’m the original owner of a 2019 M2 Competition, which I’ve had for about six years now. Around three years ago, I started noticing a clicking/ticking noise coming from the engine bay. The intensity and loudness vary—sometimes it’s barely noticeable, while other times it’s impossible to ignore, as you can hear in the attached video.I might be imagining this, but I swear the car feels noticeably smoother and more responsive when the noise isn’t present—unfortunately, that doesn’t happen very often.One possible trend I’ve noticed: if the car has been sitting in the garage unused for a while, the sound doesn’t appear right away after I start driving. However, if I turn the engine off and then back on mid-trip, the noise tends to return. I’m not 100% certain about this, but it’s the only pattern I’ve observed.The service center in San Francisco repeatedly denied hearing the noise when I brought the car in for service, both when it was in and out of warranty. However, when I finally showed them the attached video—where it’s impossible to ignore—they dismissed it as “normal” and not a cause for concern.I’ve scoured various forums, and the closest matching cases seem to attribute similar sounds to loose bolts. The car is completely stock with 18,000 miles, and I intend to keep it that way for decades to come.I’m at my wit’s end—I just want the car to consistently drive as smoothly as it does when the noise isn’t present. Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated!P.S. Please forgive any lack of technical expertise—this is my first M and first BMW.\n\nThat's the exhaust cam ledge bolt issue.

Either have the dealer \"good will\" it, have an indy do it or do it yourself.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byomasouIf documented under warranty, it should be covered.I have the car in service now, I had moved to a new city but I shared with them documentation of the issue, or at least of me having described it, while the car was still under warranty, from the SF dealership. They just quoted me an outrageous amount, $3100 for \"removing the valve cover gasket for further inspection\". I had given them the Puma number from the thread quoted above and reference to it.....sigh.. do you know if this inspection is related? and who do I contact to see if BMW will cover this? the car has already been with them for a couple of weeks before they even got back to me with this quote\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjordantiiDon't let it go. Either have the dealer \"good will\" it, have an indy do it or do it yourself.any advice on above?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byibra90any advice on above?No advice for the dealer. I just watched the videos, ordered the parts and tools then did it myself.\n\nHello Everyone,Quick update, after a lot of back and forth, BMW of NA agreed to cover the fix under warranty. I just picked up the car and I can confirm, for now, the sound is gone. They said  they didnt see any scoring, but I asked them for a picture of the cam shaft and you can see attached what they sent me. I am not experienced enough to know what to make of it. But otherwise, the S55 is humming like a bee now.Here is a summary of what was done to it and the parts used:The dealership essentially refreshed the valvetrain on both intake and exhaust sides by swapping out the worn lifters and associated hardware. They accessed the top of the engine by removing the valve cover and the exhaust camshaft. After installing all new lifters, levers, and necessary gaskets/bolts, they sealed it back up. They said this should address any valvetrain noise or performance issues that come from failing lifters and rocker components.Parts used:•\tPROFILE GASK BMSA•\tGASKET-FLANG BMSA•\tGASKET RING BMBIMI•\tDECOUPLING E BMRSA•\tVENT HOSE BM•\tGASKET BMSA•\tTORX BOLT BMSA•\tROLLER DRAG BMSA•\tALIGNMENT EL BMSA•\tCOLLAR SCREW BMSA•\tGASKET RING BMMISAlet me know if anyone needs any more info or has any comments on the picAttachment 3719108",

For example pennzoil platnium euro 5w40 found at walmart in 5L jugs for 1/3 the price of liqui moly has better specs in every single regard from HTHS, NOACK, etc due to its GTL base making it a cleaner oil.

IIRC castrol 0w40 is better than castrol 5w40, but both imo are inferior to pennzoil platnium euro 5w40 which is a newer formulation, has higher HTHS, lower NOACK (iirc) at ~6%, due to its GTL base stock. Motul xcess 5w40 gen 2 (has to be gen 2) is pretty good/equal to pennzoil as well, but since the specs are really similar/almost the same in key aspects like HTHS to pennzoil so I would just get pennzoil as it is far cheaper. So overall I really like the pennzoil option and it is what I am going to use for my car next year, as it is an extremely well spec'ed oil with great performance and track capable, at a dirt cheap price.Where really expensive oils come into play is If you are really tracking your car hard with over 600 whp with super high oil temps and you want/need even more sheer stability at that point then you would go with 300v, or redline 5w40. But before then there would be no need.But remember the only way to truly know if your car needs a more expensive oil like 300v or redline is to run a used oil analysis, guessing and speculation is pretty much useless as it leads to comments like \"bmw twin power turbo 0w30 is bad because it is like water\".\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceIt's not LL01 anymore after the reformulation so that's why bmw is not listed.

Would you recommend sticking with BMW oil, or the Pennzoil Platinum 5w40?I'm in Missouri also, where temps range from -5°F in winter to 105°F in Summer.Well for colder conditions the 0w30 would suit it better as it will flow easier on cold starts.However, -5°F isn't that cold imo as it is about -20°C and the pour point of Pennzoil platinum euro 5w40 is all the way down to -45°C. So you wouldn't necessarily experience a huge negative with the ppe 5w40 during the winter if you insist on going with a 40 weight. If it was colder like -30°C or worse then I would definitely move to the 0w30. Also I wanted to say living here in Canada where it gets down to -35°C in the winter at times I've never really experienced any negatives running a 5w40 oil in my past subarus, and almost all subaru guys do the same. The important part is to let it warm up before driving it. I generally let it warm to 42°C before I drive my m2 in the summer. Then do not push it hard (no WOT and don't exceed 3000 rpm) until it fully warms up which is 90°C.But seeing that you're in the USA (important because you have more pricing options for oil) and seeing how you do not track your car too much (not that the 0w30 can't take track use, but a higher weight oil would be able to take more abuse) I would recommend you just stay on the factory bmw twin power turbo 0w30 oil. The reason why I recommend this is because of the few reasons below:1) You live in the USA so you can get the bmw oil for pretty cheap as you do not have to buy it from the stealership.2) Despite being a 0w30 oil the bmw tpt 0w30 oil is quite stout with an hths of ~3.5, so it should have no issues with occasional track days.3) since you daily your car in the winter a 0w30 oil will help minimize as much wear as possible during those cold winter start ups. A 5w40 shouldn't be too much worse in the cold if you really must have a 40 weight, but a 0w30 oil will definitely flow better and for a daily every bit helps to minimize wear and increase longevity.4) I wouldn't really worry about your summer temps, for street driving your oil cooler should keep everything in check. If you are hitting limp mode just with street driving something is wrong with your car. For track use as long as your temps stay below limp mode you'll be fine on 0w30, because that bmw oil is stout. If you are exceeding limp mode temps or have a heavily modded m2 I would probably step up to a 40 weight or upgrade the oil cooler, or do both depending on temps and oil analysis. Also alot of guys on bitog intentionally buy bmw 0w30 to use in non bmws because of how good it is. So don't listen to those people that call it water.5) all my advice is just a guide line, every one experiences slightly different conditions based on driving etc. So your best bet is to do a used oil analysis as that will give you the best answers. For example if you see more wear metals running a 40 weight in the winter you must go to a 30 weight. Or if you see alot of wear metals running a 30 weight in the summer you should step up to a 40 weight and get a test.But generally speaking for a stock/lightly modded m2, bmw did a fricken good job pairing it with the 0w30 oil, as it should just about suit every condition.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceWell for colder conditions the 0w30 would suit it better as it will flow easier on cold starts.However, -5°F isn't that cold imo as it is about -20°C and the pour point of Pennzoil platinum euro 5w40 is all the way down to -45°C.

I had always planned to go basic Stage 2 when the warranty runs out, just a Wagner IC and 93 octane flash, but having second thoughts about that.  I'm one of those guys that just wants to get the parts, flash it, and forget it forever.  I don't want any issues.  So maybe I'll get the IC and flash the 91 tune (even though all I use is 93).My car will NEVER see a track.

If so, How?What do you mean? I didn't say that.Also I would like to correct a few things since pennzoil reformulated recently:1) PPE 5w40's pour point went up to -36ºC instead of -45ºC like the old version, so another reason for visualecho to stick with bmw TPT 0w30. But since his winter temps don't get worse than around -20ºC he could technically still run it in the winter, although it would be better from a wear perspective to run 0w30 which would fit well with his all year round driving style + infrequent track useage.2) Comparing PPE 0w40 vs PPE 5w40 CCS viscosity at -30ºC is lower for 0w40 by 600 cP.

Im assuming the rears have the non-rust rotors and they just washed it so it built rust. Either way I could replace the rotors myself if needed.\n\nCarMax also allows 10 days to return so Im going to take it for a PPI during that time\n\nPyesPrice looks goodIf it were mine Id service the transmission, and the diff right awayAt 45,000 both of mine were very dirtyI replaced my oil cooler thermostat with the aftermarket. It never exceed 200°F. Vs 240 oemThese Eng  just dont need that high temperatureMy Miata runs 170° factory Thermostat.  has great performance and great gas mileage.Two Toyotas: one runs 180 thermostat one runs 195\n\nThe late break in was very common during covid, more relevant is whether it got short-cycle oil changes the rest of the time (e.g. at about 5-7k, rather than the 10-11k that the car asks for).  Even that isn't a deal-breaker, just s/t to consider.At 60k it is getting due for some expensive maintenance that you should budget in or get the dealership to pay for if possible (but don't let them actually do it, get it done at a good indie shop).  Likely it is due for trans and differential fluid change, new spark plugs, brake fluid flush (probably at least a grand from a shop, plugs might be a grand on their own).  These brakes turn rusty at every car wash, and look crappy til you get on them a few times, so can't tell by looking at those rears - likely getting to the point they need new rotors/pads, if not already replaced;  that is probably another 2k (go w/ fcpEURO, and you get free lifetime replacement).  Act like you are sure they are totally crapped out and hit the dealer up for a discount - make them look up the job price for 4 wheel rotor/pad swap direct from BMW for some sticker shock.For PPI, have them look for signs of body work, removal of aftermarket speed parts (especially drivetrain stuff - turbos, suspensions, etc.), or cheapo replacement parts that suggest an ignorant/cheap prior owner.  Carfax isn't very reliable (easy to hide issues, sometimes things on it that did not happen), and don't trust a/t that Carmax tells you as they are totally playing the 'plausible deniability' game.Don't let this scare you off, it's just the price of driving the best car ever made.  You'll end up spending way more than this trying to get your jaw re-aligned after having the constant huge grin for the first few months.\n\n@Maynard,Thanks for the feedback! Looks like brake fluid was flushed at 53k and spark plugs at 45k so hopefully they both are good for another while.Yeah the trans and diff fluid I will plan on replacing ASAP. The PPI shop I plan to go to specializes in BMWs so Im hoping they will catch anything funky.Quick question- would the service history on the iDrive show details such as if trans/diff fluid was flushed?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypyes@Maynard,Thanks for the feedback!

There were a couple of minor issues that were resolved, so if the PPI goes well then Im gonna pull the trigger on this car!The tech agreed that the diff and trans fluids were most likely never changed. Ill budget to get those and the coolant flushed soon.Thanks for your input! BMW community has been super helpful.\n\nAlso I just looked up the prices for brake parts.

This I think is helping me diagnose closer to where the problem could be, but looking at real OEM I havent been able to figure out what this bolt is or if its even possible that the transmission could be leaking from it.I dont see any oil above the bolt and I dont see any oil on the right sister bolt. It seems to be coming from this bolt as I havent been able to see any dyed oil above it.Any help identifying what this bolt is or whether or not it could even be the problem would be great. Also, any ideas on what would be necessary to check its tightness as I cant fit a socket in it given the transmission mount is in the way.\n\nHeres a picture without the UV light.\n\nDCT or 6MT?",

But yes it is some really good stuff, so you don't need to worry about it, you can use this stuff throughout your warranty period and even track it without worry.I know there is alot of people saying that it is just like \"water\" and you need thicker oil for better protection but that is not the case. Durability is based on HTHS, wear additives etc, not solely on oil weight. For eg. you can get a really good 30 weight oil with the same or maybe even better HTHS than a crap 40 weight oil.If you street drive your car there will be no case in which you ever need thicker oilregardlessof how hot your climate is. Because you will never be able to hit conditions on the street that will heat your oil up enough to warrant a thicker oil weight, and your oil cooler will take care of oil temperatures. If you think you need a thicker weight oil for street driving your oil cooler is either not working, you are making huge power (no ots map s don't count im talking super large turbo upgrades and if you have an s55 the oil cooler is so large this won't ever be an issue), or you live on Venus.You can even track your car on bmw TPT because of how stout it is, although if heavily modded you should get a thicker oil with a better hths rating.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourcenice!It has already been done on BOITOG iirc, and the conclusion over there is that bmw TPT 0w30 is very very stout robust oil - showing that tinner =/= mean bad oil or inadequate protection.I am curious about how castrol's take on bmws TPT 0w30 will be though.The VOA you referring is done on TPT 5W30.

If you don't mind me asking, what's your background related to oils? What would you describe as a light track day vs. pushing it to the limits? I ask because I have used 300V in the past for race bikes, and wouldn't hesitate to use it or Sport in the car, but if 8100 would be OK, I can get a good deal on that oil.For context, I've done 6 days at COTA in the last 1600 miles (rough math says that's ~860 miles on track) and have a couple days coming up over the next couple of months. These are pretty standard days where sessions are 25-30 minutes each. The frequency of track days will slow down over the summer for me due to the heat. I just don't enjoy being outside in 95°+ temps all day. And as of lately, the car doesn't get driven much between eventsmaybe the odd evening cruise or something similar.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM1500ZThanks for recommendations and sharing the TAN/TBN bitI'm not sure what those stand for so I'll need to learn me something.Here's a good read about TBN/TAN from Blackstone Labs:https://www.blackstone-labs.com/do-i-need-a-tbn/\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byLbsigmanIt's a virgin oil analysis so there shouldn't be any lead, theoretically.There's also no lead in the bearings anymore even if it were a UOA.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydetroitm2Quote:Originally Posted byedycolUnder warranty?Motul X-Cess 5-W40 GEN2Pennzoil Platinum Euro 5W40No more warranty?If just light track day:Castrol Edge 0W40If push to limits at track:Motul 5W40 Sport (you can maybe do 5k interval, do UOA).Motul 5W40 300V (absolutely do UOA after 3k).Redline 5W40 performance (absolutely do UOA after 3k).In all instances you want to do UOA and get TAN measurement!

    "content": "Hello everyone - I noticed my piston dust boots were starting to crack from the heat generated from track usage.First get to the point where the brake pads are removed and the caliper is unbolted. Make sure you have a place to rest the caliper (like on top of the disc) and have a hanger so you are not stressing the brake line. You do not need to complete remove the caliper.]Below: I purchased the Giro Disc boots because they were available and shipped with the titanium brake shims I also planned to purchase. I can't comment on the quality of the boot, but I trust that Giro Disc will be providing at least OEM quality or better.Below is the condition of my dust boots after 7 HPDE weekends at Advanced/Instructor pace. I tapped the brakes a few times to get the pistons to moved outward so the grooves are extended out of the caliper. You don't need to move them out much.Below I liberally sprayed down the piston faces with brake clean and wiped it down to remove the large amount of caked on brake dust and contamination. I used a small screw driver to peel out the cracked boots. It take a little work, but eventually they come free.Below is new seals compared to oldBelow is installing the new seal. First make sure the caliper and piston groove is free of contamination. A simple wipe with a shop towel to getting the nooks and crannies is fine. You have to stretch the inner lip around the piston groove. I did not use any grease or lube. It probably would have helped, but it didn't seem to affect installation. The seals came out dry, so they went back in dry. The inner lip might roll a little bit, so I wiggled the seal fore and aft, and rotated it by hand to make sure the inter lip seated properly. Then I simply pressed it into the caliper by hand.Below I used the heel of a hex wrench to fully seat the seal into the caliper. I moved the pistons in and out with my fingers to make sure everything was fully seated.Good luck!\n\nThanks for sharing this. I have new seals/boots but have been procrastinating. Will bookmark this post when the time comes to do it.",

My recommendation comes from a mix of personal and professional data.The additive package can mean a lot. LL01FE is nothing special in any aspect. It has a depleted additive package compared to previous SOPUS version LL01, and I highly doubt they use star polymers like you can find in 300V, HPL etc. So, it comes down to HTHS and ZDDP package, which for fuel efficiency purposes, is lowered in LL01FE (hence FE), and ZDDP is considerably depleted compared to the previous 5W30 LL01, or let's say, the mentioned oils.0W30 might be OK on some low altitude tracks or where there is no excessive heat, considering the oversized cooling capacity of F series models, M or non-M, but I would still go oils with Porsche A40 approval for a peace of mind.\n\nReally appreciate everyone's feedback, thank you!My car's stock in terms of power mods and I don't see myself adding power anytime soon\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolX-Cess GEN2 is replacement for X-Cess.

I guess for them lifetime ends when warranty expires.\n\nWell, probably look at changing it if you're heading towards 100k miles. It's fully synthetic, it isn't exposed to water, and there are no combustion products to worry about so it will last years without degrading. High/hard use will result in some wear to the innards of the gearbox however, so changing it will help keep any traces of worn metal out of the moving parts.I changed the transmission fluid on my e46 at 150k miles. It was not a good colour (completely black) and the shift action was much, much better afterwards. I've been running it on non filled for life stuff since with changes every couple of years to flush out the remains of the old fluid.\n\nOver the last 200,000 miles in my e92 328i and Acura TSX, I always changed the transmission fluid every 30,000 miles. And after every flush, the shifts always felt smoother. I think there's definitely some fluid degradation that happens. I use Redline MTL now and previously used GM Synchromesh FM in the Acura.I had my e92 in the shop this week and went ahead and had them do a transmission fluid flush even though my fluid was only 2 years and 20,000 miles old. And there was still a noticeable improvement in shift actions. It feels like the synchros aren't working as hard.So from now on, my MT fluid changes are going to happen every 2 years or 30,000 miles.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bym2-6mtI wonder what makes it Lifetime? I guess for them lifetime ends when warranty expires.That's basically it, the lifetime of the vehicle is the amount of time BMW expects the average person to own one of their cars before they replace it with a newer model. From that standpoint, their 'lifetime' fluids will last the lifetime of the vehicle. From a long term ownership standpoint, you should absolutely be changing your 'lifetime' fluids as part of yearly/mileage based routine maintenance. How often you do will depend on how you drive and may simply be based on mileage or something you'll want to do every year regardless of mileage (e.g. if you track the car, you really should be changing transmission fluid at least once each season).Once I finally get my M2, I do intend on replacing the transmission fluid around the same time I get my break in service done and regularly thereafter. It's cheap insurance for a car I intend to own for a very long time. Plus I plan on sending a sample off for analysis so I have a baseline to work with for future reference.\n\nNever thought of this and I intend to keep my car a long time. Should I change it out?

    "title": "Turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug",
    "content": "Introduction:So in this product review I will be taking a look at the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug, and why this is the only magnetic drain plug you should buy for your bmw. Before we begin I must thank ECS tuning/Turner motorsports for giving me a partial discount on the products that I will be using in this review, however I will be as unbiased as possible despite that.Disclaimer:Any technical advice, installation instruction, or product installation is done so at your own risk I will not be responsible for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.Quick intro for those of you that dont like long articles:Cheap magnetic drain plugs made of brass or aluminium commonly break leaving the body of the bolt inside your drain pan resulting in alot of struggles to extract it. Cheap magnetic drain plugs can also have incorrect thread pitches and diameters that will result in damage to your oil pan threads. These cheap magnetic drain plugs can also utilize cheap neodymium magnets that loose their magnetic abilities at temperatures lower than what your engine oil gets to during operating conditions, this means that the magnetic drain plug will let go of all the metal debris it has stuck to until it cools down meaning it is essentially useless. The turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug address all of these issues and provides a magnetic drain plug that has no flaws that a cheaper plug or even a more expensive drain plug may have. Overall if you are looking for a magnetic drain plug this is the best magnetic drain plug available in my opinion.Table of contents:1) Risk of a Cheap aluminium or brass drain plug2) Benefits of titanium drain plugs over aluminium and brass drain plugsa) Defining metal tensile strength and yield strengthb) Metal tensile strength and yield strengthsc) Summary of why cheap drain plugs fail3) Turner motorsports titanium oil drain pluga) Quick overview with picturesb) Specsi) Thread pitchii) Diameteriii) Hex sizeiv) Copper washer fitmentv) Magnetic strength and talk about surface areac) Images of the drain plug fully installedd) Addressing some concernsi) Stripping threadsii) Drain Plug diameteriii) Drain Plug thread pitchiv) Magnets coming loosev) Head rounding offe) Additional stock drain bolt imagesf) SummaryRisk of a cheap aluminium or brass drain plug:So why should you use a titanium magnetic drain plug over a brass or aluminium drain plug? There are a few reasons for this, but one reason is cheaply made plugs often found on aliexpress can have the incorrect thread pitch or bolt diameter leaving your oil pan threads stripped (and if you own an ///M vehicle the oil pans are $1000 USD so it is best not to risk it), more on this later on. Another reason is because the weaker brass and aluminium drain plugs are susceptible to breaking at quite low torque specs and this can leave the end of the plug stuck in the oil drain pan threads resulting in a huge hassle to extract this portion of the bolt.Here are some examples of this:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...84&postcount=7This m2C owner has had an aluminium magnetic drain plug snap in the oil pan long before the torque required to crush the copper washer was achieved.Credit: Diamente Post #16https://www.toyotanation.com/threads...#post-13124826Credit: Diamente Post #16https://www.toyotanation.com/threads...#post-13124826In these images you see a toyota owner with a broken magnetic drain plug from Greddy which is also aluminium.The benefits of titanium drain plugs over aluminium and brass drain plugs:Defining metal tensile strength and yield strength:To explain this we must go into terms such as yield strength, and tensile strength.Yield Strength: How much force it takes to induce plastic deformation and permanently deform the bolt, meaning the bolt is permanently stretched and will not spring back to its preloaded length after releasing (unscrewing) the fastener. This is an important metric because if the yield strength is too low you can end up stretching a drain bolt over and over again while torquing a plug resulting in its fatigue and eventual failure.Tensile Strength: How much force a bolt is able to resist in its axial (lengthwise) direction before failing aka snapping/breaking.Before we go into the strength comparison below we need to note that the turner motorsports titanium drain plug is made out of grade 5 Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy.Metal Tensile and Yield Strengths:Titanium Grade 5 Ti-6Al-4V Alloy: Tensile strength = ≥ 895 MPa, Yield strength = ≥ 828 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=9299Brass: Tensile strength = 360 MPa, Yield strength = 140 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6380Aluminium 6061 Alloy: Tensile Strength = 310 MPa, Yield Strength = 276 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6636So looking at this data we can see titanium (Ti-6Al-4V alloy used by turner motorsports in their drain plug) is nearly ~3X stronger than both the 6061 aluminium alloy and brass alloys in terms of tensile strength. The titanium is also nearly ~4x stronger than aluminium in terms of yield strength and nearly ~8X stronger than brass in terms of yield strength. So straight off the bat we are dealing with a significantly stronger metal meaning it will take much higher torques to break a drain plug made of this material, and you are more likely to strip the threads out of your aluminium drain pan before breaking the plug in terms of maximum torque you can apply. This is great because the common reports of failure was that cheaper plugs broke before the prescribed torque specs were reached, so making these plugs out of titanium will prevent that from ever happening, and prevent fatigue induced failures. This is even more important because magnetic drain plugs are hollow inside for magnet placement, so they are already weaker than solid bolts so a strong metal is really vital to avoid breaks.Quickly looking at the cheaper plugs we can speculate that they fail due to the following reasons:1) The problem normally occurs because of the fact that alot of people working on these cars do not use torque wrenches or poorly calibrated torque wrenches. You commonly hear of owners saying it is tight when it is tight, wrist tight, one ugga dugga etc. When gauging how much torque or how tight they should have their drain bolts. Well this is a problem especially on cheaper magnetic drain plugs because they are made of aluminium or brass which has a really low tensile strength which you can easily exceed if you are not being careful and thus end up breaking the bolt.2) Reuse of old copper washers. I cant believe I even have to bring this up but the copper washers are single use only, once they are crushed down they are finished. If you reuse them at the bmw prescribed torque they will leak and if you try to stop the leak with more torque to crush it down more then you will either strip your pan or break your bolt.3) Even if tensile strength limits of a bolt is not exceeded one can still reach the yield point of the bolt which can cause permanent plastic deformation of the bolt forever weakening it due to fatigue (this is why you should never reuse torque to yield bolts). Over time if this is done alot your bolt will snap.4) The bolt gets a bit seized due to road debris (this one is not very likely because bmw puts a nice cover to protect the drain plug, unless you have an M car because the stiffening plate does not have a cover, but the situation as a whole is also no likely unless you live in a really dirty environment) and the force it take to break the bolt free is higher than the tensile strength of the bolt resulting in breaks.5) Metal impurities weakening the metalOverall I have seen alot of horror stories of aluminium and brass drain bolts snapping inside of the oil sump, and this is what prevented me from buying a magnetic drain plug until finally Turner motorsports solved this issue by releasing a magnetic drain plug made out of titanium. This stronger metal that the turner motorsports drain plug is constructed out of should prevent any breaking issues regardless if you over tighten it (you are more likely to strip out your oil pan threads so please use a properly calibrated torque wrench these sumps are expensive to replace at $1k for M vehicles and alot of labour costs as well if you cannot diy, and the walls of the drain hole are so thin you cannot timersert or helicoil it), the bolt gets seized from road debris, and even if there were small impurities in the metal the overall strength of titanium should be high enough to compensate and prevent failure.Turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug:Quick overview - with pictures:So lets begin our over view of this magnetic drain plug!Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceSpecs:Now lets discuss some of the specs of this titanium magnetic drain plug.i) Thread pitch: The thread pitch of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug is M12 X 1.5 X 20, so the pitch is 1.5 mm. Comparing this to the stock plug that has been used pretty much on all bmws for the last couple of decades, the stock plug is M12 X 1.5 X 16 (https://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/par...&q=11137535106).Here are some images of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug and stock drain plug having their thread pitch measured, and being meshed together to ensure there are no thread pitch anomalies. Note that metric bolts have a 60 degree thread angle so my thread pitch tool will also verify this angle if it fits snugly.Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceAs you can see by these images the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plugs thread pitch is exactly the 1.5 mm as required by the bmw oil pan, and is perfectly meshed with the stock plug and thread pitch gauge. This means that the thread pitch of this drain bolt is perfect and will not cause any issues. The only difference is that the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug is 20 mm long vs 16 mm of the stock plug. The length discrepancy however is not an issue due to the fact that the there is nothing the plug can hit even if it is longer.ii) Diameter: Next we will examine the diameter bolt of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug compared to the stock one with digital calipers, and with a swiping technique to get the maximum diameter (major diameter) of a cylindrical object.Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceAs you can see by these images the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain bolt has a major diameter of 11.90 mm and the stock drain bolt has a major diameter of 11.77 mm.iii) Hex size: The turner motorsports titanium drain plug also features a 17mm hex which is the same size as the factory drain plug. Here is an image of the hex being measured with digital calipers.Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87SourceAs you can see the hex is exactly 17.00 mm so it will fit perfectly in hex sockets (which are actually slightly bigger than 17.00 mm by a small amount) with nearly no play, this means that the hex will not suffer from damage by being slightly too small which means there will be play in the socket. The hex also has a decent depth of 7.51 mm as well so it will be able to better fit hex sockets without slipping out even when flush against the oil pan. The stock drain plug actually has a hex that is 16.56 mm so a bit off of the 17.00 mm so it actually has a bit more play vs the turner bolt in a 17 mm socket as those (like I just said) sockets are slightly bigger than 17 mm to account for bolt tolerances.iv) Copper washer fitment: I was not able to get images of the various washer fitments while performing the oil change but here is what I noted:a) The included copper washer with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain bolt had a larger diameter compared to the genuine Bmw copper washer that was present from my last dealership performed oil change. However the thickness remains the same. With this washer it will be larger than the hex of either the turner or stock bolt and stick out.b) The genuine Bmw copper washer was the exact same in terms of diameter and thickness as the copper washer that was included in the mann hu8011z oil filter (this is the exact same one as the genuine Bmw oil filter minus the ///M logo, all the part numbers on the filter from mann were the same). With this washer it will be smaller than the hex head and stay quite hidden underneath the stock bolt or the turner bolt.c) What I noticed was that despite the Turner provided copper washer having a larger diameter it doesnt really perform any differently than the stock or mann supplied copper washer. This is because there is a small circular raised lip underneath of the titanium plugs hex, this is the only part that contacts the copper washer and it is a bit smaller than the genuine Bmw/Mann copper washer. So having a larger washer wouldnt really benefit it too much as all the force that crushes the washer down is in a diameter smaller than the larger turner washer. The stock drain bolt behaves the same way with the washer being actually smaller than the hex just like on the turner drain bolt, so a larger washer wouldnt really benefit anything in terms of providing more seal as the outer edges wouldnt be crushed down anyways.So overall I opted to use the mann crush washer and there have been zero issues/leaks.v) Magnetic  grade strength and surface area: Not many people think about the magnet type itself when purchasing a magnetic drain plug, but I am here to tell you that not all magnets are the same for the reasons below.The turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug utilizes a neodymium grade n42 type SH magnet (https://www.albmagnets.com/neodymium...ts-grades.html) which retains its magnetic efficacy up to 150℃, however when talking to an engineer from Turner motorsports he informed me in their testing efficacy of the magnet was not lost until 204℃. These numbers are incredibly good especially since bmw starts to cut power at 132℃ and full limp mode occurs before 150℃ - so you will never have to worry about the magnet loosing its ability to cling onto metal particles even at high track temps. This is fantastic because some cheaper magnetic drain plugs utilize cheap magnets which lose their efficacy at 80℃ meaning it will not work even when the engine is below operating temperature (operating temps for oil is at 90℃).  So essentially when your car warms up those cheapo magnets let go of all the metal they have captured and let it free directly into the oil pick up.... Then the only time they will capture anything is when the engine is off and the oil has cooled down and that means they are only able to catch particles that have settled onto the magnet, as opposed to when the engine is on and oil is sloshing around. So here you can see not all magnets are made the same and thus if you cheap out on a drain plug you could essentially get a useless paper weight.The strength of this magnet is also really impressive, it can hold a large wrench and still provide a decent bit of retention even when I pull against it with the help of gravity. So that is really nice, and note even if those cheaper magnetic drain plugs can hold alot of weight if the magnet grade is not designed for high temps then all that strength is for nothing.But speaking in terms of a numbers side of things neodymium grade n42 magnets have a Br rating (it is the magnetic property that is independent of magnet shape and is the magnetic induction remaining after a magnetic field has been removed from a magnetic material it is trying to induce a magnetic field in) of 13,200 Gauss (https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog.asp...20the%20magnet.) while offering the highest operating temperature possible. So essentially it is a really strong magnet even compared to the competition which offers neodymium magnets in the low 4 digit gauss ratings.Finally I must mention surface area. This magnetic drain plug has some of the best magnet surface area out there, because the not only is the tip of the magnet exposed but the magnet also protrudes out giving it more surface area than even some of the best brand name plugs out there. This helps the plug capture more metallic debris than any of the other competitors that may rival this drain plug.Images of the drain plug fully installed:Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceSo here are my install images of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug on my bmw m2. The first image shows a view directly underneath of the drain plug and as you can see it fits perfectly in the hole, and has plenty of clearance all the way around for a 17 mm socket. There is nothing abnormal with the way it fits and does not cause any issues. Overall it fits perfectly and looks quite nice.The second image shows a side view of the drain plug and you can see the mann hu8011z supplied copper crush washer underneath of the drain plug fitting perfectly just like how it would on the stock drain bolt. There has been zero leaks after 2 weeks of my pennzoil platinum euro 5w40 oil change and the drain plug being installed, a lot of hard kms have also been put on it with oil temperatures reaching 98C and there has been no issues whatsoever. So I am very happy thus far with the fit and finish of this drain bolt it has given me no issues at all.Addressing some concerns:While doing research for this review I have stumbled upon a couple of concerns and a bunch of misinformation regarding issues with magnetic drain plugs and I would like to address them.1) Stripping threads: I have heard so much about how after market plugs can strip the oil drain pan plugs, but this generally is not the case. If the aftermarket drain plug has the same thread pitch, and plug diameter as the stock drain plug stripping can only be due to these reasons I have listed below (note aluminium pans already have weaker threads than steel pans):a) The threads in the oil pan are not cleaned out during oil changes and residual oil acts like a torque multiplier and you end up putting more torque on the drain plug than what was required resulting in faituging of the threads. This over time and repetitive cycles will cause the drain pan threads  to fail.b) Reuse of the factory crush washer, again you have to over tighten the drain plug as a result to compensate for any leaks due to the crush washer already being crushed down, resulting in stripped threads.c) Not using a torque wrench and using the bmw prescribed torque specs and thus over tightening the pan (this is the big one).d) Cross threading the drain plug because it was not put in by hand first.e) Use of impact tools or any power tools on the drain bolt.2) Drain plug diameter: Before we can discuss this I must include an image demonstrating diameters.Credit: Site admin from all America thread products, August 28, 2015.https://330zpr17apfr1j45wba4i5dj-wpe...-1-768x327.jpgFrom this image you can see there are a couple of different parameters that a bolt may have:a) major diameter: the outermost diameter and the one that classifies what type of bolt it is eg m12 or m8 etc. (I measured the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain bolts major diameter above).b) minor diameter the innermost diameter the pitch diameter the midpoint between the major and minor diameterc) the thread angle this is another factor that determines if a bolt is metric or inch based, for eg. metric bolts have 60 degrees of thread angle (my thread pitch tool was 60 degrees so it also measured thread angle as a result of measuring thread pitch).d) pitch which determines the spacing between the threads (as we have measured earlier).So I have also heard chatter about how aftermarket drain plug major diameters are smaller than stock or smaller than the required 12.00 mm of an m12 drain bolt causing the drain plug to strip. Again this is complete nonsense, every bolt even the factory one (as measured above) can vary from the perfect 12.00 mm spec (actually no bolt should be exactly 12.00 mm in terms of major diameter otherwise it might get cause too much galling due to it being way too tight, or seize up from being too tight, and thermal expansion differences can play a problematic roll) of an m12 bolt due to manufacturing tolerances. So as long as the bolt is within the tolerance range for an m12 bolt which is generally around 11.732 mm - 11.968 mm (as per this source:https://www.engineersedge.com/hardwa...ead-sizes1.htm). Every source is slightly different in the hundredths or thousandths of a mm range so nothing too major as the general range is the same. Also note if your bolt has a thread that is a bit more round instead of sharp this can impact major diameter measurements as well adding to the mostly benign variation that we see bolt to bolt, so again this shows how major diameter can fluctuate alot so you should not panic if your bolt is not exactly 12.00 mm or slightly smaller than stock. When we look at the measurements I took above my turner motorsports magnetic drain plug is at 11.90 mm so it falls within this acceptable tolerance range as well so no issues with this plug. My stock drain bolt is 11.77 mm, so even smaller than the Turner bolt, but again in the acceptable tolerance range. Right away this debunks the myth that smaller bolts cause issues. It is simply not true and likely the reason for stripped threads was the mechanic did not torque to spec properly, or did not clean the threads of oil which acts like a torque multiplier.What is more important is the pitch diameter which determines how much surface area of the thread makes contact with the oil pan threads, and this is verified via measuring minor diameter and major diameter and determining the average. Unfortunately the blades of my calipers were to thick to obtain the minor diameter of the drain bolt so I could not calculate pitch diameter. However I did perform a wobble test on both the stock and TMS drain plug. What the wobble test is - is that you thread in the bolt down the same number of threads and wobble it to see if it moves. If the bolt doesnt move it is extremely tight in the hole and this could mean the minor or major diameter was too large and is touching the drain pan threads too much preventing any wobble. Since we know that the major diameter is acceptable for both bolts the minor diameter is what we would be testing. The stock bolt did have some wobble and from what I determined so did the TMS bolt to the same degree. This obviously isnt super scientific but it did verify that nothing was out of spec to the point where there was alot of additional friction on the oil drain pan threads to where it would cause galling and potential stripping.I also did mesh the two drain plugs together as seen in the images above and you do not see any gaps meaning thread pitch was good (also verified by my thread pitch gauge).So in general if the major diameter is different than the M12 spec do not panic so long as the major diameter and all of the other diameters are within the acceptable range it is perfectly fine, remember when machining occurs there will always be minor error nothing is perfect when mass produced hence why a tolerance range exists. So dont panic if you see posts of individuals saying a smaller bolt is bad and will strip your threads (most likely their pan threads were either already fatigued, or it was over torqued, or cross threaded, or maybe their bolt happened to be defective who knows), the engineering side of things says otherwise so long as your bolt is in the acceptable tolerance range you will be fine.3) Thread pitch: This has also been a concern for alot of people. But with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug the thread pitch is the correct 1.5 mm as verified with my thread pitch gauge in the section 3 sub section 1. So you will not run into any issues with thread pitch when using the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug.4) Magnets coming loose: Ok this is only a concern with cheap magnetic plugs that rely on adhesives to hold the magnet in, because when the oil gets hot the adhesives fail and the magnet can come loose. Some cheaper plugs may use really weak adhesive and rely on the magnet to also stick to the metal plug, but the combination of poor adhesives that fail in high temperature situations and cheap magnets that loose their magnetic properties (as discussed earlier) at low temperatures will also cause the magnet to come loose. But honestly despite alot of research I did not see this issue too frequently.Now with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug it is fit into the body of the plug using an interference press fit technique. This means that the hole is smaller than the size of the magnet so the retention of the magnet is unparalleled compared to any adhesives and will not weaken over time, and you should never have a magnet fall out unless you crack it or damage the plug body. Now turner motorsports have also informed me that they performed alot of thermal simulations so that the different expansion rates of the different metals (the neodymium magnet and titanium plug) will not be able to cause the magnet to come loose even at temperatures higher than what the engine will see. Another benefit of titanium for interference press fits is that the metal is extremely durable and strong, so you wont have to worry about titanium fatiguing over time due to use and possibly stretching or deforming to the point where the magnet may slip out. So overall the magnet coming loose on this drain plug is a nonexistent issue.5) Hex head rounding off: This is a really rare issue but I have heard complaints of this online. This issue is mainly due to the hex on magnetic drain bolts being alot smaller and shallower  than the socket that youre supposed to use which creates alot of play, or the user using an imperial socket instead of a metric one. This combined with a soft metal like aluminium can eventually result in the hex being rounded off. But this is a non-issue with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug which has an exactly 17.00 mm hex as shown by my caliper measurements in section 3 sub section iii labeled hex size. The depth of the hex is also sufficient enough that when used with a 17 mm socket there is no play and the sect doesnt want to slip off the drain bolt (due to a lack of depth). Combine this with the fact that the plug is made of titanium means there is no chance that you will round the hex on this plug, youre more likely to strip the threads on the drain pan before damaging this hex.Additional stock drain bolt images:Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceOverall summary:Overall in my opinion this is the best magnetic drain plug currently available due to its titanium construction which should prevent any breaking issues from ever occurring. It also features the correct thread pitch and diameter as previously described so no thread stripping of your oil pan should ever occur. The magnet itself is also the correct type to withstand higher oil temperatures that your car may ever experience without loosing magnet efficacy meaning this magnet will always work and be able to stick to any metal particles in your engine. The magnet also has more surface area than its competitors. So all of these features literally make it the best magnetic oil drain plug available imo, there literally is nothing else that I could find that I would say even comes close to this plug. It also is a really nice cheap mod every bmw owner should get because it can also help protect your engine from experiencing any additional wear and tear from metal debris.\n\nReserved for future posts.\n\nWow. Quite the review for a drain plug.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDrKevM5Wow. Quite the review for a drain plug.Haha thanks!\n\nJust wanted to post an update, I just did my oil change today and I noticed that the magnet actually does pick up metallic debris. There was a small greyish layer of metallic sludge covering the head of the magnet that was easily wiped off. It wasn't a large amount of metal by any means - nothing to be concerned about, but it does show that these engines do have ferrous metal components inside that do wear (cam shafts, valvetronic shaft, valve springs, timing chain, etc). So these magnetic drain plugs do work, and aren't useless as many speculated.Another thing to note was my oil temps got to 106*C in comfort mode before I shut off the car to drain the oil. So it was extremely hot and the magnet didn't lose its magnetism showing that turner does indeed use a very good quality grade n42 type SH neodymium magnet.Overall it is a very solid product and I am happy to have it.\n\nThanks for the update.

I recall Bavarian Autosport used to recommend Dimple as \"the highest quality and strongest magnetic drain plugs that we have ever used or tested\".Yes I looked at dimple, but I personally chose Turner because of a few reasons:1) when you have a hollowed out bolt to fit the magnet inside, the chance of snapping is higher due to there being less metal and thus the bolt being weaker. You see this alot with cheap magnetic drain bolts, so I wanted a really strong metal and titanium is insanely strong.2) the TMS bolt uses a very high grade magnet that is also heat resistant just like dimple, I wouldn't be surprised if they were the same magnet type. But the difference is there is more magnet exposed on the TMS bolt meaning more effective surface area. This is another reason why I chose TMS.\n\nSome images of others using a magnetic drain plugA cheaper magnetic drain plug (being hollow makes them weak hence a strong metal is desirable):This shows magnetic wear metals are present in these aluminium engines.N54 drain plug:M4 drain plug, as you can see there are magnetic metallic shavings in these aluminum engines (crank is forged steel, same as the rods, cylinder walls supposedly have iron liners).\n\nSo, this is something you're putting in the engine oil pan in place of the standard steel bolt with copper seal washer - is the purpose to protect the oil pump, or?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftySo, this is something you're putting in the engine oil pan in place of the standard steel bolt with copper seal washer - is the purpose to protect the oil pump, or?You replace the factory drain bolt.

I just recently serviced my brakes so is it the same process with the power bleeder connected to the reservoir? You just plug in the bleeder nipple around the clutch and pump it?From what I understand (I havent yet attempted it myself) bleeding the clutch is a bit tricky. The clutch fluid reservoir is built into the brake fluid reservoir and istiny. This means its easy to introduce air into the system. DIY details and discussions here:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1646233\n\nCoincidentally I just had my brake fluid flush done by an Indy a few months ago….I didn’t know about the association with the clutch fluid until the following week…Had a little bit of FOMO that I didn’t ask about it being done at same time as the brake fluid, til I accepted that 1) my clutch felt / worked fine prior (and after)   2) the service seems to be tricky as mentioned above, and 3) I seriously doubt BMW is doing anything with the clutch fluid aspect with their free service.Figured maybe at around year 8 if I still have the car and need the brake fluid done again, I can ask about itBackground:2021, 20k miles, wasn’t done in time for BMW’s free 3 year service\n\nCongrats on the new car, MGM is fantastic color on these.I'd add air filters and cabin filter for R&R, and probably due for an alignment if it hasn't had one (dealership may have checked it or would do that for free).Make sure the brake job is done w/ ISTA (or equiv) that cycles the TCS system, so you really flush it, not just a typical bleed.  If you are DIY, there are aftermarket handheld devices that can do this, but it might be cheaper to pay a dealer if you aren't going to do a lot else with it.\n\nDo the engine air filter and cabin filter too.\n\nI am looking to change the waterpump for My F87 M2 (DCT 2017) and would like a Pierburg.I am at 93K km at the moment.Is it a good idea to only change the waterpump or should I also do thermostat?I am planning to also change the Mickey Mouse flange, because the coolant needs to be drained and refilled anyway.

So if it does fail your car won't over heat, it will just be over cooled. The only downside is you'll have to bleed the coolant again which is messy and no fun.Make sure to also do the water pump ground bolt:https://www.fcpeuro.com/blog/bmw-n55...lt-replacementThis is the pierburg pump part number you should buy: PIE-70288166011518635090 is the OEM BMW part number, which pierburg will label on their pumps. So the two pumps you listed are one and the same, also f87 n55 powered m2's use the same water pump - and so does the F series n55.\n\nOkay thanks!I did not know about the ground bolt, so thanks for that too.",

Also if you're pushing pretty hard on track maybe use some motul sport oil or 300v just for the track, again a UOA will tell you more. But that will depend, I personally think you should be ok with street oil if you're not extremely heavily modified - again a used oil analysis will tell you more.\n\nSo guys which oil you recommend nowadays for a OG M2 | N55 from 2018?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydutchm2So guys which oil you recommend nowadays for a OG M2 | N55 from 2018?I'm using Pennzoil platinum euro 5w40 - which is a reskinned shell helix ultra 5w40 if you're in Europe.Motul xcess gen 2 5w40 is also very good, same with mobil 1 5w40\n\nI'm a big fan of buying good enough oil and changing it more often.I've been buying the Castrol Edge 5W-30 Euro and 5W-40 Euro from Walmart.

    "title": "Motor Mount Replacement Experiences?",
    "content": "Has anyone replaced their engine mounts yet?My left motor mount released the hydraulic fluid recently, so I need to replace it. Since one failed, Im actually planning to do both mounts. I did some Google and YouTube searching to see if I could find a good DIY, but didnt have much luck for M2 or 2 series, and just a few 3 or 4 series results.Anyway, Im trying to decide whether I want to DIY or farm it out, and was curious if anyone has replaced theirs. If you have, what had to be removed to get to them? If just the charge pipe, belly pan, dust shield and/or fender liners, Im good with that, no big deal, but hoping not to go much deeper for access.I already have the mounts, the bolts for the engine to the bracket, bracket to the subframe, and nut for the mount to the bracket, in addition to both mounts and a set of Bimmerworld inserts to stiffen them up a bit and hopefully prolong this set of mounts. My M2 is primarily a track toy at this point, but Im not interested in urethane or solid mounts.Oh, and I also already have a hoist or engine support bar to get the engine up off the mounts.\n\nYou can watch turbo install videos to get an idea of what you generally need to do (on the passenger side). Most of the time people who install stage 2 turbos remove the passenger side motor mount to get access to the turbo. Other than that ISTA would also explain what you need to do.Also keep us posted if the motor mount inserts fit, I am not 100% sure if the bimmer world stuff will fit because the m2 has weird motor mounts: the left side is shared with the f8x m4, the right side is a unique p/n for the n55 m2. So I am not sure if the standard n55 will fit because neither motor mount is the n55 version, and I am not sure if the s55 one will fit because the right side is n55 m2 specific.\n\nHow old/many miles does this car have that the engine mounts have failed?Any mods that might have accelerated ageing?Probably best to also look at replacing the transmission/differential mounts while you're at it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyProbably best to also look at replacing the transmission/differential mounts while you're at it.+1When the motor mounts go, those are the next things in the drive line that gets beat up.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87source%snip%Also keep us posted if the motor mount inserts fit, I am not 100% sure if the bimmer world stuff will fit because the m2 has weird motor mounts: the left side is shared with the f8x m4, the right side is a unique p/n for the n55 m2.

Odd...Seems the M235iR stiffening ring fits!Confirmed that 22118416823 fits.\n\nThanksF87source, good tip on the turbo upgrade video. I’ll probably get a subscription to ista before I start, but I do a lot better with video than static instructions. Good info on the mount differences as well. I’ll give them a trial fit on the new mounts and report back.M Fifty- no mods, car was stock other than an intercooler and charge pipe. I noticed the mount had ruptured when I had the belly pan off to do the downpipe a couple weeks ago. I happened to do rogue trans mounts at the same time, so all good there. The mount does not appear to have separated, the fluid bladder has just ruptured.As far as contributing factors, the car has somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 track days on it. Also it’s a manual transmission and I probably have flubbed more than a few heel-toe downshifts (inadequate throttle blip) as I was getting used to the car. It’s a 2018 with 37000 miles and was on track for the first time 2-3 days after the 1200 mile break in service. This is the first mechanical issue I’ve encountered, so can’t complain.Thanks for the linkZeese, my search efforts didn’t turn up much, or perhaps I passed over this thread when I saw it was about poly mounts.Link to what I’m going to try;https://www.bimmerworld.com/Aluminum...2-E9X-F3X.html\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bybentom2%snip%Thanks for the linkZeese, my search efforts didn’t turn up much, or perhaps I passed over this thread when I saw it was about poly mounts.Link to what I’m going to try;https://www.bimmerworld.com/Aluminum...2-E9X-F3X.htmlThis is the part that did fit:Engine Mount Reinforcement Insert Ring - M235i/M240i RacingThe fitment list is a bit perplexing.

Seems the one you linked to ought to work as well!Thanks! Looks like the same design. I guess I bought the knockoff.\n\nDid you notice the car making any new noise due to this failed motor mount?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypablom2cDid you notice the car making any new noise due to this failed motor mount?I havent noticed a change at all. I have no idea how long the mount has been ruptured. I only knew because of the staining on the skid plate when I pulled it to install a downpipe and trans bushings.In fact, Im still driving with the ruptured one since I havent had a chance to change it out yet. Was targeting this weekend, but probably will be a week later.Good reminder to try mating the Bimmerworld inserts to the new OEM mounts I have on hand. Will follow up soon on that at least.\n\nFinally got around to replacing the motor mounts and adding the Bimmerworld inserts. The inserts fit the OEM M2 motor mounts without issue.We were able to get the driver side mount out, and the new one in without removing the motor mount to engine block bracket by removing the top nut and lower screws then lifting and jacking the engine. I’m glad as the brack to block bolts looked like they would require removing the charge pipe and I didn’t really want to fight with that today.Passenger side did require the bracket be removed, but the bolts are more accessible from below.Took us a half day, majority of which was removing and reinstalling the plastic drip trays, fender back half of the front fender liners, and skid plate. Aside from that stuff, everything went smoothly.The motor mount inserts did add a bit of vibration/resonance in a few spots.1) A slight rattle can be heard from outside the car with your ear near either front wheel2) a slight resonance is causing a minor rattle in the dash at warm idle.3) just off idle there’s some perceivable vibration through the pedals and a bit of a buzzy noise4) during u-turns at 5-10 mph there’s a bit of perceptible vibration through the seat and controls.However, while driving, I didn’t notice much of anything as far as noise, including sudden WOT near peak torque, sudden deceleration from high rpm, and WOT upshift a redline. Didn’t notice any new noises at a brisk pace on a twisty back road, either.It’s probably worth noting that my car has coilovers, some solid bushings, a cage seats, and harnesses, etc, so it was not exactly quiet to begin with. On a mostly stock car, I’d think hard about whether you need these. The noises probably could get old on a commute or mellow drive.I’ll be on a new to me track next week and will report back on what I notice in that setting. I might need to get to a familiar track in late September to have a good A/B though.\n\nUpdate after a day on the track. I’m aware the mounts are adding some vibration through the chassis and steering. Minor stuff but it’s present.Edit to add that a friend (@pal on here) found a similar urethane insert from Powerflex. He’ll probably get them installed soon and I’ll ask that he add his thoughts on them to this thread. I’m sure they’ll be quieter. Will be interesting to see what they do as far as stabilizing the engine. I’ll have to get back to a familiar track to get a better sense of that myself.\n\nThankstomthomasAgree on not putting this off. I replaced them shortly after discovering the fluid dried on the belly pan.Interestingly, I noticed no change in how the car drove. I only noticed the failure because I had the metal splash shield/pan off for another project and saw the black stain on the top side of the pan. So I guess my advice is to check your motor mounts if you track the car regularly.Also, looks like I never circled back with long term experience on the Bimmerworld inserts.I basically notice additional noise vibration in a few circumstances;1) at startup/idle and when moving the car around at parking lot speeds. This can both be felt and heard.2) a bit more vibration through the touch points while driving. This is pretty subtle.3) on track, I can feel and I think hear them in high speed/high rpm corners.The last point has me considering swapping them out for the urethane ones mentioned above.\n\nFor anyone who has installed the Powerflex motor mount insert (black / track), have you checked them lately? I just looked at mine after a few months of driving and about 10 track days and this is what I found:\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2guruFor anyone who has installed the Powerflex motor mount insert (black / track), have you checked them lately?

Zero increased NVH from them either.As a comparison I have Powerflex black engine & g/box inserts fitted to my Renaultsport RS275R track car & they have definitely increased NVH somewhat but have made a big improvement in getting power down.I also have Nolathane red engine & trans inserts fitted to my Golf GTI daily & whilst they have also made a noticable improvement they have increased NVH terribly to the extent Im now looking for an alternative brand.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2guruFor anyone who has installed the Powerflex motor mount insert (black / track), have you checked them lately?

Those Powerflex inserts were going to be my replacement for the aluminum ones.

It seems that there is barely enough clearance - barely meaning not really enough. I am not sure I trust my Harbor Freight engine support bar to hold all that weight. I already bent one of the tabs on the support bar. Right now I am thinking that I'll try to jack up from the bottom along the oil pan to block edge while I use the engine support bar, but I am not sure how that will go.

If you unbolt the engine mount bracket from the block, you can get the mount out without dropping the subframe.",

And I'd appreciate any advise based on my objectives.The question I have is should I replace the diverter valve at this time when I have everything apart???Here's my list of things I'll be doing as soon as all the parts come in:  (I'll be doing these myself, btw I can't imagine what it would cost of I had BMW do this for me)- [ ] Run Techron Injection Cleaner for one full tank of gas- [ ] Drive Car up to full temperature- [ ] Remove items from topAir IntakeCharge pipe top clampMickey Mouse flangeEngine coverCorner strut braces- [ ] Jack up car- [ ] Drain engine, trans, diff- [ ] Drain coolant- [ ] Remove coolant hoses- [ ] Remove all turbo hosesCharge pipeTurbo inlet pipeIntercoolerTIC pipe- [ ] Install Ti Engine drain plug- [ ] Refill mostly with engine oil- [ ] Remove and replaceOil filter with magnetic coverMussleman oil thermostatFill with oil- [ ] Fill Manual trans oil- [ ] Fill Diff oil- [ ] Bleed clutch fluid- [ ] Remove serpentine belt- [ ] Replace water pump ground bolt- [ ] Install Malo Crank seal plate- [ ] Install new Serpentine belt- [ ] Install new TIC hose- [ ] Install new coolant outlet hose/flange- [ ] Install new charge pipe- [ ] Install new intercooler- [ ] Install Turner Intake- [ ] Refill coolant- [ ] Bleed procedure- [ ] Lower car- [ ] Zip tie spare coolant expansion hose to original- [ ] Install new cabin air filter- [ ] Remove spark plugs- [ ] Disconnect injector connections- [ ] Bleed Engine Oil system: 3 starts 10 seconds each- [ ] New Spark plugs install- [ ] Install engine cover- [ ] Install new corner strut braces- [ ] Double check before starting- [ ] Check engine oil level1) If you zip tie the replacement coolant expansion hose to the existing one, make sure you cover the ends so no debris gets in it.2) What magnetic filter cover?3) Diverter valves can improve throttle response, so I'd do it while im down there.4) Don't use silicone grease on any O-ring sealing intake tracts or components going to the engine. Because silicone grease will coat the O2 sensors and damage them. Use engine oil, petroleum jelly, or my favorite super lube. Just make sure the O-rings are compatible with your lube (this is why I like super lube because it is very compatible with all sorts of materials), technically all O-rings seeing the engine will be nitrile, or viton anyways so you shouldn't have any issues.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAmuroRayPictures of the 911 SC?What intake did you plan to get?I'm getting the Turner intake.

I bought the malo industries crankshaft guard yesterday. The car has 78,000 kms and has recently changed the differential oil (with 58,000km), DKG engine and gearbox oil with 75~78kms along with the coolant tube and Micky Mouse hose (for other oem) and vacuum line. I think for safety I would only need a serpentine belt which I think costs about 40~60. I have already bought the crankshaft guard and perhaps it would be good to change the oil filter and thermostat gaskets which both cost 70, I don't know if anything else needs to be changed on the filter, screws etc.. perhaps later the oil filter cover, the coolant bleed screw and perhaps the most expensive ones which are the IC and CP DO88 which are about 1000 could be changed. I wanted to ask you, I'm zero in mechanics, literally a 0 haha, do the coolant bleed screw and the oil filter cover need to be bled or something to change or can you simply remove the OEM ones and put the screw and the filter cover just doing that (which I can do haha) thanks.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJohn wkI like your knowledge about this engine.

Then the oil filter cap is simply opening the plastic one and putting the aluminum one in and the brass coolant bleed screw more of the same, remove and tighten and put back..  I still need to do those updates along with the serpentine and the CP and IC... about 1300 I think the best way to know if you are with the woman of your life is to know if she can put up with these things jajaj",

    "title": "Tonight...Bit By The Infamous Coolant Return Hose",
    "content": "Update:  in actuality, it turns out that I was actually bit by the failed water pump ground bolt. This has been *known* failure point as the aluminum bolt that holds the ground cable to the water pump fractures, and you lose your ground and as a result, you lose your water pump.What mustve happened is that when the ground boat failed somehow the pressure backed up and blew out the coolant return hose, which was probably weak also.So I would highly recommend changing the ground bolt to your water pump with a stainless steel one which is very easy to do because its accessible and right under the pulley accessible from under the car.Original post:Well, I was prepared, but not well enough.My 40,000 mile 2017 OG M2 blew its Coolant Return Hose 20 minutes ago.  Im now waiting for a tow truck to get me home.  My wife in the car, not too happy about waiting an hour to get towed.I even have a spare hose that I was going to install parallel to the old hose, but failed to do so because I didnt like the looks of it.In case you dont know, this is the little hose that connects from the coolant return reservoir to the top radiator hose.  This is a 5 minute fix if you have the part.My advice, get an extra hose and zip tie to the original so you can get yourself unstuck when it does blow!\n\nRecommended coolant return hose replacement:  every 4 years.\n\nThanks for the PSA! How many miles did you have on that hose before it broke?Ever since reading this thread,I carry a spare one of these in my trunk at all times. I plan to swap it in when I flush the coolant system next year. Ill probably have around 49K mi on the current hose by then.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongWell, I was prepared, but not well enough.My 40,000 mile 2017 OG M2 blew its Coolant Return Hose 20 minutes ago.

I do have some things I would like to ask/say:1) Did your low coolant message come on to warn you about this, and how much coolant was left in the expansion tank when you pulled over?2) There is potentially a permanent solution for this issue, I recently saw it on facebook, but didn't have a chance to try it out for myself and if someone on here wanted to be the guinnea pig I'd be interested to see what the results are.- So you first need to buy this:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHFM22BJ...rOG=1&newOGT=1- Then you need to remove the fittings and buy some coolant compatable heater hose of the appropriate length. Then attach the fittings to that and it should be bullet proof now. Just make sure you don't kink the hose on the tight bends and make sure it doesn't rub on anything sharp.I can't share the post because it's on a private group but I will share their images (credit to Ryan Mans):\n\nMy coolant hose was the original, 7 years old, 40,000 miles.Traveling at night I could see smoke in my rear view camera, I pulled over before any warning indicators came in.Coolant on the expansion tank was empty.My son was able to come to my rescue with the extra hose, distilled water and coolant.  I quickly replaced the hose and coolant.  Concerned that I wouldnt have enough battery power left to do the bleeding procedure, I drove off.It started to over heat, so I stopped and tried to do the coolant bleed procedure, but after about 20 seconds of pressing in the gas, the pump would not come on.So I limped home keeping the water temperature under 250 degrees F, and the oil temp under 220 degrees F.Hopefully I didnt do any damage to the engine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongMy coolant hose was the original, 7 years old, 40,000 miles.Hmm Im at 7 years and 44K miles. Now Im wondering if I shouldnt wait until the coolant flush next year to replace the hose.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongMy coolant hose was the original, 7 years old, 40,000 miles.Traveling at night I could see smoke in my rear view camera, I pulled over before any warning indicators came in.Coolant on the expansion tank was empty.My son was able to come to my rescue with the extra hose, distilled water and coolant.

Having it break on the road is a real PITA as you have to refill with coolant/water and then bleed the system, which for some reason did not work for me doing the procedure, accessory on, heater on full heat with low setting on the fan and pressing on the gas pedal for way over 10 seconds.Limped home at the edge of overheating.  Fortunately, I could monitor the oil temp closely.Then I saw another video where the guy pressed on the gas for 5 minutes to make it work. I'll try that tonight to see if I can get the water pump going to bleed the system.  Either that or the pump did go off and I didn't hear it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongAlso, I just ordered the fix on Amazon.

What if it stays together while Im prodding at it and then it decides to pop on the next drive  I will have done it to myself.

    "content": "DTC 120308 Boost Pressure; Plausibility: too low2017 OG M2 threw this code after installing a Pure500. Symptoms included what felt like boost surge. Rolling into the throttle youd get hesitation and then power would hit. Almost like the wastegate was having a seizure. This showed up in data logs in the rpm and boost trace. Checking the wastegate calibration returned nothing. All healthy. Suspected potentially a warped wastegate flap.Code went away after clearing it and only returned once after that, in nearly the identical spot on the drive home.While I never smoke tested the car to absolutely id the root cause, it was totally resolved after upgrading intercooler and replacing the turbo to intercooler pipe and the charge pipe that came with the Wagner Evo3 I installed so its safe to assume it was a simple boost leak.Leaving this here as a clue for anyone that may have a similar issue in the future as there wasnt a ton of threads on this aside from a guy solving it by replacing a DV. He had other codes in conjunction though fwiw while I had this code on its own.Other attributes of potential interest:Transmission: 6MTPrevious charge pipe: Turner Motorsports (hard avoid)Prior Intercooler: CSFDV: GFB DV+",

Once the car gets warmed up after driving a while the rattles go away. Makes me think the rattles will disappear once warm weather gets here.We have had the coldest winter here in 24 years.

Not a constant occurrence however.I recently installed spacers but have yet to recheck torque specs so maybe related?

It's the rear deck. Taking it in to be serviced....I have a similar issue - going 40 mph or better if I hit a rough spot, etc. in the road a little tap noise occurs. Sounds like something at the top of the right rear suspension possibly. My dealer looked it over and the suspension is torqued as it should be in the rear. Currently 850 miles on the car, it started happening around mile 750 or so. Was on a nice country drive on perfect roads, didn't hit anything.I ran a test folding the rear seats down and I \"thought\" it went away. Got home and it started snowing a couple hours later, need to test more to confirm if that was it or not.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byBFLYI have the same rattle. It's the rear deck. Taking it in to be serviced....I have a bunch of rattles, only 1 fixed. The concrete street by my house has alot of 'small bumps' that causes the car to rattle all over. This is all low spd (20mph)1) Rear deck rattle - dealer applied felt tape to the rear deck area - rattle gone. Not sure where they applied it.2) Above center console (SOS button) rattle - dealer applied tape, no difference. I applied a bunch of felt tape and pads all around the area, slight difference.Took it back to dealer, they said nothing else can be done...basically concluding its a M car, stiff suspension and low profile tires = noise (boo)I will probably take the car in to a diff dealership on my next service and see what they can do.Franklin\n\nEvery BMW I have owned has creaks and rattles. Nothing is going to cure it.  What really bugs me is the windows making noise against the seals when its chilly out. Warm they are nice and quite.\n\nThe ASD fake exhaust noise also has rattles engineered in as well. Good news, when you code out or bypass the ASD all rattles go away.",

    "content": "OK, I promised several folks here I would post the UOA of Motul 300V, which did not have any track time this time.Racing oils like 300V are not the best choice for street use. But I had plenty of this oil (new formula, current one), and I did not have time to track the car. But that made me interested in how this oil does during daily driving. I know folks in other forums are interested in this, so share it with them.1. Oil did not oxidize at all. This is an exceptional oxidation result even for street oil, let alone racing oil, which is testimony to the quality of base stocks and polymers.2. This oil is packed with wear protection additives! ZDDP is really high, and I would say it is right at the border of being street-acceptable. Moly is also very high.3. Calcium is lowered in the new version to be more LSPI \"friendly.\"4. KV100 is really, really good. It is at 12.79cst, while it starts at 13.5cst. HTHS of this oil is 4.1cP. Such high HTHS, in relation to a relatively thin KV100 for W40, suggests extremely high-quality base stocks.5. N52 is not as hard on oil as N55, S55, etc. But it gives you an indication of how oil performs. This is UOA, not used engine analysis, so don't pay attention to wear metals, although they are stubbornly the same as was always the case. Previous samples, one 0W40, are interesting. 0W40 had A LOT of track time. And not any track time, but sessions as long as 1 1/2hrs without pit stops and at 5,100ft altitude at 102f ambient temperature. 0W30 is strictly daily in winter, a lot of skiing driving, probably 60% open road to ski slopes and back.6. I do drive my car hard, all the time! But, I don't think that is anything extra taxing on an engine, and these results show that.7. The copper level here is just a bit higher. But take into consideration that different oils, especially ones based on ester, leach metals differently.So, before I got this UOA today, I would suggest people check Motul Power 5W40 if the vehicle does not see a lot of track. Now, I believe this 300V is \"streetable\" oil.If you choose to go with it, do it at your own risk, as it does not have any approvals whatsoever, including API.\n\nThoughts on the silicon level?Also, 300v 5w-40 is as thin as most 0w-40. Always worried me for a 450-475whp tuned N55 seeing hard track time in the summer (plus daily driving), so I ran 10w-40 bc it’s still thinner than oils like Redline 5w-40.\n\nSilicone is low, but it is from VANOS bolt recall. Local dealership was replacing bolts so it got contaminated a bit.\n\nTBN is strong. The ZDDP is higher than I would expect since the new version is supposed to be mid-SAPS no?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719TBN is strong. The ZDDP is higher than I would expect since the new version is supposed to be mid-SAPS no?Yes, but just bcs. ZDDP is strong doesnt mean ash production is high. I think also Mid here is at the limit. Phosphorus is at the limit. I think it depends on the batch. Also, this oil doesnt have any approval, so Mid-SAPS is open to interpretation 😂\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolYes, but just bcs. ZDDP is strong doesn’t mean ash production is high. I think also “Mid” here is at the limit.True, but I've never seen a \"C3\" oil with more than like 850 ppm P.

This makes me feel better about using it in an older engine also to be honest.It just dawn to me that this oil doesnt have any approval. So, Motul can interpret Mid-SAPS anyway they want 😂. But, based on how oil held, I would trust them about ash production.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719True, but I've never seen a \"C3\" oil with more than like 850 ppm P.

I assume M1 or Castrol?5,000mls one is Castrol Edge 0W40 (lots of track time), and 4,600mls one is Castrol Edge 0W30 (\"German Castrol\") with no track but harsh winter driving.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byericoldi remembered ,experts telling me  for old batch 300v,dont go further than 2000miles using it,it will oxidise.now we see it going a lot more,thats good for street use.so my question is..if someone use it like you did,just for streetable use, is there any benefit vs other streetable,cheaper oils like m10-40 or castrol 0-30 or even motul xcess gen 2 5-40?also ,you have a disclaimer kind f at the end,do you think that will cause any trouble to my direct engine bcs  of more ash products? i know you explained about ash but we dont know yet..last , did you feel any drug from higher hths any time of the day? iknow motul gen 2 you used had a 3.8.So, the previous UOA of Motul 300V (old one) 0W40 after 5K that I have seen in Corvette C7 that was abused (literally) on track showed less oxidation than old Mobil1 0W40 (API SN) in the same vehicle (not mine). That Mobil1 had a bit of ester, so oxidation was higher from the get-go, but 300V had much more ester. So, oxidation in 300V was always under very good control for such type of oil.In this new version, PAO is increased, and ester decreased, which will help oxidation.Is there a benefit of driving it daily, no track? No, there is not. This is cheap UOA. It won't show deposit control, etc. Also, this oil has exceptional HTHS, which is dynamic viscosity measurement and will influence your mpg. You really don't need 4cP HTHS in the daily grind. It affects performance and mpg. On track, if you are pushing it really hard, yes, especially that very high level of ZDDP, which is the last \"line of defense.\"I ran this only bcs. I had a bunch of it sitting and was curious how it will do on the street and track. It turned out I did not have time for track days, and then I was even more curious about it. I refilled the engine within Castrol Edge 0W30 that I have been sitting for the last 3 years. Even for occasional track days, I would run street oil (that other UOA with 5,000mls, 0W40, is Castrol with a lot of track miles and sessions as long as 1 1/2hrs). Detergency and dispersants are going to be in abundance, and those oils are better suited for daily grind. The only thing I would pay attention to is that if street oil is tracked, to have Porsche A40 approval as that approval (otherwise nothing special) has a track test.However, if someone really wants this 300V, to feel warm around the heart, it is IMO OK to use it. If there is serious track time involved, this oil would be my first choice.\n\nHi Edy,I was offered a very good deal on Rowe Racing oil, 5W40 0W40 0W30 whatever viscosity I need they are all available. I can easily get 300V of course but just bit curious whether other racing oils has the same performance in terms of daily using? As you can see TBN is only 7.8 of this oil, my knowledge tells me a good daily using oil will deliver roughly 10 of TBN to maintain balance of the entire oil interval. Am I correct that this oil is absolutely not designed for street use?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySpiritbimmerHi Edy,I was offered a very good deal on Rowe Racing oil, 5W40 0W40 0W30 whatever viscosity I need they are all available.

As you can see TBN is only 7.8 of this oil, my knowledge tells me a good daily using oil will deliver roughly 10 of TBN to maintain balance of the entire oil interval. Am I correct that this oil is absolutely not designed for street use?So, most popular oils in Europe since 2009 have TBN, usually 5-7tbn. So-called low-SAPS oils. As you know, DPF in Euro diesel has been in cars since 2004. To have a long DPF life, Low-SAPS oils must be used. What does that mean? DPF regeneration burns soot but NOT ash. Ash is an oil byproduct and will eventually clog DPF, but lower ash-producing additives increase the lifespan of DPF. They also reduce intake valve deposits. However, less ash-producing additives mean lower TBN. That is not a problem as long as gas has low sulfur levels. So in 2009, the EU moved to up to 10ppm sulfur levels in gas, and gasoline engines started using these low to mid-SAPS oils. So, using lower TBN oils is absolutely fine as long as sulfur is low, as sulfur destroys oil additives. Motul 300V also has a lower TBN now, around 7.5-8. So, ROWE is nothing unusual. Oil companies moved to lower TBN bcs. IVD, LSPI etc. Your average C3 oil that people use in their diesel or gas engines will have TBN, probably around 6-6.5.ROWE is good oil. But it is impossible to know how it will behave unless it has some specification like API. If not, you can only know that if you do UOA but even then, you really don't know about deposits left behind. Like I said personally, I would always run street oil daily or if a little bit of track is involved. Street oils are tough. They must do a bunch of stuff: cold driving, short trips, grocery getting, etc. Racing oils are generally created for one purpose only. Lately companies make racing oils more flexible knowing people want them as they believe it will offer better protection etc. It is really marketing. If you look my UOA, from it 300V looks like good oil on street for some conservative OCI, like I did 5,000mls. But look Castrol 0W40! Street oil, 5,000mls, lot's of track time, and wear is not any higher than Castrol 0W30 without track or 300V.I also have UOA of Pennzoil Platinum Euro 5W40 (Shell Helix in Europe) and Motul X-Cess 5W40 GEN2. I was doing this project with Shell USA, and they did this comparison. Wear metals etc. will be different than Blackstone UOA bcs. it is a different lab. But, both had a lot of track time. Both are street oils. And both had 5,000mls on them. UOA is attached.So, what I think about that ROWE 5WS40? 300V is better. It provides same HTHS but out of lower KV100. That means base stocks are better. Also, the pour point in that ROWE is -36, which is pretty high, which means heavy base stocks and not as much PAO in it. Unless it is some crazy deal, I would skip it for 300V if you want racing oil.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byericoldhi chris,in a how older engine do you mean? and why is that? older engines need more than 850 ,bcs..?It should be fine but some like Porsche never allows back specifying, for example, so you are not allowed to use C40 in an A40 engine. I just typically feel more comfortable continuing to use full SAPS for old engines designed with A3/B4 in mind. BMW allows LL04 even in M52 so I am sure it's fine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolSo, most popular oils in Europe since 2009 have TBN, usually 5-7tbn. So-called low-SAPS oils.

The driveshaft is thicker where it needed to be installed. I ended up crudely milling mine to be wider and deeper, but it still didn't seat perfectly because of the tunnel shape.Overall, how it works is actually a great design, but for our cars the fitment is quite a ways off. I'd probably save your money on this one.Side note: I'd love to see someone fab something similar for our cars because it is an absolute PITA to keep the driveshaft from rotating while removing the diff nut. I also hate jamming a screw driver in the u-joint.",

Guys over on the M4 board say that BMW is aware of it and even though they can't do anything about it to go ahead and report to your SA.  They think if BMW gets enough complaints that they might do something about it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byProdigy.Is it quite a metallic clangy noise you guys are hearing? I have had it on a few occasions, only lasts for a second or so then stops.I'm glad to hear about this and the root cause not being something really serious.I have had it happen a few times on my M2 for very short periods (including yesterday), with it literally sounding like the muffler was dragging on the pavement, or a string of cans being towed behind the car.Before seeing this string I was thinking that perhaps this noise somehow related to a TSB for a loose stiffening plate some early production (like mine) cars apparently had, but I haven't got any sort of notice on this and don't want to bother bringing the car in to the dealer for this unless my car is specifically affected by this TSB, and the car is super tight and squeak/rattle free other than these very sporadic and short-lived disc brake stone issues....\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byTwixThis happened to me on the M Tour, the engineer with us said it's normal and to just push the shield to remove the stones. I didn't notice the sound much, but another guy on the tour noticed it when he was outside the cars while I was reversing.I found this video related to current generation M3/M4 cars (exact same brakes as our M2) that shows as the first item on the list exactly where this is happening and how to move the shields to free any stuff stuck there.Some of the other M3/M4 'problem's' addressed later in this video are interesting and likely relevant for M2's, such as the manual mode kick down feature - need to test that on my DCT M2, or entertaining (such as dealing with the 'poo sound' new M3/M4 cars make).http://www.autoevolution.com/news/te...50.html#agal_0\n\nGet a small pry bar and bend the shields back a bit, the rocks will fall out.\n\nThis issue may also be related to the recent differential recall. Here is a direct quote from my guys:Quote:\"My master technician suspects that the differentials may grow noisy with time, this is something the factory would only have noticed after some driving. Again, this is all just speculation. \"\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygmzanattaThis issue may also be related to the recent differential recall. Here is a direct quote from my guys:Doubt it. The brake dust shield and differential are quite different in location. BMW has nothing to hide on the issue, so if they say differential, it's the diff. If they had say a brake issue, this would be it.\n\nHappened to my M2 when I was driving it home after pick up from the showroom.As a mechanic I knew what it was and simply reversed the car for 30 or so meters and it was gone.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygmzanattaThis issue may also be related to the recent differential recall. Here is a direct quote from my guys:It's a different sound... it's not the diff IMO.  When you hear it on yours, you'll know what I mean.  Its a scraping, clangy sound and when you hear it outside the car, it sounds like it's coming from the wheel.I've had noisy differentials and this isn't the same thing.  A noisy differential will present itself when you turn (mostly in tight turns).  This sound happens randomly (turning, driving straight, hit a bump) and is a metal on metal screech... which is simply something caught in the dust shield grinding away until it dislodges.  The sticky PSS tires throw tons of crap up in the wheel wells and some get caught in the shields.  I had similar noises in my M4 too.If, in fact, it is the rear differential, then something is REALLY wrong and loose in thereP.S.  Given no one has any idea what the issue really is, the master tech is simply guessing at this point anyway.  He hasn't seen or heard the issue nor has BMW given any direction as to what it is.  Therefore, not sure his comment tells us much other than he has more knowledgeable speculation than our less informed speculation\n\nAs others have said, 90% chance it's a stone. Sometimes they get lodged in there really well. Try pushing the heat shield in multiple places, and also tapping on the heat shield with the handle (grip) of a screw driver.Worked for me. Driving forward and reversing a few times can also do it.Edit: Just realized I responded to an old post. I'mmmm dumb.\n\ni recently had this same problem, thought i might share my experience.  randomly started getting the brake scratching tin can noise on my m2 passenger rear, thought it might be heat shields and bent them back and cleared out any debris.  nope.  so i took the wheel/brake assembly apart.  what i finally tracked it down to was the parking brake assembly.  maybe it was due to a rock or something getting lodged, but regardless it was off center. so every time the wheel came around it would scrape just a little against the steel on the parking brake assembly. there is an adjuster on the parking brake you can turn counter clockwise to loosen the brake (read as make smaller in diameter) and then i re-centered the assembly by ear, ie reassemble and spin listening for scraping take apart and adjust again.  after several rounds of re-assembly and several aimless trips around town im noise free.  i imagine you down have to mess too much with the tension on the parking brake and can play more with the centering of the assembly but i never use my parking brake so it did make the whole project much easier.\n\nI had the same issue a while back - it sounded like I was dragging a piece of sheet metal behind the car, not to mention making it sound like the rear end was falling apart.  Having read about the pebble in the heat shield, I assumed that is what was causing the noise.  As the noise occurred randomly forward or backing, I finally pinned the noise down to one rear wheel.  Turned out to be a very small pebble lodged between the caliper and the disk, on the outside of the disk.  It was stuck in there pretty good, and took a screw driver to pop it out.  I was just thankful it didn't score the rotor.\n\nI think I have this. Noticeable at low speed with the window down. Sounded like rasping, steel on steel kinda scraping sound.I'll inspect the brakes tomorrow, really hope it is just this, I was so worried when I heard it.Another reason having an active forum community is so valuable.",

    "title": "Oil change maintaince correct timing?",
    "content": "So I got my car new 02/2019, got the first break in oil change 03/2019 but because the 2018 I got was in 2019 the computer kept showing go get another oil change despite having only 4K miles on it. So I got my second oil change 04/2019. I went recently to dealer to get my schedule maintainece but they said I'm not due till 7k more miles or April/2020? Is this correct? I tho it was 10k miles. I'm currently at 10100. I might go dealer again to ask another service advisor . Is there any additional service or things I need to look at after reaching 10k miles? I want to keep my car well maintained so I don't get issues later down the roads. Thanks\n\nYou dealer is correct. The 4/2019 oil change was one year from the date of manufacture.  Your next oil change started out at 4/2020 or 10,000 miles from the last oil change which ever comes first.  The mileage of 10,000 miles from the last oil change is changed depending on your actually driving conditions.\n\nRegardless of the computer, I've opted to change the oil and filter in my non-tracked M2 roughly every 5,000 miles and only use Shell V-Power fuel. I always change it right before it goes into my non-heated garage for the three winter month (insurance discount for non-use).For winter storage, I use the following:CTEK MUS-4.3 battery tender (no longer available) which appears to be the same one BMW markets under their own name. I also bought the CTEK Comfort Connect Extension Cable so the wiring could be fished down next to the manifold opening rather than closing the hood on the wiring.Wider tire racks due to rear tire size:https://bunkerwall.com/products/tire...vention-8-packWhen I originally took it in for an oil and filter change at 5,000 miles, it turned out to be free since it was within 3 months of the computer scheduled recommendation.If you can afford it, I'd say go for more frequent service intervals. It can't hurt and the records will help if/when you sell the car.\n\nChanging oil before the scheduled interval has zero impact on resale value. Synthetic oil easily lasts 10,000 miles or one year.\n\nExcerpt from Maintenance Schedule by Mike Miller of Bimmer and Roundel magazinesOnce BMW began paying for scheduled maintenance, lo and behold the schedule was revised. Now, magically, the cars hardly need any maintenance at all! The 1,200-mile break-in service was done away with except for M cars. Engine oil suddenly lasts 15,000 miles (dealers are supposed to use BMW synthetic oil).This is an alternative to BMWs factory-recommended maintenance schedule. It is not, Mike Millers maintenance schedule. It is actually BMWs maintenance schedule, more or less, which was used prior to Free Scheduled Maintenance. It also represents my opinion, based upon my experience and that of my readers, tech advisors, and professional BMW technicians both dealer and independent.Traditionally, BMW performed a break-in service at 1,200 miles on new cars, which included changing the engine oil and filter, manual gearbox oil or automatic transmission fluid, and differential oil. With the advent of Free Scheduled Maintenance, BMW stopped performing break-in services except on M cars.I have seen that the engine and driveline oils in new modern BMWs are literally full of metal at 1,200 miles  as has always been the case with any new car. For this reason, I recommend a 1,200-mile break-in service.Oil and Filter Intervals BMW recommends their Castrol 5W-30 synthetic motor oil in all BMWs except contemporary M cars, for which they recommend their Castrol 10W-60 synthetic motor oil. The factory oil change interval is controlled electronically, but is presently about every 15,000 miles. If you are running BMWs oil, I recommend an oil and filter change interval between 5,000 and 7,500 miles.\n\nThey don't use Castrol anymore. BMW uses Shell/Pennzoil now. I change my oil halfway through the cycle at 5,000 miles. I've heard all the pros and cons. Do what makes you sleep better at night. That goes for more than oil changes.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byRAM_F30_F87Oil and Filter Intervals BMW recommends their Castrol 5W-30 synthetic motor oil in all BMWs except contemporary M cars, for which they recommend their Castrol 10W-60 synthetic motor oil. The factory oil change interval is controlled electronically, but is presently about every 15,000 miles.10W60 does NOT go in these M cars, nor any S55 engine M car.  Oil change interval is 1 year or 10K miles.  This should be deleted as it is wrong.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCTSean10W60 does NOT go in these M cars, nor any S55 engine M car.  Oil change interval is 1 year or 10K miles.  This should be deleted as it is wrong.You are right 0W30 or 5W30 is the correct oil.\n\nI have a \"friend\" that's able to alter the Condition Based counter to get an oil change whenever he feels it's needed..Its his way of leveling the playing field and rebel against BMW's unreasonable maintenance schedule, for which he paid extra for.Of course,Ipersonally find this unethical but since my \"friend\" is the one who does this, I'm still going to get into Heaven..\n\nSo really my question is should I go and request and pay for another none schedule oil change? I do feel 10k is a lot of miles esp on a M car. I have literally only used shell vpower since I got this car in feb, I really want to maintain it for longevity. How much are these oil changes? And should I only do it at a dealer?\n\nI've run two used oil analyses on my BMW 0W-30 used in my 2016 M235 which runs a slightly detuned version of the N55 found in the M2 N55.  I drive somewhat hard and no track time.  I've gotten the free 1 year/10k oil changes but I've always done a change myself between the free change.  Per my UOA tests, the BMW 0W-30 is getting close to falling out of its viscosity spec at ~5000 miles.  Everything else was well within spec.  I wouldn't push the oil past a 6000-7000 mile change.  That's my plan after my last free change.\n\nMy second oil service is coming up next month. It will be less than 10k miles since it was done, but will have been a year. This is only my second brand new BMW, so the free maintenance is nice to have.What I don't like about these new BMW engines is there is no oil dipstick to actually look at the oil level. I'm a mechanic and kind of old school, so that takes some getting used to. I still haven't tracked my M2 yet so I know I haven't pushed the car that much.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byXutvJetI've run two used oil analyses on my BMW 0W-30 used in my 2016 M235 which runs a slightly detuned version of the N55 found in the M2 N55.

That's my plan after my last free change.This is great info, I just put 0W-30 in mine for the first time. Wanted the cold temperature protection for winter but was worried about the longevity. Did you ever test 5W-30?\n\nHere are some links about BMW oil recommendations. The first link informs that BMW uses Shell oil (Pennzoil).The second link is their oil recommendation for the M2 N55. The same oil is recommended for the M4 S55.https://www.shell.com/business-custo...-supplier.htmlhttps://www.shell.com/motorist/find-...NfRUZ0OFBuRFFWAvailable on Amazon Prime for $57. for a case of 6.\n\nAs has been stated in another thread, the Platinum Euro 0W-40 is LL-04 rated and not LL-01.\n\nPersonally I think the oil changing schedule from BMW (or lack their of) is pretty OTT. Everyone seems to disagree with me on this topic.As an engine's mileage increases it's friction from the piston rings to the cylinder walls decreases. An engine on 80k miles will have much, much less friction/ wear material from the metal & less stress on the oil; greater duration between oil changes at 80k. Add to the unmeasured conditions, poodling around at 30mph, against full throttle starts... ragging the hell out of it your duration has increased/ decreased.I changed oil at 10k up to 60k, after that I went to around 30k oil changes.BMW M2 Owner - 121,000 miles; self-maintained.\n\nNice to know how much safety margin they put in, but I'd like my rings to still be holding tight at 60k.  It never ceases to amaze me when people buy an M and then cheap out on parts and maintenance.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMaynardIt never ceases to amaze me when people buy an M and then cheap out on parts and maintenance.Yeah, especially when  at least in North America  you can get a full refund (less return shipping) on used oil and filter from places like FCP Euro.",

Technically if you do it by the book you should prime. But if you don't it'll only be a brief moment of oil starvation which might cause some wear but it shouldn't nuke your rod bearings nor engine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceSome oil does leak out but it does purge the entire loop.
