So service it often using products that need changing regularly.Now they are paying (at least in the US), they use longer-lasting products and change them less frequently.It's also worth noting that in the UK - where the customer is still paying - they specify the long lasting stuff and recommend 15k miles or two years for change intervals.Thats for road use only mind and the climate is less extreme (plus the fuel quality is better...)\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyIt's probably worth noting that - if the customer was paying - BMW were happy to help generate work for their dealership workshops.

Changing it more often is just a waste of time.If you have BMW Connect active your cell phone has the mileage or dates when all recommended service is due.  I do agree that lifetime fluids are a joke.  Once every two or three year to change the “lifetime fluids” is good.

Heat cycling to 270*F will degrade your synthetic oil.You do whatever you want, but if you take a look at every performance shop analyzing why bmws break down so much more frequently compared to other brands it is attributed to infrequent maintenance such as oil changes, fluid swaps, and using crappy parts like chinese oil filter elements.\n\nThey are still fully synthetic and not subject to contamination by combustion products so won't degrade at a significant rate. If you're subjecting the transmission to heavy use you want the fluid to trap the wear products and hence it's a good idea to change the fluid more frequently.But otherwise in normal use they are good for more than the 2 years of a non Life Time Fill fluid.As I mentioned elsewhere, I changed the Life Time Fill fluid on my superannuated E46 at 150k miles and it made a significant difference to shift quality (the colour of the stuff that came out was soot black), but it was still working - and continues to do so some 5 years and 30k miles later using just regular MTF fluid changed every couple of years.Once more, HTH.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDanGDiff and transmission fluids are considered lifetime fluids.

I will also go over the particular use cases and benefits of this jack stand and why I think they make this jack stand one of the best if not the best jack stands on the market. I will also compare these jack stands to other alternatives like ramps and the quick jacks, and contrast and compare the pros and cons of these alternatives. I will also go over the BMW Jack pad adapter for the Rennstands as well.So if you are interested in purchasing the Rennstands heres are some links to do so:Rennstand:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ece-p252276669BMW Jack Pad adapter:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p255054561Disclaimer:Damage/Injury Disclaimer: Any information, guidance, technical advice, coding advice, tuning advice, datalogging advice, installation instruction, calculation, experiment, safety information, or product installation demonstrated in my reviews is to be consumed/read/understood/followed and or done at your own risk. I will not be responsible/held liable for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Monetary disclaimer: I do not make commission, or profits or any kind of monetary gain from the sale of the Rennstand or the BMW Jack Pad adapter for the Rennstand.Sponsorship disclaimer: The way my reviews work is that I determine what product that I want to buy and actually use on my own car, and during this process the product that I end up choosing is what I believe is the best option on the market. I then reach out to the company offering the product and ask them if they would be willing to sponsor me in a review, if the answer is yes then I write a review, if the answer is no I would end up buying the product (sometimes at a later date) but I wouldnt complete a detailed review about it (I might write something, but not to the same extent as my standard reviews). But the critical thing is that I reach out for a sponsorship and not the other way around, this means that the products I am reviewing are actually things I believe in and would use on my own car. This also means that I am not being paid to review something I do not care about. Would I do a review if a sponsor reached out to me? The answer would depend on if I believed in the product, and I would make it clear in my review if this were the case. But at the time of writing this review, such an interaction has not occurred yet.Time of writing disclaimer: everything I am writing about in this review is described at the time of writing and may not be updated in the future, so there is a potential that things are no longer accurate in my comparisons as parts are changed and upgraded as time passes.Bias and comparison disclaimer: Throughout this review I will attempt to be as unbiased as possible while drawing comparisons to other products.Mistakes and Inaccuracies Disclaimer: Throughout my review I will try to be as factually accurate as possible, but there are always chances that I make mistakes and write things that are incorrect/false. If this is the case please point it out to me and if indeed it is true that I am incorrect, I will correct these mistakes and apologize for them. Afterall I am only human, so mistakes can and will inevitably happen.Subjective Disclaimer: Please note, these reviews are also written in my own opinion, so when I am comparing different products to determine what I see as the best, there are many factors that I go through to form this opinion. Obviously there will be disagreements between people, so I will do my best to objectively determine what I deem to be the best, but at the end of the day it is still just my own opinion whether it be right or wrong. Take whatever I say in my reviews with a grain of salt.Information Disclaimer: I read a lot of material over the years just out of sheer interest or to make these reviews. I also accumulated a lot of knowledge over my many years of education that are really relevant to cars (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics). That being said, my reviews are mostly based on this accumulated knowledge and I cannot always cite these sources due to the original source material possibly being lost to time, or there being so much knowledge compiled to make a single point. So, when possible I will cite my source(s) (for example data on tensile strength of a metal, or peer reviewed research). There are cases when I get information from blog posts, youtube videos, or forum posts I may not cite it, because I go through a lot of these sources only to use the gained knowledge in a small section of my review and it is not feasible to list them all. So pretty much what I am trying to say is I am not citing common knowledge - I will cite peer reviewed research and photos though (if applicable or used), or really explicit user experiences (if applicable or used).Image Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the respective image owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.Review Disclaimer:First and foremost I would like to thank ETA MFG for agreeing to sponsor me for this review. Despite this I will remain as unbiased as possible during the review. Please note, the dynamics of this relationship was that I reached out for a sponsorship review and not the other way around. This should demonstrate how I truly feel about the Rennstand - in the sense that I truly believe it is the best jack stand on the market, and a suitable alternative to the quick jacks. In fact I actually I am actually using these Rennstands to install all of my mods and do all of my services in 2024, and I likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.What Are Rennstands, and who makes them?:So lets begin by discussing what are Rennstands? The best answer to that revolves around Rennstands own motto: One Jack, One Jack Point, Rennstand - essentially Rennstands are jack stands that can be disassembled and used to lift a car at a specific jacking point, then once the car is lifted the Rennstand can be reassembled and left there while the jack is removed. The end result is a jack stand that can support the car right at the point it is lifted from - meaning you no longer have to jack the car up at the jacking point and look for a suitable place on the chassis to leave a jack stand (not always suitable on cars with alot of underbody panels - such as BMWs). This is also the most optimal and ideal place to put a jack stand, since vehicles are technically only meant to be lifted and supported at the jacking point - and manufacturers did not intend to have the car lifted by a jack and supported elsewhere by a jack stand. Manufacturers only really intended for cars to be worked on via post based lifts (the stuff you would find in a shop) which lifts and supports the car right at the jacking point, and thus the Rennstands are really the only jack stands on the market that can fulfill this requirement (every other jack stand requires you to jack on the jacking point and shove the jack stand somewhere on the frame).Heres a video briefly going over using the Rennstand itself:Next I would like to discuss who makes the Rennstands, because as you may have noticed there seems to be a lot of different vendors and variants out there.So, the Rennstands were actually created by Frank Ceravolo a Porsche owner on Rennlist (username: gyrfalcon) in mid 2016 with the goal of trying to create a jack stand that could be placed exactly where the vehicle manufacturer intended for the car to be supported - i.e. the jacking point and not on some random part of the frame. His goal was also to make the Rennstands light weight, extremely compact, easily transportable, height adjustable and low profile to fit under really low cars. After creating this initial design, Frank had his design rigorously tested by an engineer at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University for strength and durability. After the designs were tested he was able to obtain patents protecting the design.Now fast forward to production and these patents were licensed out to various vendors to facilitate production and sale of the Rennstand and thats why you may have seen several different vendors selling the Rennstand. Initially they were made by safe jack - but they are no longer selling or making the Rennstand, now Rennstand Inc (I think this is Franks company - but I am not sure) is currently manufacturing (made in the USA) and selling the original design of the Rennstand along with ETA MFG who are manufacturing (made in China) and selling what they call Rennstand 2.0 (under licensing from Frank) which is a modified version of the Rennstand (and imo an improved/better version that fixes some of the gripes I had with the original one - and I will explain why later on). So that basically sums up the history of the Rennstand and who is authorized to sell a legit version of the Rennstand (currently it is ETA MFG with Rennstand 2.0 and Rennstand Inc with the original Rennstand) - that has been engineered and tested to be safe, unlike any knock offs you may find online.If you want to see some sources here are the links:Heres Franks initial thread:https://rennlist.com/forums/993-foru...-new-idea.htmlHeres Franks first intro thread :https://rennlist.com/forums/987-foru...che-owner.htmlHeres ETA MFGs thread talking about Rennstand 2.0:https://www.etamfg.com/rennstand-ii.htmlAlso I wanted to include a small excerpt about who ETA MFG are - because if you judge them by their website and not go in depth reading about them you may not get the full picture of exactly who these people are and might not feel reassured buying their products (I have heard people say who are these guys, why buy the Rennstand from them they didnt even design it so why trust them to make it etc). Well ETA MFG is actually a manufacturing powerhouse with a factory spanning 1.6 million SF built-up structure on a 50 acre campus, and they specialize in manufacturing private label products for the global market. So pretty much you design it, they will manufacture it for you. But in the case of the Rennstand and the Mylift stand, they not only manufacture it but they resell it for you as well.Traditional Jack Stands:Credit: Canadian Tirehttps://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/m...jack+stand#srpNext lets talk about traditional jack stands. Now I have nothing against traditional jack stands, they serve their purpose well and are very safe for use on vehicles with large tubular frames or pinch welds that can be used to support the weight of a vehicle. Plus they are cheap, easy to use, portable and easy to store since they are so small. However on modern day BMWs I personally think jack stands with the claw style saddle are absolutely horrible - and lets talk about why.Credit: KC Designhttps://www.tw-kcdesign.com/upload/i...3%E5%9C%96.jpgThe first issue is placement (as you can see above this is an underbody image of the F87 M2 (representative of the F8X Chassis) and the F2X M235i (representative of the F2X and F3X chassis)):On the rear of the F8X chassis you could put the jack stands on the rear subframe, but there arent any good areas at the front of the car given you use the jacking points to lift the car. You obviously cant put jack stands on the suspension arms (tension arm, lower control arm, thrust arm) as they arent made to take weight and you risk damaging them. You cant put jack stands on the stiffening plate as that might need to be removed and its a weird flat shape which isnt a super good place to put a claw style jack stand (or you might have to remove the plate entirely for servicing), and obviously you cant put it on the floor panels as itll punch straight through and damage the sheet metal underneath. So there really isnt any good place to put jack stands on the F8X except the rear subframe. On the F22 since the rear subframe isnt as aggressive as on the F8X it becomes even more difficult to place jack stands.Credit: .Slughttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1854652The next issue is with the claw style design:Now if you wanted to place the jack stands on the jacking points youd need a flat top jack stand like ESCO in conjunction with aluminum jack pad adapters, because placing traditional claw style jack stands under the plastic jacking points will cause them to break over time - plus the plastic was not meant to bear weight so you also risk the car collapsing if the plastic fails. Traditional claw style jack stands also dont have a large enough surface area to hold a jack pad adapter in a stable configuration, so you risk it slipping off if you try to stack a jack pad adapter onto the claw.Credit: chiefsubjugatorhttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...6&postcount=32The final issue is choosing a location to jack from - and this applies to all jack stands:Youd also need to jack from the front and the rear center jack points, on an F2X and F3X vehicle you can do so fairly stably via the front center jack point and the rear differential. On an F8X vehicle you can jack the front up via the front center jack point without issue, but the rear must be jacked up using the rear subframe. Now this poses a bit of risk because the central part of the rear subframe is extremely close to the differential meaning only a small part of the jacks saddle can make contact with the subframe so it is very risky as the car can slip off the jack (as you can see in the image above). You can choose to jack from the side protrusion on the rear subframe, but that can pose instability issues as you try to lift the entire rear end of the car up while being closer to one side vs. the other.Now something I did not mention is jacking from the front center jack point is a massive pain, since the front center jack point is so deep under the car you require a special lower profile extended length jack - otherwise you will need to first jack/drive the car onto blocks of wood for additional clearance. Then the next issue is pumping the car up, since the clearance between the front bumper and the floor is so small your jack handle literally can only move inches at a time, and it takes forever to jack the car up from the front center jack point and this is a major pain to deal with.Overall the cons of jack stands revolve around placement, compatibility with the factory jacking point, and time consuming and tedious nature to lift the car up onto said jack stands.Ramps:Credit: F87SourceNow lets quickly talk about Ramps - this is another traditional way to raise the car up to a working height. This personally was my favorite method of working on my m2 (until the Rennstand) - due to its unparalleled stability (since the car is sitting on 4 massive contact patches and due to the fact that cars were designed to sit on their wheels for the life of the car), extreme affordability (Rhino ramps are extremely cheap), and due to their weight build and ability to be stacked - they are very easy to store. Ramps also allow for realistic suspension tuning by putting preload on the suspension - something quick jacks or jack stands cannot do. So these are all the reasons why I loved my ramps, however there are still massive flaws, so lets talk about them.The first issue is lifting the car:Most ramps are way too tall for the more sporty models of BMW to just drive up on, especially when you want all 4 wheels to go up at the same time - meaning the rear ramps have to already be underneath the car for you to drive up onto them at the same time as the front ramps. This means your only option is to jack the car up onto the ramps (the exceptions are race ramps but they are quite expensive, and for the price you might as well just buy Rennstands). Now the issue with jacking the car up onto Ramps is that you need 2 jacks - one for each side of the car so you can raise the car onto the ramps in a level manner. This is a massively time consuming process as you have to pump one side of the car up little by little to ensure it doesnt flip, and if one of your jacks are too short (like mine is in the image above) you need to prop it up on 2 by fours and move all that wood to the next wheel along with your jack. It is also extremely risky and dangerous, because the front wheels on RWD BMWs do not have any parking brakes. This means when you have to jack the rear of the car up on ramps first as you can still chock the front wheels while theyre on the ground, and the rear wheels are safe to be on the ramps first as they have parking brakes. Then you have to carefully jack the front wheels up on ramps afterwards. To make this process safer you should get a brake pedal depressor tool like I have. But this is still extremely tedious and time consuming.The second issue is you cant do anything that requires the wheels to be off:This means if you need to do brake jobs, wheel rotations etc. Your ramps are completely and utterly useless - which is why I wanted to upgrade to Rennstands for my primary mode of supporting the car, and have the ramps for suspension tuning.The final issue is adjustability:The final issue with ramps is the lack of adjustability, ramps are one height and thats it. You cant go lower and you cant go higher, and that is an annoyance if you want to work in the engine bay while it is on ramps. It becomes a bit of a challenge to reach deep down into the engine bay when the car is high up.So these are the reasons why ramps are not completely ideal for working on your car.Quick Jacks:Credit: Driver87https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...95&postcount=9Finally I want to talk about the Quick jacks. These are very very nice pieces of equipment, they allow for the car to be lifted via the press of a button - so no more pumping up jacks. They lift front and rear and left and right simultaneously so it is one and done, no need to worry about the front and then the rear and vice versa. The quick jacks also allow for a 24 lift height which surpasses all jack stands and ramps by quite a big margin iirc. But there are always drawbacks to everything, so lets talk about it.The first issue is price:Quick jacks are insanely expensive, they retail for $1500 USD + (and that's for the cheapest model). For that price you can buy ~3 sets of Rennstands, ~15 pairs for Rhino ramps, and ~30+ pairs of conventional jack stands. So it is not cheap and thats always a huge drawback for a lot of people, since it becomes a money issue. Now before I hear you own a BMW you should be able to afford quick jacks, dont forget these cars are rapidly becoming older and more accessible to more and more people, so money is always going to become a factor eventually. Plus its a BMW, theyre relatively affordable for sports car sake.The second issue is Size:Quick jacks are quite large at 60 +, and quite heavy at 60 lbs + for the frame itself and 15 lbs for the motor. So this makes portability and setup a concern, so if you have a small garage or a space constrained garage storing these quick jacks and setting them up and taking them down to store some place else might become tiresome as they are heavy and bulky. This is one of the main restricting factor for myself, since my garage is full of stuff and I dont have room for quick jacks (I have 3 cars in my garage, bikes, a lawn mower, snow blower, leaf blower, tools, air compressor, etc - so unfortunately there is no room for quick jacks in my garage). This is an even larger issue if you live in a house without a garage (apartment, condo, townhouse etc) and you cant constantly carry the quick jack into and out of your house. For most people the size and weight are deal breakers, and this unfortunately is my issue.The Final issue is maintenance:Like with most hydraulic power tools you have to maintain them to ensure they work properly. You have to ensure that the quick jack frames stay clean, you have to ensure the hoses and quick disconnect fittings stay clean, and you always have to watch for leaks and inspect the locking system. You also have to bleed the system occasionally.So this is a minor hassle that must be dealt with, and doesnt make the quick jack a true set it and forget it system (unlike mechanical systems like ramps or jack stands) and this might be annoying to some.Rennstands:Now onto my discussion of the Rennstands.Unboxing:First let's start off with the unboxing so you guys will have an idea of what you are going to get, since I dont see too many unboxings of the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo the first 3 images show the box that each individual Rennstand comes in, and they are actually really small overall (even smaller than a pizza box but just a bit thicker), however each box is quite heavy at ~25 pounds. The ETA MFG box itself was also double boxed and contained within the outer USPS box.ETA MFG also have duty free shipping to Canada and the USA so if you are in those locations, you will be glad to hear it will arrive to you without the worry of paying duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (and take it from me a guy who buys a lot of stuff from the US, brokerage fees from UPS often cost 2-3x as much as the shipping itself and that really sucks). My package was also shipped via Canada post, and arrived to me in ~4 business days, which is absolutely excellent, and the package arrived as if it were brand new so shipping was good and packaging was excellent.Credit: F87SourceThe next image shows the Rennstand box opened up, you will notice it is packaged excellently - I cant even begin to describe how good this packaging was - it must be the best packaged item I have ever purchased in terms of car parts. Now let me explain, the box itself has a wooden frame going around its circumference, this prevents the heavy weight from collapsing the box and prevents the box from being dented in and damaging the Rennstands. Next each item in the box was individually bagged, and parts that would touch were covered in cardboard, there was also a wooden divider separating the solid metal kegs from the rest of the box to prevent damage. Loose items like the pins were put in a bag (the pin one to the right of the image) and wrapped with foam and then tied down. Also critical voids in the box were filled with styrofoam or cardboard, and as a result there were ZERO rattles or movement in the packaging and that meant the Rennstands arrived in essentially excellent condition. So props to ETA MFG on packaging - I am thoroughly impressed. The only con was how long it took to unpack everything haha, but better that than having all of my stuff arrive damaged.Credit: F87SourceSo in this image above you will see everything in the box laid out: Feet, legs, saddle, jack pad, and pins.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNext are images of the Orange feet that these Rennstands come with, and they are very well built. All the welds look good and the side of the feet themselves are very wide - which results in very good stability.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNext are images of the saddle, as you can see the saddle can be removed from the rest of the Rennstand and be used to jack up the car. It also has a hole on top to allow various jack pad adapters to be attached to it.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNext are images of the pins, these are solid steel pins with a spring loaded ball at the end to keep it in place when clipped into the Rennstands. You get 4 pins per stand, 2 to connect the saddle to the legs, and another 2 to connect the legs to the feet. Each pin has a key ring on it to allow for easy removal even when wearing gloves.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNext are images of the jack pad adapter that is included with the Rennstand, it is just a standard pinch weld adapter, and comes with a large washer to distribute the load more evenly to the saddle.Credit: F87SourceFinally the last image is of the legs, and they are solid steel - not tubular like other versions of the Rennstands. I will talk more about these later on but they are very hefty for their size and are absolutely solid.Instructions Manual:Next I wanted to share the instructions manual for the Rennstands, because I dont think its available online and sharing it will allow anyone that wants to read it the opportunity to do so. Also, having it archived online will help anyone who has lost their instructions.View post on imgur.comTechnical Details:Now lets move onto the technical details.1) Base: The first thing I would like to talk about is the base of the Rennstands, because the stability of a jack stand comes from its base.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceIf we look into the size of the feet, my measurements have these feet at ~22.5 cm long, and the feet are ~4.76 cm wide (as per ETA MFG). The distance between the feet is ~33.33 cm in its lowest setting but increases to ~39.6875 cm in its highest setting (as per Rennstand) - this means as the stands get higher the base gets larger which adds to its stability. These dimensions give the Rennstands a very large footprint and base, making it incredibly stable overall. In fact I tried to test the stability of these jack stands by pushing on my car quite hard (well over 100 lbs of force) and there was no sign of movement or wobbling from the Rennstands. I also tried testing stability without any load on the Rennstands and they are pretty hard to push over. Another thing to note is that the Rennstands have pretty large flat feet - meaning it is going to be more resistant to sinking in softer ground, for instance asphalt when it gets very hot. The larger feet also do a better job spreading load across a larger surface area, meaning it is less likely to crack thinner concrete garage floors. Note: it is not recommended to use jack stands on anything but hard solid level ground.Now if we compare that to a traditional jack stand like my 2 ton AC Delco, they have a base of ~16 cm X 17 cm, so significantly smaller than the Rennstand. This leads to less overall stability, and why it was easier to push over when unloaded. The traditional jack stands also have smaller, very narrow and sharp feet, which means it will be more likely to sink on softer surfaces or damage the ground it is on.So overall we can see the feet and base of the Rennstand gives it tremendous stability compared to traditional jack stands despite its narrow appearance. Its wide feet also give it the ability to resist sinking and cracking the ground it is on, as it is able to spread the load over a larger surface area.2) Height and Access: The Rennstand has a maximum lift height of ~41.95 cm, which is comparable to the ESCO shorty jack stand (~43.18 cm) and other typical jack stands (they are taller than my no name certified jack stands, but are shorter than my moto master jack stands), and they offer significantly more underbody clearance than my rhino ramps. Compared to quick jacks they fall far behind, as quick jacks offer a lift height of ~60.96 cm.So overall access to the underbody is comparable to other jack stands, is greater than traditional ramps, and is less than quick jacks. However, the one major benefit of jack stands, Rennstands, and ramps over the quick jacks is side access to the underside of the car. This allows anyone easy access to the middle of the car by crawling from the sides of the car rather than from the front or the back - which you must do when using quick jacks as the massive frames take up the entire side of the car. So if you need to do a transmission oil flush, it is much easier to access the car from the side while holding a bottle of fluid with a pump sticking out from the top, vs. trying to crawl from the front of the back. Its also much easier to perform work that requires constant access to the middle of the underbody by going through the side vs. the front or the rear - for instance a clutch delay valve delete or short shifter install where you constantly have to go under the car to access things.3) Solid Steel legs: I would also like to discuss the legs that come with these Rennstands, and how they are solid steel bars and not hollow.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceAs you can see in the images above, the legs on the ETA MFG version of the Rennstands are completely solid metal, they are not hollow nor tubular unlike the original Rennstands - pictured below:Credit: starastronomerhttps://www.youtube.    com/watch?v=xj36YbaSljs&t=754s(remove the spaces if you want to see the video, I just put spaces so it wouldnt embed the video into the post)Now what this should mean is that the ETA MFG version of the Rennstands are going to be significantly stronger than the traditional Rennstand with their hollow legs, and that you can rest assured that these legs will be able to handle the weight of a car without an issue. There is no way that these legs will shear, bend, or have the pin holes fail when used under the rated weight limits. Like if you ever had the chance to hold these legs you would be able to feel how hefty and rock solid they are. They literally contribute the bulk majority of the weight to the overall Rennstand.So overall based on just the legs alone, the Rennstand 2.0 must be the strongest version of the Rennstand.4) Side Leg Removal: The ETA MFG Rennstand allows for the legs to be removed from the sides (pulled out to the left and the right of the saddle) vs. having to removed from under the saddle like on traditional Rennstands.Credit: ETA MFGhttps://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ece-p252276669Credit: F87SourceCredit: ECS Tuninghttps://www.ecstuning.com/b-rennstan...nd/18mrs3~rst/Credit: ECS Tuninghttps://www.ecstuning.com/b-rennstan...nd/18mrs3~rst/As you can see from the images above, the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand has legs that remove from the sides, whereas the other versions of the Rennstands have legs removable from the bottom. This means you have to lift the Rennstands a lot less to fit the legs in place compared to the alternate version.5) Material: The Rennstands are made from very strong carbon steel, and are electrostatically powder coated orange. This allows the Rennstands to be extremely strong, and well protected from corrosion.5) Jack Size: The Rennstands saddle has a jacking point of ~3, so you must have a corresponding floor jack with a saddle diameter of 3 or more so it can properly lift the Rennstand.6) BMW Jack Pad Adapter: The Rennstand has a variety of attachments for its saddle, one of which is a BMW specific jack pad adapter.https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p255054561Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo as you can see in the images above this is the BMW specific jack pad adapter, it also has a slot in the middle to double up as a pinch weld adapter for Dodge vehicles. Ive tried this specific adapter on my own M2 and it fits perfectly in the plastic jack pad, and has sufficient height to clear the sides of the adapter so it doesnt damage it. It also is tall enough to clear my rear M performance winglets - which sits right next to the plastic jacking point.7) Additional Jack Pad adapters: The Rennstands also have a variety of jack pad adapters that you can choose from. For instance they have a really cool saddle adapter:Credit: ETA MFGhttps://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p251403769That should be large enough to fit aluminum jack pad adapters for BMWs, incase you would like to use your existing jack pad adapters instead of the ones ETA MFG makes. You can also use this to put hockey pucks on it for use on the front center jacking point, and so much more. So this saddle adapter really opens up new possibilities.They also have flat top adapter pad for use on subframes, and they have honda, audi, tesla and porche specific pinch weld adapters as well if you want them.8) Price: The ETA MFG version of the Rennstands are ~$149.99 on sale (im pretty sure the sale is very frequent so it is almost a regular price), making them cheaper than the alternate versions of the Rennstands. So its a huge benefit that IMO the best version of the Rennstand is also the cheapest.9) Portability: Finally the last thing I would like to talk about is the portability of the Rennstands, since they can be dismantled into very small components, they are very portable and easily stored anywhere. This gives it a major advantage over traditional jack stands and even the quick jack - since these Rennstands can easily fit in the floor well on the passenger side, under trunk floor liners, in the back seat floor well, and can be easily stored in very smaller areas like under the stairs.Testing:Finally I would like to talk about load testing on the Rennstands, since this is a pretty important aspect for safety. Note: Everything im going to be talking about only applies to the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand, not the other versions you may find out there.So the ETA MFG Rennstands are rated for 3 Tons per pair under the ASME/PALD certification standards, which are more rigorous than the ANSI testing rules used by the alternate Rennstands and this is also why the weight ratings are done in pairs. However, when tested in house the ETA MFG version of the Rennstands were capable of holding over 6 tons each - but legally they were only able to rate it at 3 tons per paid as thats what the lab testing under ASME/PALD yielded.So rest assured that these Rennstands should be able to hold any BMW ever made without issue, and you will be safe while working underneath a car supported by these stands (given you are using them properly and within their rated weight).Rennstand in Action:Now lets take a look at some images of the Rennstand in action holding up my M2:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceAnd here are some images showing underbody height (specifically under the front bumper) when supported by the Rennstands:Credit: F87SourceFinally here is an image of how high it can lift the M2 as measured from the jacking point, and the result is ~43.5 cm.Credit: F87SourceAnd lets finish off the images with some pictures of the Rennstands when they are fully assembled:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceNow finally let me go over some additional things I noticed when using these Rennstands on my own m2:1) Lifting Height: These Rennstands actually lift the m2 a surprising amount, as a result I am getting a lot more underbody clearance compared to my ramps and it makes working under the car and getting under the car a lot easier.2) Stability: I tested the stability of these Rennstands by pushing on the tire with considerable amounts of force (easily over 100 lbs) and the inside of the door panel to simulate lateral force along the centerline of the car and there was no movement or rattles/noises from the Rennstands - they were rock solid. This is extremely confidence inspiring especially since I will be using these for suspension work which requires torquing the lower control arms to ~130 ft lbs.3) Ease of use: The Rennstands were really easy to set up compared to my ramps, and literally only required a few pumps of a jack to lift the car up and get the Rennstands in place. Everything fit perfectly fine and there were no issues. Again this is a huge reason why I chose them over conventional jack stands, you jack them up right at the jacking points - no need to get fancy with where you put the jack stand, and no need to get creative with where you have to jack. So IMO the Rennstands blow away traditional jack stands and it isnt even a comparison.Note: I had to drive the front wheels up onto some 2 X 4 pieces of wood since the car was just a tiny bit low to clear the Rennstands with the floor jack I was using. Also If you use 2 floor jacks you would be able to go to max height in one go (as you would be able to lift the front all at once, and then the rear all at once), with just one floor jack you have to go one height setting at a time to not make the car tilt too much.4) Portability: These Rennstands were actually a lot larger than I initially anticipated since they have a massive base and width between their feet. However, since you can take them apart, storing it was really easy as I could just slide them beneath my stairs in the garage. This is even better than my ramps or jack stands because when it is taken apart the sum of its components are relatively small and easy to store and can fit in all sorts of places (as you can see from the size of the box that these things come in). Obviously this is also a significantly better solution than buying quick jacks, since I simply dont have the storage space for them, nor do I want to fork over $1600 for a set.5) Wheel clearance: Most people are worried that the Rennstands will not fit their car since the foot print is quite large, however the jack point location on our BMWs are far enough away from the wheels it was not even a remote issue.Summary:Overall I must say these Rennstands are absolutely excellent, they are extremely stable, convenient, offer massive lift height, and very easy to store as they can be dismantled. The Rennstands also solve a lot of the issues that the alternative lifting methods I described earlier have. For instance they allow you to have a jack stand right where you jack up the car so you dont have to struggle for a suitable location to put a jack stand (which as I described earlier a suitable location for jack stands are very limited and sometimes not even available on modern day BMWs), they lift the car by the jacking points so you can remove the wheel unlike with ramps, and they are cheaper, significantly more portable than quick jacks (great for people with limited storage ******* and allow side access under the car which the quick jacks cannot do. So for these reasons I personally think the Rennstands are an ideal choice to support your car, and why I recommend this product. I also recommend the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand over all of the other ones on the market, simply because: they have solid legs (meaning they are stronger than the hollow leg versions), the legs connect from the side meaning you dont have to jack the car up as high to remove them compared to other versions of the Rennstand, and they are cheaper than the other versions of the Rennstand. So IMO you get the best version of the Rennstand for cheaper, so why not pick the ETA MFG version.So if you are interested in purchasing the Rennstands heres are some links to do so:Rennstand:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ece-p252276669BMW Jack Pad adapter:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p255054561\n\nReserved for Future Posts.\n\nWell thought out excellent review!

    "title": "M2 differential and manual transmission fluid flush",
    "content": "Hey Guys,Has anyone done their differential and manual transmission fluid flushes yet? I know a few F8X guys have done this already, but my question was if you guys have used non oem fluids.I know the m2 requires MTF-LT-5 for the manual transmission and SAF-XJ rated fluid for the differential, and bmw has stated that an equivalent like castrol's 75W140 syntrax LSD would be ok for the diff. Has anyone used this before?Thanks--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit - 20/04/22So from the time I created this thread until now I have learned alot about differential oil on this platform and its availability. So here is a brief summary:1) You should use MSP/A if you can get it, this is what bmw stipulates to use via ista, real oem (their etk which real oem displays), and their differential recall tsb.2) I have realized that MSP/A is not available in the USA, so if you're in the US I would recommend to use SAF-XJ (not SAF-XJ + FM), the difference probably isn't huge and you should be absolutely fine with this. This might be the case in Canada as well, as I am hearing MSP/A is no longer available here. So alot of the earlier information I posted was deemed to be not fully accurate on this matter, because I was not aware MSP/A is not at all available in the USA. So if you cannot get MSP/A use SAF-XJ don't feel obligated to get it if you can't find it.3) Check your dealer invoice after the break in service, I have seem some cases where dealers are using SAF-XO fluid for the fluid change. This is fluid meant for open differentials and not limited slip diffs like what we have in our cars. So please ensure you don't have this fluid as it can cause severe damage, as it isn't the proper weight and doesn't have the required friction modifiers that the clutch packs require.4) This is an iffy one, but I would stay clear of aftermarket fluids if possible. I keep seeing stories of how fragile these diffs are and failing prematurely, some due to clutch packs wearing out early, some due to SAF-XJ +FM fluids being used (E9X m3 specified diff oil) - which is scary because some aftermarket differential oils are also suitable for the e9x m3 which makes me worried that it might have too much friction modifiers for our F8X diffs. so I would probably stick with OEM fluids for now.\n\nI changed mine myself at 9,700 miles and used BMW fluid for warranty reasons.

I think they did this because too many people kept using SAF-XJ + FM which damaged the diff and was only mean for the E9X M cars.Anyways on a different note I was wondering if anyone used the approved aftermarket oils. I am looking to use the castrol syntrax limited slip oil since it is alot cheaper than the OEM stuff (in canada anyways) and is approved as an alternate to bmw MSP/A.\n\nSubscribed (plan to do this myself after a few more track days).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDaytona_550Subscribed (plan to do this myself after a few more track days).I'm planning to do mine later this year, maybe September time so guess either one of us will be first lol to experiment I guess.Are you planning to go oem fluid or aftermarket?\n\nMost likely will go w/ OEM fluids (whether branded \"BMW\" or otherwise).\n\nSo what's the correct part number, local dealer is saying SAF-XJ-FM but online retailers are saying SAF-XJ 83222357992.Edit: was able to find my paperwork, 992 was done at 1200 miles service.

So who knows. Going after market maybe another option.\n\nThis is what my dealer just did. Should I be concerned?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bym20e3087Called few local BMWs, all are saying 992 is the replacement for 988. So who knows. Going after market maybe another option.Weird, but that's not what the bmw etk, tis, and tsb (that was released awhile back) says.Since I've seen so many dealers mess up with this simple procedure by still filling up with the saf-xj + FM fluid, I wouldn't trust them. I would trust the recommendations of bmw directly which is to run MSP/A.If you cannot get this I guess it would be a toss up between Castrol syntrax or saf-xj. What I can say is that saf-xj was used previously and I don't remember their being an issue, but Castrol syntrax is indeed recommended as a suitable replacement by bmw so it's your choice on what to use. I personally would have went with syntrax by following the tis.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJustinHEMIThis is what my dealer just did. Should I be concerned?Yeah you should be very worried. Your dealer majorly messed up, looking at saf-xo it is not the correct weight at 75w90 instead of 75w140.Next is that it was made for non limited slip diffs so it does not have the correct friction modifiers to make the clutch discs slip properly without major wear and tear. So your diff is at a huge risk of failing prematurely.This is a prime example of why I don't trust dealer ships.\n\nFuckers, and I put about 1000 miles on it since then, including hard driving. I am going on a rally this weekend. I need to find a place to get the correct stuff and do it myself. I assume it's a standard diff..., drain and fill plugs?\n\nThis site also says 992 is replacement for 988. Is the 992 correct?https://www.bimmerworld.com/Fluids/D...222365988.htmlThanksJustin\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceYeah you should be very worried.

So your diff is at a huge risk of failing prematurely.This is a prime example of why I don't trust dealer ships.Also I wanted to add on that it is absolutely mind blowing dealers are still making mistakes on this on procedure. I would also check the part numbers of your oil and oil filter to ensure there is no mess up. Because I know another common mess up is that the dealership will put a Mann hu816x (filter for common n55's and n54's) instead of a Mann hu8011z (filters for the m2 N55 and s55) filter.Another piece of advice is not to leave the dealer until you check all of the part numbers to the bmw etk. I'm lucky enough that my dealer is really competent (and they know I'm crazy OCD so they graciously take good care of me) so I don't have to worry too much, even though I still really do not like dealerships at all because I'm worried they will mess up.",

    "content": "First-time poster here. I’m the original owner of a 2019 M2 Competition, which I’ve had for about six years now. Around three years ago, I started noticing a clicking/ticking noise coming from the engine bay. The intensity and loudness vary—sometimes it’s barely noticeable, while other times it’s impossible to ignore, as you can hear in the attached video.I might be imagining this, but I swear the car feels noticeably smoother and more responsive when the noise isn’t present—unfortunately, that doesn’t happen very often.One possible trend I’ve noticed: if the car has been sitting in the garage unused for a while, the sound doesn’t appear right away after I start driving. However, if I turn the engine off and then back on mid-trip, the noise tends to return. I’m not 100% certain about this, but it’s the only pattern I’ve observed.The service center in San Francisco repeatedly denied hearing the noise when I brought the car in for service, both when it was in and out of warranty. However, when I finally showed them the attached video—where it’s impossible to ignore—they dismissed it as “normal” and not a cause for concern.I’ve scoured various forums, and the closest matching cases seem to attribute similar sounds to loose bolts. The car is completely stock with 18,000 miles, and I intend to keep it that way for decades to come.I’m at my wit’s end—I just want the car to consistently drive as smoothly as it does when the noise isn’t present. Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated!P.S. Please forgive any lack of technical expertise—this is my first M and first BMW.\n\nThat's the exhaust cam ledge bolt issue.

Either have the dealer \"good will\" it, have an indy do it or do it yourself.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byomasouIf documented under warranty, it should be covered.I have the car in service now, I had moved to a new city but I shared with them documentation of the issue, or at least of me having described it, while the car was still under warranty, from the SF dealership. They just quoted me an outrageous amount, $3100 for \"removing the valve cover gasket for further inspection\". I had given them the Puma number from the thread quoted above and reference to it.....sigh.. do you know if this inspection is related? and who do I contact to see if BMW will cover this? the car has already been with them for a couple of weeks before they even got back to me with this quote\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjordantiiDon't let it go.

I just watched the videos, ordered the parts and tools then did it myself.\n\nHello Everyone,Quick update, after a lot of back and forth, BMW of NA agreed to cover the fix under warranty. I just picked up the car and I can confirm, for now, the sound is gone. They said  they didnt see any scoring, but I asked them for a picture of the cam shaft and you can see attached what they sent me. I am not experienced enough to know what to make of it. But otherwise, the S55 is humming like a bee now.Here is a summary of what was done to it and the parts used:The dealership essentially refreshed the valvetrain on both intake and exhaust sides by swapping out the worn lifters and associated hardware. They accessed the top of the engine by removing the valve cover and the exhaust camshaft. After installing all new lifters, levers, and necessary gaskets/bolts, they sealed it back up. They said this should address any valvetrain noise or performance issues that come from failing lifters and rocker components.Parts used:•\tPROFILE GASK BMSA•\tGASKET-FLANG BMSA•\tGASKET RING BMBIMI•\tDECOUPLING E BMRSA•\tVENT HOSE BM•\tGASKET BMSA•\tTORX BOLT BMSA•\tROLLER DRAG BMSA•\tALIGNMENT EL BMSA•\tCOLLAR SCREW BMSA•\tGASKET RING BMMISAlet me know if anyone needs any more info or has any comments on the picAttachment 3719108",

For example pennzoil platnium euro 5w40 found at walmart in 5L jugs for 1/3 the price of liqui moly has better specs in every single regard from HTHS, NOACK, etc due to its GTL base making it a cleaner oil. So in essence do not fall into the brand name oil game, do your research and save your money.The best place to look for oil advice is BOITOG, that's where you will get advice based on data, most other places you will just get advice based on preference.One more thing, if you are still under warranty just use bmw oil that stuff is EXTREMELY stout.

IIRC castrol 0w40 is better than castrol 5w40, but both imo are inferior to pennzoil platnium euro 5w40 which is a newer formulation, has higher HTHS, lower NOACK (iirc) at ~6%, due to its GTL base stock. Motul xcess 5w40 gen 2 (has to be gen 2) is pretty good/equal to pennzoil as well, but since the specs are really similar/almost the same in key aspects like HTHS to pennzoil so I would just get pennzoil as it is far cheaper. So overall I really like the pennzoil option and it is what I am going to use for my car next year, as it is an extremely well spec'ed oil with great performance and track capable, at a dirt cheap price.Where really expensive oils come into play is If you are really tracking your car hard with over 600 whp with super high oil temps and you want/need even more sheer stability at that point then you would go with 300v, or redline 5w40. But before then there would be no need.But remember the only way to truly know if your car needs a more expensive oil like 300v or redline is to run a used oil analysis, guessing and speculation is pretty much useless as it leads to comments like \"bmw twin power turbo 0w30 is bad because it is like water\".\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceIt's not LL01 anymore after the reformulation so that's why bmw is not listed.

Would you recommend sticking with BMW oil, or the Pennzoil Platinum 5w40?I'm in Missouri also, where temps range from -5°F in winter to 105°F in Summer.Well for colder conditions the 0w30 would suit it better as it will flow easier on cold starts.However, -5°F isn't that cold imo as it is about -20°C and the pour point of Pennzoil platinum euro 5w40 is all the way down to -45°C. So you wouldn't necessarily experience a huge negative with the ppe 5w40 during the winter if you insist on going with a 40 weight. If it was colder like -30°C or worse then I would definitely move to the 0w30. Also I wanted to say living here in Canada where it gets down to -35°C in the winter at times I've never really experienced any negatives running a 5w40 oil in my past subarus, and almost all subaru guys do the same. The important part is to let it warm up before driving it. I generally let it warm to 42°C before I drive my m2 in the summer. Then do not push it hard (no WOT and don't exceed 3000 rpm) until it fully warms up which is 90°C.But seeing that you're in the USA (important because you have more pricing options for oil) and seeing how you do not track your car too much (not that the 0w30 can't take track use, but a higher weight oil would be able to take more abuse) I would recommend you just stay on the factory bmw twin power turbo 0w30 oil. The reason why I recommend this is because of the few reasons below:1) You live in the USA so you can get the bmw oil for pretty cheap as you do not have to buy it from the stealership.2) Despite being a 0w30 oil the bmw tpt 0w30 oil is quite stout with an hths of ~3.5, so it should have no issues with occasional track days.3) since you daily your car in the winter a 0w30 oil will help minimize as much wear as possible during those cold winter start ups. A 5w40 shouldn't be too much worse in the cold if you really must have a 40 weight, but a 0w30 oil will definitely flow better and for a daily every bit helps to minimize wear and increase longevity.4) I wouldn't really worry about your summer temps, for street driving your oil cooler should keep everything in check. If you are hitting limp mode just with street driving something is wrong with your car. For track use as long as your temps stay below limp mode you'll be fine on 0w30, because that bmw oil is stout. If you are exceeding limp mode temps or have a heavily modded m2 I would probably step up to a 40 weight or upgrade the oil cooler, or do both depending on temps and oil analysis. Also alot of guys on bitog intentionally buy bmw 0w30 to use in non bmws because of how good it is. So don't listen to those people that call it water.5) all my advice is just a guide line, every one experiences slightly different conditions based on driving etc. So your best bet is to do a used oil analysis as that will give you the best answers. For example if you see more wear metals running a 40 weight in the winter you must go to a 30 weight. Or if you see alot of wear metals running a 30 weight in the summer you should step up to a 40 weight and get a test.But generally speaking for a stock/lightly modded m2, bmw did a fricken good job pairing it with the 0w30 oil, as it should just about suit every condition.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceWell for colder conditions the 0w30 would suit it better as it will flow easier on cold starts.However, -5°F isn't that cold imo as it is about -20°C and the pour point of Pennzoil platinum euro 5w40 is all the way down to -45°C.

I had always planned to go basic Stage 2 when the warranty runs out, just a Wagner IC and 93 octane flash, but having second thoughts about that.  I'm one of those guys that just wants to get the parts, flash it, and forget it forever.  I don't want any issues.  So maybe I'll get the IC and flash the 91 tune (even though all I use is 93).My car will NEVER see a track.

If so, How?What do you mean? I didn't say that.Also I would like to correct a few things since pennzoil reformulated recently:1) PPE 5w40's pour point went up to -36ºC instead of -45ºC like the old version, so another reason for visualecho to stick with bmw TPT 0w30. But since his winter temps don't get worse than around -20ºC he could technically still run it in the winter, although it would be better from a wear perspective to run 0w30 which would fit well with his all year round driving style + infrequent track useage.2) Comparing PPE 0w40 vs PPE 5w40 CCS viscosity at -30ºC is lower for 0w40 by 600 cP.

Im assuming the rears have the non-rust rotors and they just washed it so it built rust. Either way I could replace the rotors myself if needed.\n\nCarMax also allows 10 days to return so Im going to take it for a PPI during that time\n\nPyesPrice looks goodIf it were mine Id service the transmission, and the diff right awayAt 45,000 both of mine were very dirtyI replaced my oil cooler thermostat with the aftermarket. It never exceed 200°F. Vs 240 oemThese Eng  just dont need that high temperatureMy Miata runs 170° factory Thermostat.  has great performance and great gas mileage.Two Toyotas: one runs 180 thermostat one runs 195\n\nThe late break in was very common during covid, more relevant is whether it got short-cycle oil changes the rest of the time (e.g. at about 5-7k, rather than the 10-11k that the car asks for).  Even that isn't a deal-breaker, just s/t to consider.At 60k it is getting due for some expensive maintenance that you should budget in or get the dealership to pay for if possible (but don't let them actually do it, get it done at a good indie shop).  Likely it is due for trans and differential fluid change, new spark plugs, brake fluid flush (probably at least a grand from a shop, plugs might be a grand on their own).  These brakes turn rusty at every car wash, and look crappy til you get on them a few times, so can't tell by looking at those rears - likely getting to the point they need new rotors/pads, if not already replaced;  that is probably another 2k (go w/ fcpEURO, and you get free lifetime replacement).  Act like you are sure they are totally crapped out and hit the dealer up for a discount - make them look up the job price for 4 wheel rotor/pad swap direct from BMW for some sticker shock.For PPI, have them look for signs of body work, removal of aftermarket speed parts (especially drivetrain stuff - turbos, suspensions, etc.), or cheapo replacement parts that suggest an ignorant/cheap prior owner.  Carfax isn't very reliable (easy to hide issues, sometimes things on it that did not happen), and don't trust a/t that Carmax tells you as they are totally playing the 'plausible deniability' game.Don't let this scare you off, it's just the price of driving the best car ever made.  You'll end up spending way more than this trying to get your jaw re-aligned after having the constant huge grin for the first few months.\n\n@Maynard,Thanks for the feedback! Looks like brake fluid was flushed at 53k and spark plugs at 45k so hopefully they both are good for another while.Yeah the trans and diff fluid I will plan on replacing ASAP. The PPI shop I plan to go to specializes in BMWs so Im hoping they will catch anything funky.Quick question- would the service history on the iDrive show details such as if trans/diff fluid was flushed?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypyes@Maynard,Thanks for the feedback!

There were a couple of minor issues that were resolved, so if the PPI goes well then Im gonna pull the trigger on this car!The tech agreed that the diff and trans fluids were most likely never changed. Ill budget to get those and the coolant flushed soon.Thanks for your input! BMW community has been super helpful.\n\nAlso I just looked up the prices for brake parts.

This I think is helping me diagnose closer to where the problem could be, but looking at real OEM I havent been able to figure out what this bolt is or if its even possible that the transmission could be leaking from it.I dont see any oil above the bolt and I dont see any oil on the right sister bolt. It seems to be coming from this bolt as I havent been able to see any dyed oil above it.Any help identifying what this bolt is or whether or not it could even be the problem would be great. Also, any ideas on what would be necessary to check its tightness as I cant fit a socket in it given the transmission mount is in the way.\n\nHeres a picture without the UV light.\n\nDCT or 6MT?",

But yes it is some really good stuff, so you don't need to worry about it, you can use this stuff throughout your warranty period and even track it without worry.I know there is alot of people saying that it is just like \"water\" and you need thicker oil for better protection but that is not the case. Durability is based on HTHS, wear additives etc, not solely on oil weight. For eg. you can get a really good 30 weight oil with the same or maybe even better HTHS than a crap 40 weight oil.If you street drive your car there will be no case in which you ever need thicker oilregardlessof how hot your climate is. Because you will never be able to hit conditions on the street that will heat your oil up enough to warrant a thicker oil weight, and your oil cooler will take care of oil temperatures. If you think you need a thicker weight oil for street driving your oil cooler is either not working, you are making huge power (no ots map s don't count im talking super large turbo upgrades and if you have an s55 the oil cooler is so large this won't ever be an issue), or you live on Venus.You can even track your car on bmw TPT because of how stout it is, although if heavily modded you should get a thicker oil with a better hths rating.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourcenice!It has already been done on BOITOG iirc, and the conclusion over there is that bmw TPT 0w30 is very very stout robust oil - showing that tinner =/= mean bad oil or inadequate protection.I am curious about how castrol's take on bmws TPT 0w30 will be though.The VOA you referring is done on TPT 5W30.

If you don't mind me asking, what's your background related to oils? What would you describe as a light track day vs. pushing it to the limits? I ask because I have used 300V in the past for race bikes, and wouldn't hesitate to use it or Sport in the car, but if 8100 would be OK, I can get a good deal on that oil.For context, I've done 6 days at COTA in the last 1600 miles (rough math says that's ~860 miles on track) and have a couple days coming up over the next couple of months. These are pretty standard days where sessions are 25-30 minutes each. The frequency of track days will slow down over the summer for me due to the heat. I just don't enjoy being outside in 95°+ temps all day. And as of lately, the car doesn't get driven much between eventsmaybe the odd evening cruise or something similar.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM1500ZThanks for recommendations and sharing the TAN/TBN bitI'm not sure what those stand for so I'll need to learn me something.Here's a good read about TBN/TAN from Blackstone Labs:https://www.blackstone-labs.com/do-i-need-a-tbn/\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byLbsigmanIt's a virgin oil analysis so there shouldn't be any lead, theoretically.There's also no lead in the bearings anymore even if it were a UOA.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydetroitm2Quote:Originally Posted byedycolUnder warranty?Motul X-Cess 5-W40 GEN2Pennzoil Platinum Euro 5W40No more warranty?If just light track day:Castrol Edge 0W40If push to limits at track:Motul 5W40 Sport (you can maybe do 5k interval, do UOA).Motul 5W40 300V (absolutely do UOA after 3k).Redline 5W40 performance (absolutely do UOA after 3k).In all instances you want to do UOA and get TAN measurement!

    "content": "Hello everyone - I noticed my piston dust boots were starting to crack from the heat generated from track usage.First get to the point where the brake pads are removed and the caliper is unbolted. Make sure you have a place to rest the caliper (like on top of the disc) and have a hanger so you are not stressing the brake line. You do not need to complete remove the caliper.]Below: I purchased the Giro Disc boots because they were available and shipped with the titanium brake shims I also planned to purchase. I can't comment on the quality of the boot, but I trust that Giro Disc will be providing at least OEM quality or better.Below is the condition of my dust boots after 7 HPDE weekends at Advanced/Instructor pace. I tapped the brakes a few times to get the pistons to moved outward so the grooves are extended out of the caliper. You don't need to move them out much.Below I liberally sprayed down the piston faces with brake clean and wiped it down to remove the large amount of caked on brake dust and contamination. I used a small screw driver to peel out the cracked boots. It take a little work, but eventually they come free.Below is new seals compared to oldBelow is installing the new seal. First make sure the caliper and piston groove is free of contamination. A simple wipe with a shop towel to getting the nooks and crannies is fine. You have to stretch the inner lip around the piston groove. I did not use any grease or lube. It probably would have helped, but it didn't seem to affect installation. The seals came out dry, so they went back in dry. The inner lip might roll a little bit, so I wiggled the seal fore and aft, and rotated it by hand to make sure the inter lip seated properly. Then I simply pressed it into the caliper by hand.Below I used the heel of a hex wrench to fully seat the seal into the caliper. I moved the pistons in and out with my fingers to make sure everything was fully seated.Good luck!\n\nThanks for sharing this. I have new seals/boots but have been procrastinating. Will bookmark this post when the time comes to do it.",

My recommendation comes from a mix of personal and professional data.The additive package can mean a lot. LL01FE is nothing special in any aspect. It has a depleted additive package compared to previous SOPUS version LL01, and I highly doubt they use star polymers like you can find in 300V, HPL etc. So, it comes down to HTHS and ZDDP package, which for fuel efficiency purposes, is lowered in LL01FE (hence FE), and ZDDP is considerably depleted compared to the previous 5W30 LL01, or let's say, the mentioned oils.0W30 might be OK on some low altitude tracks or where there is no excessive heat, considering the oversized cooling capacity of F series models, M or non-M, but I would still go oils with Porsche A40 approval for a peace of mind.\n\nReally appreciate everyone's feedback, thank you!My car's stock in terms of power mods and I don't see myself adding power anytime soon\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolX-Cess GEN2 is replacement for X-Cess.

I guess for them lifetime ends when warranty expires.\n\nWell, probably look at changing it if you're heading towards 100k miles. It's fully synthetic, it isn't exposed to water, and there are no combustion products to worry about so it will last years without degrading. High/hard use will result in some wear to the innards of the gearbox however, so changing it will help keep any traces of worn metal out of the moving parts.I changed the transmission fluid on my e46 at 150k miles. It was not a good colour (completely black) and the shift action was much, much better afterwards. I've been running it on non filled for life stuff since with changes every couple of years to flush out the remains of the old fluid.\n\nOver the last 200,000 miles in my e92 328i and Acura TSX, I always changed the transmission fluid every 30,000 miles. And after every flush, the shifts always felt smoother. I think there's definitely some fluid degradation that happens. I use Redline MTL now and previously used GM Synchromesh FM in the Acura.I had my e92 in the shop this week and went ahead and had them do a transmission fluid flush even though my fluid was only 2 years and 20,000 miles old. And there was still a noticeable improvement in shift actions. It feels like the synchros aren't working as hard.So from now on, my MT fluid changes are going to happen every 2 years or 30,000 miles.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bym2-6mtI wonder what makes it Lifetime? I guess for them lifetime ends when warranty expires.That's basically it, the lifetime of the vehicle is the amount of time BMW expects the average person to own one of their cars before they replace it with a newer model. From that standpoint, their 'lifetime' fluids will last the lifetime of the vehicle. From a long term ownership standpoint, you should absolutely be changing your 'lifetime' fluids as part of yearly/mileage based routine maintenance. How often you do will depend on how you drive and may simply be based on mileage or something you'll want to do every year regardless of mileage (e.g. if you track the car, you really should be changing transmission fluid at least once each season).Once I finally get my M2, I do intend on replacing the transmission fluid around the same time I get my break in service done and regularly thereafter. It's cheap insurance for a car I intend to own for a very long time. Plus I plan on sending a sample off for analysis so I have a baseline to work with for future reference.\n\nNever thought of this and I intend to keep my car a long time. Should I change it out?

    "title": "Turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug",
    "content": "Introduction:So in this product review I will be taking a look at the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug, and why this is the only magnetic drain plug you should buy for your bmw. Before we begin I must thank ECS tuning/Turner motorsports for giving me a partial discount on the products that I will be using in this review, however I will be as unbiased as possible despite that.Disclaimer:Any technical advice, installation instruction, or product installation is done so at your own risk I will not be responsible for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.Quick intro for those of you that dont like long articles:Cheap magnetic drain plugs made of brass or aluminium commonly break leaving the body of the bolt inside your drain pan resulting in alot of struggles to extract it. Cheap magnetic drain plugs can also have incorrect thread pitches and diameters that will result in damage to your oil pan threads. These cheap magnetic drain plugs can also utilize cheap neodymium magnets that loose their magnetic abilities at temperatures lower than what your engine oil gets to during operating conditions, this means that the magnetic drain plug will let go of all the metal debris it has stuck to until it cools down meaning it is essentially useless. The turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug address all of these issues and provides a magnetic drain plug that has no flaws that a cheaper plug or even a more expensive drain plug may have. Overall if you are looking for a magnetic drain plug this is the best magnetic drain plug available in my opinion.Table of contents:1) Risk of a Cheap aluminium or brass drain plug2) Benefits of titanium drain plugs over aluminium and brass drain plugsa) Defining metal tensile strength and yield strengthb) Metal tensile strength and yield strengthsc) Summary of why cheap drain plugs fail3) Turner motorsports titanium oil drain pluga) Quick overview with picturesb) Specsi) Thread pitchii) Diameteriii) Hex sizeiv) Copper washer fitmentv) Magnetic strength and talk about surface areac) Images of the drain plug fully installedd) Addressing some concernsi) Stripping threadsii) Drain Plug diameteriii) Drain Plug thread pitchiv) Magnets coming loosev) Head rounding offe) Additional stock drain bolt imagesf) SummaryRisk of a cheap aluminium or brass drain plug:So why should you use a titanium magnetic drain plug over a brass or aluminium drain plug? There are a few reasons for this, but one reason is cheaply made plugs often found on aliexpress can have the incorrect thread pitch or bolt diameter leaving your oil pan threads stripped (and if you own an ///M vehicle the oil pans are $1000 USD so it is best not to risk it), more on this later on. Another reason is because the weaker brass and aluminium drain plugs are susceptible to breaking at quite low torque specs and this can leave the end of the plug stuck in the oil drain pan threads resulting in a huge hassle to extract this portion of the bolt.Here are some examples of this:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...84&postcount=7This m2C owner has had an aluminium magnetic drain plug snap in the oil pan long before the torque required to crush the copper washer was achieved.Credit: Diamente Post #16https://www.toyotanation.com/threads...#post-13124826Credit: Diamente Post #16https://www.toyotanation.com/threads...#post-13124826In these images you see a toyota owner with a broken magnetic drain plug from Greddy which is also aluminium.The benefits of titanium drain plugs over aluminium and brass drain plugs:Defining metal tensile strength and yield strength:To explain this we must go into terms such as yield strength, and tensile strength.Yield Strength: How much force it takes to induce plastic deformation and permanently deform the bolt, meaning the bolt is permanently stretched and will not spring back to its preloaded length after releasing (unscrewing) the fastener. This is an important metric because if the yield strength is too low you can end up stretching a drain bolt over and over again while torquing a plug resulting in its fatigue and eventual failure.Tensile Strength: How much force a bolt is able to resist in its axial (lengthwise) direction before failing aka snapping/breaking.Before we go into the strength comparison below we need to note that the turner motorsports titanium drain plug is made out of grade 5 Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy.Metal Tensile and Yield Strengths:Titanium Grade 5 Ti-6Al-4V Alloy: Tensile strength = ≥ 895 MPa, Yield strength = ≥ 828 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=9299Brass: Tensile strength = 360 MPa, Yield strength = 140 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6380Aluminium 6061 Alloy: Tensile Strength = 310 MPa, Yield Strength = 276 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6636So looking at this data we can see titanium (Ti-6Al-4V alloy used by turner motorsports in their drain plug) is nearly ~3X stronger than both the 6061 aluminium alloy and brass alloys in terms of tensile strength. The titanium is also nearly ~4x stronger than aluminium in terms of yield strength and nearly ~8X stronger than brass in terms of yield strength. So straight off the bat we are dealing with a significantly stronger metal meaning it will take much higher torques to break a drain plug made of this material, and you are more likely to strip the threads out of your aluminium drain pan before breaking the plug in terms of maximum torque you can apply. This is great because the common reports of failure was that cheaper plugs broke before the prescribed torque specs were reached, so making these plugs out of titanium will prevent that from ever happening, and prevent fatigue induced failures. This is even more important because magnetic drain plugs are hollow inside for magnet placement, so they are already weaker than solid bolts so a strong metal is really vital to avoid breaks.Quickly looking at the cheaper plugs we can speculate that they fail due to the following reasons:1) The problem normally occurs because of the fact that alot of people working on these cars do not use torque wrenches or poorly calibrated torque wrenches. You commonly hear of owners saying it is tight when it is tight, wrist tight, one ugga dugga etc. When gauging how much torque or how tight they should have their drain bolts. Well this is a problem especially on cheaper magnetic drain plugs because they are made of aluminium or brass which has a really low tensile strength which you can easily exceed if you are not being careful and thus end up breaking the bolt.2) Reuse of old copper washers. I cant believe I even have to bring this up but the copper washers are single use only, once they are crushed down they are finished. If you reuse them at the bmw prescribed torque they will leak and if you try to stop the leak with more torque to crush it down more then you will either strip your pan or break your bolt.3) Even if tensile strength limits of a bolt is not exceeded one can still reach the yield point of the bolt which can cause permanent plastic deformation of the bolt forever weakening it due to fatigue (this is why you should never reuse torque to yield bolts). Over time if this is done alot your bolt will snap.4) The bolt gets a bit seized due to road debris (this one is not very likely because bmw puts a nice cover to protect the drain plug, unless you have an M car because the stiffening plate does not have a cover, but the situation as a whole is also no likely unless you live in a really dirty environment) and the force it take to break the bolt free is higher than the tensile strength of the bolt resulting in breaks.5) Metal impurities weakening the metalOverall I have seen alot of horror stories of aluminium and brass drain bolts snapping inside of the oil sump, and this is what prevented me from buying a magnetic drain plug until finally Turner motorsports solved this issue by releasing a magnetic drain plug made out of titanium. This stronger metal that the turner motorsports drain plug is constructed out of should prevent any breaking issues regardless if you over tighten it (you are more likely to strip out your oil pan threads so please use a properly calibrated torque wrench these sumps are expensive to replace at $1k for M vehicles and alot of labour costs as well if you cannot diy, and the walls of the drain hole are so thin you cannot timersert or helicoil it), the bolt gets seized from road debris, and even if there were small impurities in the metal the overall strength of titanium should be high enough to compensate and prevent failure.Turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug:Quick overview - with pictures:So lets begin our over view of this magnetic drain plug!Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceSpecs:Now lets discuss some of the specs of this titanium magnetic drain plug.i) Thread pitch: The thread pitch of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug is M12 X 1.5 X 20, so the pitch is 1.5 mm. Comparing this to the stock plug that has been used pretty much on all bmws for the last couple of decades, the stock plug is M12 X 1.5 X 16 (https://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/par...&q=11137535106).Here are some images of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug and stock drain plug having their thread pitch measured, and being meshed together to ensure there are no thread pitch anomalies. Note that metric bolts have a 60 degree thread angle so my thread pitch tool will also verify this angle if it fits snugly.Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceAs you can see by these images the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plugs thread pitch is exactly the 1.5 mm as required by the bmw oil pan, and is perfectly meshed with the stock plug and thread pitch gauge. This means that the thread pitch of this drain bolt is perfect and will not cause any issues. The only difference is that the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug is 20 mm long vs 16 mm of the stock plug. The length discrepancy however is not an issue due to the fact that the there is nothing the plug can hit even if it is longer.ii) Diameter: Next we will examine the diameter bolt of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug compared to the stock one with digital calipers, and with a swiping technique to get the maximum diameter (major diameter) of a cylindrical object.Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceAs you can see by these images the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain bolt has a major diameter of 11.90 mm and the stock drain bolt has a major diameter of 11.77 mm.iii) Hex size: The turner motorsports titanium drain plug also features a 17mm hex which is the same size as the factory drain plug. Here is an image of the hex being measured with digital calipers.Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87SourceAs you can see the hex is exactly 17.00 mm so it will fit perfectly in hex sockets (which are actually slightly bigger than 17.00 mm by a small amount) with nearly no play, this means that the hex will not suffer from damage by being slightly too small which means there will be play in the socket. The hex also has a decent depth of 7.51 mm as well so it will be able to better fit hex sockets without slipping out even when flush against the oil pan. The stock drain plug actually has a hex that is 16.56 mm so a bit off of the 17.00 mm so it actually has a bit more play vs the turner bolt in a 17 mm socket as those (like I just said) sockets are slightly bigger than 17 mm to account for bolt tolerances.iv) Copper washer fitment: I was not able to get images of the various washer fitments while performing the oil change but here is what I noted:a) The included copper washer with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain bolt had a larger diameter compared to the genuine Bmw copper washer that was present from my last dealership performed oil change. However the thickness remains the same. With this washer it will be larger than the hex of either the turner or stock bolt and stick out.b) The genuine Bmw copper washer was the exact same in terms of diameter and thickness as the copper washer that was included in the mann hu8011z oil filter (this is the exact same one as the genuine Bmw oil filter minus the ///M logo, all the part numbers on the filter from mann were the same). With this washer it will be smaller than the hex head and stay quite hidden underneath the stock bolt or the turner bolt.c) What I noticed was that despite the Turner provided copper washer having a larger diameter it doesnt really perform any differently than the stock or mann supplied copper washer. This is because there is a small circular raised lip underneath of the titanium plugs hex, this is the only part that contacts the copper washer and it is a bit smaller than the genuine Bmw/Mann copper washer. So having a larger washer wouldnt really benefit it too much as all the force that crushes the washer down is in a diameter smaller than the larger turner washer. The stock drain bolt behaves the same way with the washer being actually smaller than the hex just like on the turner drain bolt, so a larger washer wouldnt really benefit anything in terms of providing more seal as the outer edges wouldnt be crushed down anyways.So overall I opted to use the mann crush washer and there have been zero issues/leaks.v) Magnetic  grade strength and surface area: Not many people think about the magnet type itself when purchasing a magnetic drain plug, but I am here to tell you that not all magnets are the same for the reasons below.The turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug utilizes a neodymium grade n42 type SH magnet (https://www.albmagnets.com/neodymium...ts-grades.html) which retains its magnetic efficacy up to 150℃, however when talking to an engineer from Turner motorsports he informed me in their testing efficacy of the magnet was not lost until 204℃. These numbers are incredibly good especially since bmw starts to cut power at 132℃ and full limp mode occurs before 150℃ - so you will never have to worry about the magnet loosing its ability to cling onto metal particles even at high track temps. This is fantastic because some cheaper magnetic drain plugs utilize cheap magnets which lose their efficacy at 80℃ meaning it will not work even when the engine is below operating temperature (operating temps for oil is at 90℃).  So essentially when your car warms up those cheapo magnets let go of all the metal they have captured and let it free directly into the oil pick up.... Then the only time they will capture anything is when the engine is off and the oil has cooled down and that means they are only able to catch particles that have settled onto the magnet, as opposed to when the engine is on and oil is sloshing around. So here you can see not all magnets are made the same and thus if you cheap out on a drain plug you could essentially get a useless paper weight.The strength of this magnet is also really impressive, it can hold a large wrench and still provide a decent bit of retention even when I pull against it with the help of gravity. So that is really nice, and note even if those cheaper magnetic drain plugs can hold alot of weight if the magnet grade is not designed for high temps then all that strength is for nothing.But speaking in terms of a numbers side of things neodymium grade n42 magnets have a Br rating (it is the magnetic property that is independent of magnet shape and is the magnetic induction remaining after a magnetic field has been removed from a magnetic material it is trying to induce a magnetic field in) of 13,200 Gauss (https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog.asp...20the%20magnet.) while offering the highest operating temperature possible. So essentially it is a really strong magnet even compared to the competition which offers neodymium magnets in the low 4 digit gauss ratings.Finally I must mention surface area. This magnetic drain plug has some of the best magnet surface area out there, because the not only is the tip of the magnet exposed but the magnet also protrudes out giving it more surface area than even some of the best brand name plugs out there. This helps the plug capture more metallic debris than any of the other competitors that may rival this drain plug.Images of the drain plug fully installed:Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceSo here are my install images of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug on my bmw m2. The first image shows a view directly underneath of the drain plug and as you can see it fits perfectly in the hole, and has plenty of clearance all the way around for a 17 mm socket. There is nothing abnormal with the way it fits and does not cause any issues. Overall it fits perfectly and looks quite nice.The second image shows a side view of the drain plug and you can see the mann hu8011z supplied copper crush washer underneath of the drain plug fitting perfectly just like how it would on the stock drain bolt. There has been zero leaks after 2 weeks of my pennzoil platinum euro 5w40 oil change and the drain plug being installed, a lot of hard kms have also been put on it with oil temperatures reaching 98C and there has been no issues whatsoever. So I am very happy thus far with the fit and finish of this drain bolt it has given me no issues at all.Addressing some concerns:While doing research for this review I have stumbled upon a couple of concerns and a bunch of misinformation regarding issues with magnetic drain plugs and I would like to address them.1) Stripping threads: I have heard so much about how after market plugs can strip the oil drain pan plugs, but this generally is not the case. If the aftermarket drain plug has the same thread pitch, and plug diameter as the stock drain plug stripping can only be due to these reasons I have listed below (note aluminium pans already have weaker threads than steel pans):a) The threads in the oil pan are not cleaned out during oil changes and residual oil acts like a torque multiplier and you end up putting more torque on the drain plug than what was required resulting in faituging of the threads. This over time and repetitive cycles will cause the drain pan threads  to fail.b) Reuse of the factory crush washer, again you have to over tighten the drain plug as a result to compensate for any leaks due to the crush washer already being crushed down, resulting in stripped threads.c) Not using a torque wrench and using the bmw prescribed torque specs and thus over tightening the pan (this is the big one).d) Cross threading the drain plug because it was not put in by hand first.e) Use of impact tools or any power tools on the drain bolt.2) Drain plug diameter: Before we can discuss this I must include an image demonstrating diameters.Credit: Site admin from all America thread products, August 28, 2015.https://330zpr17apfr1j45wba4i5dj-wpe...-1-768x327.jpgFrom this image you can see there are a couple of different parameters that a bolt may have:a) major diameter: the outermost diameter and the one that classifies what type of bolt it is eg m12 or m8 etc. (I measured the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain bolts major diameter above).b) minor diameter the innermost diameter the pitch diameter the midpoint between the major and minor diameterc) the thread angle this is another factor that determines if a bolt is metric or inch based, for eg. metric bolts have 60 degrees of thread angle (my thread pitch tool was 60 degrees so it also measured thread angle as a result of measuring thread pitch).d) pitch which determines the spacing between the threads (as we have measured earlier).So I have also heard chatter about how aftermarket drain plug major diameters are smaller than stock or smaller than the required 12.00 mm of an m12 drain bolt causing the drain plug to strip. Again this is complete nonsense, every bolt even the factory one (as measured above) can vary from the perfect 12.00 mm spec (actually no bolt should be exactly 12.00 mm in terms of major diameter otherwise it might get cause too much galling due to it being way too tight, or seize up from being too tight, and thermal expansion differences can play a problematic roll) of an m12 bolt due to manufacturing tolerances. So as long as the bolt is within the tolerance range for an m12 bolt which is generally around 11.732 mm - 11.968 mm (as per this source:https://www.engineersedge.com/hardwa...ead-sizes1.htm). Every source is slightly different in the hundredths or thousandths of a mm range so nothing too major as the general range is the same. Also note if your bolt has a thread that is a bit more round instead of sharp this can impact major diameter measurements as well adding to the mostly benign variation that we see bolt to bolt, so again this shows how major diameter can fluctuate alot so you should not panic if your bolt is not exactly 12.00 mm or slightly smaller than stock. When we look at the measurements I took above my turner motorsports magnetic drain plug is at 11.90 mm so it falls within this acceptable tolerance range as well so no issues with this plug. My stock drain bolt is 11.77 mm, so even smaller than the Turner bolt, but again in the acceptable tolerance range. Right away this debunks the myth that smaller bolts cause issues. It is simply not true and likely the reason for stripped threads was the mechanic did not torque to spec properly, or did not clean the threads of oil which acts like a torque multiplier.What is more important is the pitch diameter which determines how much surface area of the thread makes contact with the oil pan threads, and this is verified via measuring minor diameter and major diameter and determining the average. Unfortunately the blades of my calipers were to thick to obtain the minor diameter of the drain bolt so I could not calculate pitch diameter. However I did perform a wobble test on both the stock and TMS drain plug. What the wobble test is - is that you thread in the bolt down the same number of threads and wobble it to see if it moves. If the bolt doesnt move it is extremely tight in the hole and this could mean the minor or major diameter was too large and is touching the drain pan threads too much preventing any wobble. Since we know that the major diameter is acceptable for both bolts the minor diameter is what we would be testing. The stock bolt did have some wobble and from what I determined so did the TMS bolt to the same degree. This obviously isnt super scientific but it did verify that nothing was out of spec to the point where there was alot of additional friction on the oil drain pan threads to where it would cause galling and potential stripping.I also did mesh the two drain plugs together as seen in the images above and you do not see any gaps meaning thread pitch was good (also verified by my thread pitch gauge).So in general if the major diameter is different than the M12 spec do not panic so long as the major diameter and all of the other diameters are within the acceptable range it is perfectly fine, remember when machining occurs there will always be minor error nothing is perfect when mass produced hence why a tolerance range exists. So dont panic if you see posts of individuals saying a smaller bolt is bad and will strip your threads (most likely their pan threads were either already fatigued, or it was over torqued, or cross threaded, or maybe their bolt happened to be defective who knows), the engineering side of things says otherwise so long as your bolt is in the acceptable tolerance range you will be fine.3) Thread pitch: This has also been a concern for alot of people. But with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug the thread pitch is the correct 1.5 mm as verified with my thread pitch gauge in the section 3 sub section 1. So you will not run into any issues with thread pitch when using the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug.4) Magnets coming loose: Ok this is only a concern with cheap magnetic plugs that rely on adhesives to hold the magnet in, because when the oil gets hot the adhesives fail and the magnet can come loose. Some cheaper plugs may use really weak adhesive and rely on the magnet to also stick to the metal plug, but the combination of poor adhesives that fail in high temperature situations and cheap magnets that loose their magnetic properties (as discussed earlier) at low temperatures will also cause the magnet to come loose. But honestly despite alot of research I did not see this issue too frequently.Now with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug it is fit into the body of the plug using an interference press fit technique. This means that the hole is smaller than the size of the magnet so the retention of the magnet is unparalleled compared to any adhesives and will not weaken over time, and you should never have a magnet fall out unless you crack it or damage the plug body. Now turner motorsports have also informed me that they performed alot of thermal simulations so that the different expansion rates of the different metals (the neodymium magnet and titanium plug) will not be able to cause the magnet to come loose even at temperatures higher than what the engine will see. Another benefit of titanium for interference press fits is that the metal is extremely durable and strong, so you wont have to worry about titanium fatiguing over time due to use and possibly stretching or deforming to the point where the magnet may slip out. So overall the magnet coming loose on this drain plug is a nonexistent issue.5) Hex head rounding off: This is a really rare issue but I have heard complaints of this online. This issue is mainly due to the hex on magnetic drain bolts being alot smaller and shallower  than the socket that youre supposed to use which creates alot of play, or the user using an imperial socket instead of a metric one. This combined with a soft metal like aluminium can eventually result in the hex being rounded off. But this is a non-issue with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug which has an exactly 17.00 mm hex as shown by my caliper measurements in section 3 sub section iii labeled hex size. The depth of the hex is also sufficient enough that when used with a 17 mm socket there is no play and the sect doesnt want to slip off the drain bolt (due to a lack of depth). Combine this with the fact that the plug is made of titanium means there is no chance that you will round the hex on this plug, youre more likely to strip the threads on the drain pan before damaging this hex.Additional stock drain bolt images:Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceOverall summary:Overall in my opinion this is the best magnetic drain plug currently available due to its titanium construction which should prevent any breaking issues from ever occurring. It also features the correct thread pitch and diameter as previously described so no thread stripping of your oil pan should ever occur. The magnet itself is also the correct type to withstand higher oil temperatures that your car may ever experience without loosing magnet efficacy meaning this magnet will always work and be able to stick to any metal particles in your engine. The magnet also has more surface area than its competitors. So all of these features literally make it the best magnetic oil drain plug available imo, there literally is nothing else that I could find that I would say even comes close to this plug. It also is a really nice cheap mod every bmw owner should get because it can also help protect your engine from experiencing any additional wear and tear from metal debris.\n\nReserved for future posts.\n\nWow. Quite the review for a drain plug.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDrKevM5Wow. Quite the review for a drain plug.Haha thanks!\n\nJust wanted to post an update, I just did my oil change today and I noticed that the magnet actually does pick up metallic debris. There was a small greyish layer of metallic sludge covering the head of the magnet that was easily wiped off. It wasn't a large amount of metal by any means - nothing to be concerned about, but it does show that these engines do have ferrous metal components inside that do wear (cam shafts, valvetronic shaft, valve springs, timing chain, etc). So these magnetic drain plugs do work, and aren't useless as many speculated.Another thing to note was my oil temps got to 106*C in comfort mode before I shut off the car to drain the oil. So it was extremely hot and the magnet didn't lose its magnetism showing that turner does indeed use a very good quality grade n42 type SH neodymium magnet.Overall it is a very solid product and I am happy to have it.\n\nThanks for the update.

I recall Bavarian Autosport used to recommend Dimple as \"the highest quality and strongest magnetic drain plugs that we have ever used or tested\".Yes I looked at dimple, but I personally chose Turner because of a few reasons:1) when you have a hollowed out bolt to fit the magnet inside, the chance of snapping is higher due to there being less metal and thus the bolt being weaker. You see this alot with cheap magnetic drain bolts, so I wanted a really strong metal and titanium is insanely strong.2) the TMS bolt uses a very high grade magnet that is also heat resistant just like dimple, I wouldn't be surprised if they were the same magnet type. But the difference is there is more magnet exposed on the TMS bolt meaning more effective surface area. This is another reason why I chose TMS.\n\nSome images of others using a magnetic drain plugA cheaper magnetic drain plug (being hollow makes them weak hence a strong metal is desirable):This shows magnetic wear metals are present in these aluminium engines.N54 drain plug:M4 drain plug, as you can see there are magnetic metallic shavings in these aluminum engines (crank is forged steel, same as the rods, cylinder walls supposedly have iron liners).\n\nSo, this is something you're putting in the engine oil pan in place of the standard steel bolt with copper seal washer - is the purpose to protect the oil pump, or?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftySo, this is something you're putting in the engine oil pan in place of the standard steel bolt with copper seal washer - is the purpose to protect the oil pump, or?You replace the factory drain bolt.

Then check the diff to see if it's weeping or dripping, which is common on these cars, but doesn't mean you need to replace it (just keep an eye on it).Plugs should be fine.Definitely check for the oil filter housing leak, it can be a big deal.\n\nThe good news too is that worst comes to worst, all of those things are either relatively easy DIY or should be relatively inexpensive at an Indy shop.\n\nReally appreciate all the suggestions.Picked up the car today.

I just recently serviced my brakes so is it the same process with the power bleeder connected to the reservoir? You just plug in the bleeder nipple around the clutch and pump it?From what I understand (I havent yet attempted it myself) bleeding the clutch is a bit tricky. The clutch fluid reservoir is built into the brake fluid reservoir and istiny. This means its easy to introduce air into the system. DIY details and discussions here:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1646233\n\nCoincidentally I just had my brake fluid flush done by an Indy a few months ago….I didn’t know about the association with the clutch fluid until the following week…Had a little bit of FOMO that I didn’t ask about it being done at same time as the brake fluid, til I accepted that 1) my clutch felt / worked fine prior (and after)   2) the service seems to be tricky as mentioned above, and 3) I seriously doubt BMW is doing anything with the clutch fluid aspect with their free service.Figured maybe at around year 8 if I still have the car and need the brake fluid done again, I can ask about itBackground:2021, 20k miles, wasn’t done in time for BMW’s free 3 year service\n\nCongrats on the new car, MGM is fantastic color on these.I'd add air filters and cabin filter for R&R, and probably due for an alignment if it hasn't had one (dealership may have checked it or would do that for free).Make sure the brake job is done w/ ISTA (or equiv) that cycles the TCS system, so you really flush it, not just a typical bleed.  If you are DIY, there are aftermarket handheld devices that can do this, but it might be cheaper to pay a dealer if you aren't going to do a lot else with it.\n\nDo the engine air filter and cabin filter too.\n\nI am looking to change the waterpump for My F87 M2 (DCT 2017) and would like a Pierburg.I am at 93K km at the moment.Is it a good idea to only change the waterpump or should I also do thermostat?I am planning to also change the Mickey Mouse flange, because the coolant needs to be drained and refilled anyway.

So if it does fail your car won't over heat, it will just be over cooled. The only downside is you'll have to bleed the coolant again which is messy and no fun.Make sure to also do the water pump ground bolt:https://www.fcpeuro.com/blog/bmw-n55...lt-replacementThis is the pierburg pump part number you should buy: PIE-70288166011518635090 is the OEM BMW part number, which pierburg will label on their pumps. So the two pumps you listed are one and the same, also f87 n55 powered m2's use the same water pump - and so does the F series n55.\n\nOkay thanks!I did not know about the ground bolt, so thanks for that too.",

Also if you're pushing pretty hard on track maybe use some motul sport oil or 300v just for the track, again a UOA will tell you more. But that will depend, I personally think you should be ok with street oil if you're not extremely heavily modified - again a used oil analysis will tell you more.\n\nSo guys which oil you recommend nowadays for a OG M2 | N55 from 2018?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydutchm2So guys which oil you recommend nowadays for a OG M2 | N55 from 2018?I'm using Pennzoil platinum euro 5w40 - which is a reskinned shell helix ultra 5w40 if you're in Europe.Motul xcess gen 2 5w40 is also very good, same with mobil 1 5w40\n\nI'm a big fan of buying good enough oil and changing it more often.I've been buying the Castrol Edge 5W-30 Euro and 5W-40 Euro from Walmart.

    "title": "Motor Mount Replacement Experiences?",
    "content": "Has anyone replaced their engine mounts yet?My left motor mount released the hydraulic fluid recently, so I need to replace it. Since one failed, Im actually planning to do both mounts. I did some Google and YouTube searching to see if I could find a good DIY, but didnt have much luck for M2 or 2 series, and just a few 3 or 4 series results.Anyway, Im trying to decide whether I want to DIY or farm it out, and was curious if anyone has replaced theirs. If you have, what had to be removed to get to them? If just the charge pipe, belly pan, dust shield and/or fender liners, Im good with that, no big deal, but hoping not to go much deeper for access.I already have the mounts, the bolts for the engine to the bracket, bracket to the subframe, and nut for the mount to the bracket, in addition to both mounts and a set of Bimmerworld inserts to stiffen them up a bit and hopefully prolong this set of mounts. My M2 is primarily a track toy at this point, but Im not interested in urethane or solid mounts.Oh, and I also already have a hoist or engine support bar to get the engine up off the mounts.\n\nYou can watch turbo install videos to get an idea of what you generally need to do (on the passenger side). Most of the time people who install stage 2 turbos remove the passenger side motor mount to get access to the turbo. Other than that ISTA would also explain what you need to do.Also keep us posted if the motor mount inserts fit, I am not 100% sure if the bimmer world stuff will fit because the m2 has weird motor mounts: the left side is shared with the f8x m4, the right side is a unique p/n for the n55 m2. So I am not sure if the standard n55 will fit because neither motor mount is the n55 version, and I am not sure if the s55 one will fit because the right side is n55 m2 specific.\n\nHow old/many miles does this car have that the engine mounts have failed?Any mods that might have accelerated ageing?Probably best to also look at replacing the transmission/differential mounts while you're at it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyProbably best to also look at replacing the transmission/differential mounts while you're at it.+1When the motor mounts go, those are the next things in the drive line that gets beat up.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87source%snip%Also keep us posted if the motor mount inserts fit, I am not 100% sure if the bimmer world stuff will fit because the m2 has weird motor mounts: the left side is shared with the f8x m4, the right side is a unique p/n for the n55 m2.

Odd...Seems the M235iR stiffening ring fits!Confirmed that 22118416823 fits.\n\nThanksF87source, good tip on the turbo upgrade video. I’ll probably get a subscription to ista before I start, but I do a lot better with video than static instructions. Good info on the mount differences as well. I’ll give them a trial fit on the new mounts and report back.M Fifty- no mods, car was stock other than an intercooler and charge pipe. I noticed the mount had ruptured when I had the belly pan off to do the downpipe a couple weeks ago. I happened to do rogue trans mounts at the same time, so all good there. The mount does not appear to have separated, the fluid bladder has just ruptured.As far as contributing factors, the car has somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 track days on it. Also it’s a manual transmission and I probably have flubbed more than a few heel-toe downshifts (inadequate throttle blip) as I was getting used to the car. It’s a 2018 with 37000 miles and was on track for the first time 2-3 days after the 1200 mile break in service. This is the first mechanical issue I’ve encountered, so can’t complain.Thanks for the linkZeese, my search efforts didn’t turn up much, or perhaps I passed over this thread when I saw it was about poly mounts.Link to what I’m going to try;https://www.bimmerworld.com/Aluminum...2-E9X-F3X.html\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bybentom2%snip%Thanks for the linkZeese, my search efforts didn’t turn up much, or perhaps I passed over this thread when I saw it was about poly mounts.Link to what I’m going to try;https://www.bimmerworld.com/Aluminum...2-E9X-F3X.htmlThis is the part that did fit:Engine Mount Reinforcement Insert Ring - M235i/M240i RacingThe fitment list is a bit perplexing.

Seems the one you linked to ought to work as well!Thanks! Looks like the same design. I guess I bought the knockoff.\n\nDid you notice the car making any new noise due to this failed motor mount?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypablom2cDid you notice the car making any new noise due to this failed motor mount?I havent noticed a change at all. I have no idea how long the mount has been ruptured. I only knew because of the staining on the skid plate when I pulled it to install a downpipe and trans bushings.In fact, Im still driving with the ruptured one since I havent had a chance to change it out yet. Was targeting this weekend, but probably will be a week later.Good reminder to try mating the Bimmerworld inserts to the new OEM mounts I have on hand. Will follow up soon on that at least.\n\nFinally got around to replacing the motor mounts and adding the Bimmerworld inserts. The inserts fit the OEM M2 motor mounts without issue.We were able to get the driver side mount out, and the new one in without removing the motor mount to engine block bracket by removing the top nut and lower screws then lifting and jacking the engine. I’m glad as the brack to block bolts looked like they would require removing the charge pipe and I didn’t really want to fight with that today.Passenger side did require the bracket be removed, but the bolts are more accessible from below.Took us a half day, majority of which was removing and reinstalling the plastic drip trays, fender back half of the front fender liners, and skid plate. Aside from that stuff, everything went smoothly.The motor mount inserts did add a bit of vibration/resonance in a few spots.1) A slight rattle can be heard from outside the car with your ear near either front wheel2) a slight resonance is causing a minor rattle in the dash at warm idle.3) just off idle there’s some perceivable vibration through the pedals and a bit of a buzzy noise4) during u-turns at 5-10 mph there’s a bit of perceptible vibration through the seat and controls.However, while driving, I didn’t notice much of anything as far as noise, including sudden WOT near peak torque, sudden deceleration from high rpm, and WOT upshift a redline. Didn’t notice any new noises at a brisk pace on a twisty back road, either.It’s probably worth noting that my car has coilovers, some solid bushings, a cage seats, and harnesses, etc, so it was not exactly quiet to begin with. On a mostly stock car, I’d think hard about whether you need these. The noises probably could get old on a commute or mellow drive.I’ll be on a new to me track next week and will report back on what I notice in that setting. I might need to get to a familiar track in late September to have a good A/B though.\n\nUpdate after a day on the track. I’m aware the mounts are adding some vibration through the chassis and steering. Minor stuff but it’s present.Edit to add that a friend (@pal on here) found a similar urethane insert from Powerflex. He’ll probably get them installed soon and I’ll ask that he add his thoughts on them to this thread. I’m sure they’ll be quieter. Will be interesting to see what they do as far as stabilizing the engine. I’ll have to get back to a familiar track to get a better sense of that myself.\n\nThankstomthomasAgree on not putting this off. I replaced them shortly after discovering the fluid dried on the belly pan.Interestingly, I noticed no change in how the car drove. I only noticed the failure because I had the metal splash shield/pan off for another project and saw the black stain on the top side of the pan. So I guess my advice is to check your motor mounts if you track the car regularly.Also, looks like I never circled back with long term experience on the Bimmerworld inserts.I basically notice additional noise vibration in a few circumstances;1) at startup/idle and when moving the car around at parking lot speeds. This can both be felt and heard.2) a bit more vibration through the touch points while driving. This is pretty subtle.3) on track, I can feel and I think hear them in high speed/high rpm corners.The last point has me considering swapping them out for the urethane ones mentioned above.\n\nFor anyone who has installed the Powerflex motor mount insert (black / track), have you checked them lately? I just looked at mine after a few months of driving and about 10 track days and this is what I found:\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2guruFor anyone who has installed the Powerflex motor mount insert (black / track), have you checked them lately?

Zero increased NVH from them either.As a comparison I have Powerflex black engine & g/box inserts fitted to my Renaultsport RS275R track car & they have definitely increased NVH somewhat but have made a big improvement in getting power down.I also have Nolathane red engine & trans inserts fitted to my Golf GTI daily & whilst they have also made a noticable improvement they have increased NVH terribly to the extent Im now looking for an alternative brand.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2guruFor anyone who has installed the Powerflex motor mount insert (black / track), have you checked them lately?

Those Powerflex inserts were going to be my replacement for the aluminum ones.

It seems that there is barely enough clearance - barely meaning not really enough. I am not sure I trust my Harbor Freight engine support bar to hold all that weight. I already bent one of the tabs on the support bar. Right now I am thinking that I'll try to jack up from the bottom along the oil pan to block edge while I use the engine support bar, but I am not sure how that will go.

If you unbolt the engine mount bracket from the block, you can get the mount out without dropping the subframe.",

And I'd appreciate any advise based on my objectives.The question I have is should I replace the diverter valve at this time when I have everything apart???Here's my list of things I'll be doing as soon as all the parts come in:  (I'll be doing these myself, btw I can't imagine what it would cost of I had BMW do this for me)- [ ] Run Techron Injection Cleaner for one full tank of gas- [ ] Drive Car up to full temperature- [ ] Remove items from topAir IntakeCharge pipe top clampMickey Mouse flangeEngine coverCorner strut braces- [ ] Jack up car- [ ] Drain engine, trans, diff- [ ] Drain coolant- [ ] Remove coolant hoses- [ ] Remove all turbo hosesCharge pipeTurbo inlet pipeIntercoolerTIC pipe- [ ] Install Ti Engine drain plug- [ ] Refill mostly with engine oil- [ ] Remove and replaceOil filter with magnetic coverMussleman oil thermostatFill with oil- [ ] Fill Manual trans oil- [ ] Fill Diff oil- [ ] Bleed clutch fluid- [ ] Remove serpentine belt- [ ] Replace water pump ground bolt- [ ] Install Malo Crank seal plate- [ ] Install new Serpentine belt- [ ] Install new TIC hose- [ ] Install new coolant outlet hose/flange- [ ] Install new charge pipe- [ ] Install new intercooler- [ ] Install Turner Intake- [ ] Refill coolant- [ ] Bleed procedure- [ ] Lower car- [ ] Zip tie spare coolant expansion hose to original- [ ] Install new cabin air filter- [ ] Remove spark plugs- [ ] Disconnect injector connections- [ ] Bleed Engine Oil system: 3 starts 10 seconds each- [ ] New Spark plugs install- [ ] Install engine cover- [ ] Install new corner strut braces- [ ] Double check before starting- [ ] Check engine oil level1) If you zip tie the replacement coolant expansion hose to the existing one, make sure you cover the ends so no debris gets in it.2) What magnetic filter cover?3) Diverter valves can improve throttle response, so I'd do it while im down there.4) Don't use silicone grease on any O-ring sealing intake tracts or components going to the engine. Because silicone grease will coat the O2 sensors and damage them. Use engine oil, petroleum jelly, or my favorite super lube. Just make sure the O-rings are compatible with your lube (this is why I like super lube because it is very compatible with all sorts of materials), technically all O-rings seeing the engine will be nitrile, or viton anyways so you shouldn't have any issues.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAmuroRayPictures of the 911 SC?What intake did you plan to get?I'm getting the Turner intake.

I bought the malo industries crankshaft guard yesterday. The car has 78,000 kms and has recently changed the differential oil (with 58,000km), DKG engine and gearbox oil with 75~78kms along with the coolant tube and Micky Mouse hose (for other oem) and vacuum line. I think for safety I would only need a serpentine belt which I think costs about 40~60. I have already bought the crankshaft guard and perhaps it would be good to change the oil filter and thermostat gaskets which both cost 70, I don't know if anything else needs to be changed on the filter, screws etc.. perhaps later the oil filter cover, the coolant bleed screw and perhaps the most expensive ones which are the IC and CP DO88 which are about 1000 could be changed. I wanted to ask you, I'm zero in mechanics, literally a 0 haha, do the coolant bleed screw and the oil filter cover need to be bled or something to change or can you simply remove the OEM ones and put the screw and the filter cover just doing that (which I can do haha) thanks.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJohn wkI like your knowledge about this engine.

Then the oil filter cap is simply opening the plastic one and putting the aluminum one in and the brass coolant bleed screw more of the same, remove and tighten and put back..

    "title": "Tonight...Bit By The Infamous Coolant Return Hose",
    "content": "Update:  in actuality, it turns out that I was actually bit by the failed water pump ground bolt. This has been *known* failure point as the aluminum bolt that holds the ground cable to the water pump fractures, and you lose your ground and as a result, you lose your water pump.What mustve happened is that when the ground boat failed somehow the pressure backed up and blew out the coolant return hose, which was probably weak also.So I would highly recommend changing the ground bolt to your water pump with a stainless steel one which is very easy to do because its accessible and right under the pulley accessible from under the car.Original post:Well, I was prepared, but not well enough.My 40,000 mile 2017 OG M2 blew its Coolant Return Hose 20 minutes ago.  Im now waiting for a tow truck to get me home.  My wife in the car, not too happy about waiting an hour to get towed.I even have a spare hose that I was going to install parallel to the old hose, but failed to do so because I didnt like the looks of it.In case you dont know, this is the little hose that connects from the coolant return reservoir to the top radiator hose.  This is a 5 minute fix if you have the part.My advice, get an extra hose and zip tie to the original so you can get yourself unstuck when it does blow!\n\nRecommended coolant return hose replacement:  every 4 years.\n\nThanks for the PSA! How many miles did you have on that hose before it broke?Ever since reading this thread,I carry a spare one of these in my trunk at all times. I plan to swap it in when I flush the coolant system next year. Ill probably have around 49K mi on the current hose by then.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongWell, I was prepared, but not well enough.My 40,000 mile 2017 OG M2 blew its Coolant Return Hose 20 minutes ago.

I do have some things I would like to ask/say:1) Did your low coolant message come on to warn you about this, and how much coolant was left in the expansion tank when you pulled over?2) There is potentially a permanent solution for this issue, I recently saw it on facebook, but didn't have a chance to try it out for myself and if someone on here wanted to be the guinnea pig I'd be interested to see what the results are.- So you first need to buy this:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHFM22BJ...rOG=1&newOGT=1- Then you need to remove the fittings and buy some coolant compatable heater hose of the appropriate length. Then attach the fittings to that and it should be bullet proof now. Just make sure you don't kink the hose on the tight bends and make sure it doesn't rub on anything sharp.I can't share the post because it's on a private group but I will share their images (credit to Ryan Mans):\n\nMy coolant hose was the original, 7 years old, 40,000 miles.Traveling at night I could see smoke in my rear view camera, I pulled over before any warning indicators came in.Coolant on the expansion tank was empty.My son was able to come to my rescue with the extra hose, distilled water and coolant.  I quickly replaced the hose and coolant.  Concerned that I wouldnt have enough battery power left to do the bleeding procedure, I drove off.It started to over heat, so I stopped and tried to do the coolant bleed procedure, but after about 20 seconds of pressing in the gas, the pump would not come on.So I limped home keeping the water temperature under 250 degrees F, and the oil temp under 220 degrees F.Hopefully I didnt do any damage to the engine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongMy coolant hose was the original, 7 years old, 40,000 miles.Hmm Im at 7 years and 44K miles. Now Im wondering if I shouldnt wait until the coolant flush next year to replace the hose.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongMy coolant hose was the original, 7 years old, 40,000 miles.Traveling at night I could see smoke in my rear view camera, I pulled over before any warning indicators came in.Coolant on the expansion tank was empty.My son was able to come to my rescue with the extra hose, distilled water and coolant.

Having it break on the road is a real PITA as you have to refill with coolant/water and then bleed the system, which for some reason did not work for me doing the procedure, accessory on, heater on full heat with low setting on the fan and pressing on the gas pedal for way over 10 seconds.Limped home at the edge of overheating.  Fortunately, I could monitor the oil temp closely.Then I saw another video where the guy pressed on the gas for 5 minutes to make it work. I'll try that tonight to see if I can get the water pump going to bleed the system.  Either that or the pump did go off and I didn't hear it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDocWongAlso, I just ordered the fix on Amazon.

What if it stays together while Im prodding at it and then it decides to pop on the next drive  I will have done it to myself.

    "content": "DTC 120308 Boost Pressure; Plausibility: too low2017 OG M2 threw this code after installing a Pure500. Symptoms included what felt like boost surge. Rolling into the throttle youd get hesitation and then power would hit. Almost like the wastegate was having a seizure. This showed up in data logs in the rpm and boost trace. Checking the wastegate calibration returned nothing. All healthy. Suspected potentially a warped wastegate flap.Code went away after clearing it and only returned once after that, in nearly the identical spot on the drive home.While I never smoke tested the car to absolutely id the root cause, it was totally resolved after upgrading intercooler and replacing the turbo to intercooler pipe and the charge pipe that came with the Wagner Evo3 I installed so its safe to assume it was a simple boost leak.Leaving this here as a clue for anyone that may have a similar issue in the future as there wasnt a ton of threads on this aside from a guy solving it by replacing a DV. He had other codes in conjunction though fwiw while I had this code on its own.Other attributes of potential interest:Transmission: 6MTPrevious charge pipe: Turner Motorsports (hard avoid)Prior Intercooler: CSFDV: GFB DV+",

Once the car gets warmed up after driving a while the rattles go away. Makes me think the rattles will disappear once warm weather gets here.We have had the coldest winter here in 24 years. ( Relative, I know! )\n\nLately, I get a light clacking sound coming from passenger rear when going over bumps. Not a constant occurrence however.I recently installed spacers but have yet to recheck torque specs so maybe related?

It's the rear deck. Taking it in to be serviced....I have a similar issue - going 40 mph or better if I hit a rough spot, etc. in the road a little tap noise occurs. Sounds like something at the top of the right rear suspension possibly. My dealer looked it over and the suspension is torqued as it should be in the rear. Currently 850 miles on the car, it started happening around mile 750 or so. Was on a nice country drive on perfect roads, didn't hit anything.I ran a test folding the rear seats down and I \"thought\" it went away. Got home and it started snowing a couple hours later, need to test more to confirm if that was it or not.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byBFLYI have the same rattle. It's the rear deck. Taking it in to be serviced....I have a bunch of rattles, only 1 fixed. The concrete street by my house has alot of 'small bumps' that causes the car to rattle all over. This is all low spd (20mph)1) Rear deck rattle - dealer applied felt tape to the rear deck area - rattle gone. Not sure where they applied it.2) Above center console (SOS button) rattle - dealer applied tape, no difference. I applied a bunch of felt tape and pads all around the area, slight difference.Took it back to dealer, they said nothing else can be done...basically concluding its a M car, stiff suspension and low profile tires = noise (boo)I will probably take the car in to a diff dealership on my next service and see what they can do.Franklin\n\nEvery BMW I have owned has creaks and rattles. Nothing is going to cure it.  What really bugs me is the windows making noise against the seals when its chilly out. Warm they are nice and quite.\n\nThe ASD fake exhaust noise also has rattles engineered in as well. Good news, when you code out or bypass the ASD all rattles go away.",

    "content": "OK, I promised several folks here I would post the UOA of Motul 300V, which did not have any track time this time.Racing oils like 300V are not the best choice for street use. But I had plenty of this oil (new formula, current one), and I did not have time to track the car. But that made me interested in how this oil does during daily driving. I know folks in other forums are interested in this, so share it with them.1. Oil did not oxidize at all. This is an exceptional oxidation result even for street oil, let alone racing oil, which is testimony to the quality of base stocks and polymers.2. This oil is packed with wear protection additives! ZDDP is really high, and I would say it is right at the border of being street-acceptable. Moly is also very high.3. Calcium is lowered in the new version to be more LSPI \"friendly.\"4. KV100 is really, really good. It is at 12.79cst, while it starts at 13.5cst. HTHS of this oil is 4.1cP. Such high HTHS, in relation to a relatively thin KV100 for W40, suggests extremely high-quality base stocks.5. N52 is not as hard on oil as N55, S55, etc. But it gives you an indication of how oil performs. This is UOA, not used engine analysis, so don't pay attention to wear metals, although they are stubbornly the same as was always the case. Previous samples, one 0W40, are interesting. 0W40 had A LOT of track time. And not any track time, but sessions as long as 1 1/2hrs without pit stops and at 5,100ft altitude at 102f ambient temperature. 0W30 is strictly daily in winter, a lot of skiing driving, probably 60% open road to ski slopes and back.6. I do drive my car hard, all the time! But, I don't think that is anything extra taxing on an engine, and these results show that.7. The copper level here is just a bit higher. But take into consideration that different oils, especially ones based on ester, leach metals differently.So, before I got this UOA today, I would suggest people check Motul Power 5W40 if the vehicle does not see a lot of track. Now, I believe this 300V is \"streetable\" oil.If you choose to go with it, do it at your own risk, as it does not have any approvals whatsoever, including API.\n\nThoughts on the silicon level?Also, 300v 5w-40 is as thin as most 0w-40. Always worried me for a 450-475whp tuned N55 seeing hard track time in the summer (plus daily driving), so I ran 10w-40 bc it’s still thinner than oils like Redline 5w-40.\n\nSilicone is low, but it is from VANOS bolt recall. Local dealership was replacing bolts so it got contaminated a bit.\n\nTBN is strong. The ZDDP is higher than I would expect since the new version is supposed to be mid-SAPS no?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719TBN is strong. The ZDDP is higher than I would expect since the new version is supposed to be mid-SAPS no?Yes, but just bcs. ZDDP is strong doesnt mean ash production is high. I think also Mid here is at the limit. Phosphorus is at the limit. I think it depends on the batch. Also, this oil doesnt have any approval, so Mid-SAPS is open to interpretation 😂\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolYes, but just bcs. ZDDP is strong doesn’t mean ash production is high. I think also “Mid” here is at the limit.True, but I've never seen a \"C3\" oil with more than like 850 ppm P. This makes me feel better about using it in an older engine also to be honest.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719True, but I've never seen a \"C3\" oil with more than like 850 ppm P. This makes me feel better about using it in an older engine also to be honest.It just dawn to me that this oil doesnt have any approval. So, Motul can interpret Mid-SAPS anyway they want 😂. But, based on how oil held, I would trust them about ash production.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719True, but I've never seen a \"C3\" oil with more than like 850 ppm P.

I know you mention 0w-40. I assume M1 or Castrol?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMSH_I might have missed it but what were previous 2 oils on the report. I know you mention 0w-40. I assume M1 or Castrol?5,000mls one is Castrol Edge 0W40 (lots of track time), and 4,600mls one is Castrol Edge 0W30 (\"German Castrol\") with no track but harsh winter driving.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byericoldi remembered ,experts telling me  for old batch 300v,dont go further than 2000miles using it,it will oxidise.now we see it going a lot more,thats good for street use.so my question is..if someone use it like you did,just for streetable use, is there any benefit vs other streetable,cheaper oils like m10-40 or castrol 0-30 or even motul xcess gen 2 5-40?also ,you have a disclaimer kind f at the end,do you think that will cause any trouble to my direct engine bcs  of more ash products? i know you explained about ash but we dont know yet..last , did you feel any drug from higher hths any time of the day? iknow motul gen 2 you used had a 3.8.So, the previous UOA of Motul 300V (old one) 0W40 after 5K that I have seen in Corvette C7 that was abused (literally) on track showed less oxidation than old Mobil1 0W40 (API SN) in the same vehicle (not mine). That Mobil1 had a bit of ester, so oxidation was higher from the get-go, but 300V had much more ester. So, oxidation in 300V was always under very good control for such type of oil.In this new version, PAO is increased, and ester decreased, which will help oxidation.Is there a benefit of driving it daily, no track? No, there is not. This is cheap UOA. It won't show deposit control, etc. Also, this oil has exceptional HTHS, which is dynamic viscosity measurement and will influence your mpg. You really don't need 4cP HTHS in the daily grind. It affects performance and mpg. On track, if you are pushing it really hard, yes, especially that very high level of ZDDP, which is the last \"line of defense.\"I ran this only bcs. I had a bunch of it sitting and was curious how it will do on the street and track. It turned out I did not have time for track days, and then I was even more curious about it. I refilled the engine within Castrol Edge 0W30 that I have been sitting for the last 3 years. Even for occasional track days, I would run street oil (that other UOA with 5,000mls, 0W40, is Castrol with a lot of track miles and sessions as long as 1 1/2hrs). Detergency and dispersants are going to be in abundance, and those oils are better suited for daily grind. The only thing I would pay attention to is that if street oil is tracked, to have Porsche A40 approval as that approval (otherwise nothing special) has a track test.However, if someone really wants this 300V, to feel warm around the heart, it is IMO OK to use it. If there is serious track time involved, this oil would be my first choice.\n\nHi Edy,I was offered a very good deal on Rowe Racing oil, 5W40 0W40 0W30 whatever viscosity I need they are all available. I can easily get 300V of course but just bit curious whether other racing oils has the same performance in terms of daily using? As you can see TBN is only 7.8 of this oil, my knowledge tells me a good daily using oil will deliver roughly 10 of TBN to maintain balance of the entire oil interval. Am I correct that this oil is absolutely not designed for street use?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySpiritbimmerHi Edy,I was offered a very good deal on Rowe Racing oil, 5W40 0W40 0W30 whatever viscosity I need they are all available.

As you can see TBN is only 7.8 of this oil, my knowledge tells me a good daily using oil will deliver roughly 10 of TBN to maintain balance of the entire oil interval. Am I correct that this oil is absolutely not designed for street use?So, most popular oils in Europe since 2009 have TBN, usually 5-7tbn. So-called low-SAPS oils. As you know, DPF in Euro diesel has been in cars since 2004. To have a long DPF life, Low-SAPS oils must be used. What does that mean? DPF regeneration burns soot but NOT ash. Ash is an oil byproduct and will eventually clog DPF, but lower ash-producing additives increase the lifespan of DPF. They also reduce intake valve deposits. However, less ash-producing additives mean lower TBN. That is not a problem as long as gas has low sulfur levels. So in 2009, the EU moved to up to 10ppm sulfur levels in gas, and gasoline engines started using these low to mid-SAPS oils. So, using lower TBN oils is absolutely fine as long as sulfur is low, as sulfur destroys oil additives. Motul 300V also has a lower TBN now, around 7.5-8. So, ROWE is nothing unusual. Oil companies moved to lower TBN bcs. IVD, LSPI etc. Your average C3 oil that people use in their diesel or gas engines will have TBN, probably around 6-6.5.ROWE is good oil. But it is impossible to know how it will behave unless it has some specification like API. If not, you can only know that if you do UOA but even then, you really don't know about deposits left behind. Like I said personally, I would always run street oil daily or if a little bit of track is involved. Street oils are tough. They must do a bunch of stuff: cold driving, short trips, grocery getting, etc. Racing oils are generally created for one purpose only. Lately companies make racing oils more flexible knowing people want them as they believe it will offer better protection etc. It is really marketing. If you look my UOA, from it 300V looks like good oil on street for some conservative OCI, like I did 5,000mls. But look Castrol 0W40! Street oil, 5,000mls, lot's of track time, and wear is not any higher than Castrol 0W30 without track or 300V.I also have UOA of Pennzoil Platinum Euro 5W40 (Shell Helix in Europe) and Motul X-Cess 5W40 GEN2. I was doing this project with Shell USA, and they did this comparison. Wear metals etc. will be different than Blackstone UOA bcs. it is a different lab. But, both had a lot of track time. Both are street oils. And both had 5,000mls on them. UOA is attached.So, what I think about that ROWE 5WS40? 300V is better. It provides same HTHS but out of lower KV100. That means base stocks are better. Also, the pour point in that ROWE is -36, which is pretty high, which means heavy base stocks and not as much PAO in it. Unless it is some crazy deal, I would skip it for 300V if you want racing oil.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byericoldhi chris,in a how older engine do you mean? and why is that? older engines need more than 850 ,bcs..?It should be fine but some like Porsche never allows back specifying, for example, so you are not allowed to use C40 in an A40 engine. I just typically feel more comfortable continuing to use full SAPS for old engines designed with A3/B4 in mind. BMW allows LL04 even in M52 so I am sure it's fine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolSo, most popular oils in Europe since 2009 have TBN, usually 5-7tbn. So-called low-SAPS oils.

The driveshaft is thicker where it needed to be installed. I ended up crudely milling mine to be wider and deeper, but it still didn't seat perfectly because of the tunnel shape.Overall, how it works is actually a great design, but for our cars the fitment is quite a ways off. I'd probably save your money on this one.Side note: I'd love to see someone fab something similar for our cars because it is an absolute PITA to keep the driveshaft from rotating while removing the diff nut. I also hate jamming a screw driver in the u-joint.",

Guys over on the M4 board say that BMW is aware of it and even though they can't do anything about it to go ahead and report to your SA.  They think if BMW gets enough complaints that they might do something about it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byProdigy.Is it quite a metallic clangy noise you guys are hearing? I have had it on a few occasions, only lasts for a second or so then stops.I'm glad to hear about this and the root cause not being something really serious.I have had it happen a few times on my M2 for very short periods (including yesterday), with it literally sounding like the muffler was dragging on the pavement, or a string of cans being towed behind the car.Before seeing this string I was thinking that perhaps this noise somehow related to a TSB for a loose stiffening plate some early production (like mine) cars apparently had, but I haven't got any sort of notice on this and don't want to bother bringing the car in to the dealer for this unless my car is specifically affected by this TSB, and the car is super tight and squeak/rattle free other than these very sporadic and short-lived disc brake stone issues....\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byTwixThis happened to me on the M Tour, the engineer with us said it's normal and to just push the shield to remove the stones. I didn't notice the sound much, but another guy on the tour noticed it when he was outside the cars while I was reversing.I found this video related to current generation M3/M4 cars (exact same brakes as our M2) that shows as the first item on the list exactly where this is happening and how to move the shields to free any stuff stuck there.Some of the other M3/M4 'problem's' addressed later in this video are interesting and likely relevant for M2's, such as the manual mode kick down feature - need to test that on my DCT M2, or entertaining (such as dealing with the 'poo sound' new M3/M4 cars make).http://www.autoevolution.com/news/te...50.html#agal_0\n\nGet a small pry bar and bend the shields back a bit, the rocks will fall out.\n\nThis issue may also be related to the recent differential recall. Here is a direct quote from my guys:Quote:\"My master technician suspects that the differentials may grow noisy with time, this is something the factory would only have noticed after some driving. Again, this is all just speculation. \"\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygmzanattaThis issue may also be related to the recent differential recall. Here is a direct quote from my guys:Doubt it. The brake dust shield and differential are quite different in location. BMW has nothing to hide on the issue, so if they say differential, it's the diff. If they had say a brake issue, this would be it.\n\nHappened to my M2 when I was driving it home after pick up from the showroom.As a mechanic I knew what it was and simply reversed the car for 30 or so meters and it was gone.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygmzanattaThis issue may also be related to the recent differential recall. Here is a direct quote from my guys:It's a different sound... it's not the diff IMO.  When you hear it on yours, you'll know what I mean.  Its a scraping, clangy sound and when you hear it outside the car, it sounds like it's coming from the wheel.I've had noisy differentials and this isn't the same thing.  A noisy differential will present itself when you turn (mostly in tight turns).  This sound happens randomly (turning, driving straight, hit a bump) and is a metal on metal screech... which is simply something caught in the dust shield grinding away until it dislodges.  The sticky PSS tires throw tons of crap up in the wheel wells and some get caught in the shields.  I had similar noises in my M4 too.If, in fact, it is the rear differential, then something is REALLY wrong and loose in thereP.S.  Given no one has any idea what the issue really is, the master tech is simply guessing at this point anyway.  He hasn't seen or heard the issue nor has BMW given any direction as to what it is.  Therefore, not sure his comment tells us much other than he has more knowledgeable speculation than our less informed speculation\n\nAs others have said, 90% chance it's a stone. Sometimes they get lodged in there really well. Try pushing the heat shield in multiple places, and also tapping on the heat shield with the handle (grip) of a screw driver.Worked for me. Driving forward and reversing a few times can also do it.Edit: Just realized I responded to an old post. I'mmmm dumb.\n\ni recently had this same problem, thought i might share my experience.  randomly started getting the brake scratching tin can noise on my m2 passenger rear, thought it might be heat shields and bent them back and cleared out any debris.  nope.  so i took the wheel/brake assembly apart.  what i finally tracked it down to was the parking brake assembly.  maybe it was due to a rock or something getting lodged, but regardless it was off center. so every time the wheel came around it would scrape just a little against the steel on the parking brake assembly. there is an adjuster on the parking brake you can turn counter clockwise to loosen the brake (read as make smaller in diameter) and then i re-centered the assembly by ear, ie reassemble and spin listening for scraping take apart and adjust again.  after several rounds of re-assembly and several aimless trips around town im noise free.  i imagine you down have to mess too much with the tension on the parking brake and can play more with the centering of the assembly but i never use my parking brake so it did make the whole project much easier.\n\nI had the same issue a while back - it sounded like I was dragging a piece of sheet metal behind the car, not to mention making it sound like the rear end was falling apart.  Having read about the pebble in the heat shield, I assumed that is what was causing the noise.  As the noise occurred randomly forward or backing, I finally pinned the noise down to one rear wheel.  Turned out to be a very small pebble lodged between the caliper and the disk, on the outside of the disk.  It was stuck in there pretty good, and took a screw driver to pop it out.  I was just thankful it didn't score the rotor.\n\nI think I have this. Noticeable at low speed with the window down. Sounded like rasping, steel on steel kinda scraping sound.I'll inspect the brakes tomorrow, really hope it is just this, I was so worried when I heard it.Another reason having an active forum community is so valuable.",

    "title": "Oil change maintaince correct timing?",
    "content": "So I got my car new 02/2019, got the first break in oil change 03/2019 but because the 2018 I got was in 2019 the computer kept showing go get another oil change despite having only 4K miles on it. So I got my second oil change 04/2019. I went recently to dealer to get my schedule maintainece but they said I'm not due till 7k more miles or April/2020? Is this correct? I tho it was 10k miles. I'm currently at 10100. I might go dealer again to ask another service advisor . Is there any additional service or things I need to look at after reaching 10k miles? I want to keep my car well maintained so I don't get issues later down the roads. Thanks\n\nYou dealer is correct. The 4/2019 oil change was one year from the date of manufacture.  Your next oil change started out at 4/2020 or 10,000 miles from the last oil change which ever comes first.  The mileage of 10,000 miles from the last oil change is changed depending on your actually driving conditions.\n\nRegardless of the computer, I've opted to change the oil and filter in my non-tracked M2 roughly every 5,000 miles and only use Shell V-Power fuel. I always change it right before it goes into my non-heated garage for the three winter month (insurance discount for non-use).For winter storage, I use the following:CTEK MUS-4.3 battery tender (no longer available) which appears to be the same one BMW markets under their own name. I also bought the CTEK Comfort Connect Extension Cable so the wiring could be fished down next to the manifold opening rather than closing the hood on the wiring.Wider tire racks due to rear tire size:https://bunkerwall.com/products/tire...vention-8-packWhen I originally took it in for an oil and filter change at 5,000 miles, it turned out to be free since it was within 3 months of the computer scheduled recommendation.If you can afford it, I'd say go for more frequent service intervals. It can't hurt and the records will help if/when you sell the car.\n\nChanging oil before the scheduled interval has zero impact on resale value. Synthetic oil easily lasts 10,000 miles or one year.\n\nExcerpt from Maintenance Schedule by Mike Miller of Bimmer and Roundel magazinesOnce BMW began paying for scheduled maintenance, lo and behold the schedule was revised. Now, magically, the cars hardly need any maintenance at all! The 1,200-mile break-in service was done away with except for M cars. Engine oil suddenly lasts 15,000 miles (dealers are supposed to use BMW synthetic oil).This is an alternative to BMWs factory-recommended maintenance schedule. It is not, Mike Millers maintenance schedule. It is actually BMWs maintenance schedule, more or less, which was used prior to Free Scheduled Maintenance. It also represents my opinion, based upon my experience and that of my readers, tech advisors, and professional BMW technicians both dealer and independent.Traditionally, BMW performed a break-in service at 1,200 miles on new cars, which included changing the engine oil and filter, manual gearbox oil or automatic transmission fluid, and differential oil. With the advent of Free Scheduled Maintenance, BMW stopped performing break-in services except on M cars.I have seen that the engine and driveline oils in new modern BMWs are literally full of metal at 1,200 miles  as has always been the case with any new car. For this reason, I recommend a 1,200-mile break-in service.Oil and Filter Intervals BMW recommends their Castrol 5W-30 synthetic motor oil in all BMWs except contemporary M cars, for which they recommend their Castrol 10W-60 synthetic motor oil. The factory oil change interval is controlled electronically, but is presently about every 15,000 miles. If you are running BMWs oil, I recommend an oil and filter change interval between 5,000 and 7,500 miles.\n\nThey don't use Castrol anymore. BMW uses Shell/Pennzoil now. I change my oil halfway through the cycle at 5,000 miles. I've heard all the pros and cons. Do what makes you sleep better at night. That goes for more than oil changes.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byRAM_F30_F87Oil and Filter Intervals BMW recommends their Castrol 5W-30 synthetic motor oil in all BMWs except contemporary M cars, for which they recommend their Castrol 10W-60 synthetic motor oil. The factory oil change interval is controlled electronically, but is presently about every 15,000 miles.10W60 does NOT go in these M cars, nor any S55 engine M car.  Oil change interval is 1 year or 10K miles.  This should be deleted as it is wrong.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCTSean10W60 does NOT go in these M cars, nor any S55 engine M car.  Oil change interval is 1 year or 10K miles.  This should be deleted as it is wrong.You are right 0W30 or 5W30 is the correct oil.\n\nI have a \"friend\" that's able to alter the Condition Based counter to get an oil change whenever he feels it's needed..Its his way of leveling the playing field and rebel against BMW's unreasonable maintenance schedule, for which he paid extra for.Of course,Ipersonally find this unethical but since my \"friend\" is the one who does this, I'm still going to get into Heaven..\n\nSo really my question is should I go and request and pay for another none schedule oil change? I do feel 10k is a lot of miles esp on a M car. I have literally only used shell vpower since I got this car in feb, I really want to maintain it for longevity. How much are these oil changes? And should I only do it at a dealer?\n\nI've run two used oil analyses on my BMW 0W-30 used in my 2016 M235 which runs a slightly detuned version of the N55 found in the M2 N55.  I drive somewhat hard and no track time.  I've gotten the free 1 year/10k oil changes but I've always done a change myself between the free change.  Per my UOA tests, the BMW 0W-30 is getting close to falling out of its viscosity spec at ~5000 miles.  Everything else was well within spec.  I wouldn't push the oil past a 6000-7000 mile change.  That's my plan after my last free change.\n\nMy second oil service is coming up next month. It will be less than 10k miles since it was done, but will have been a year. This is only my second brand new BMW, so the free maintenance is nice to have.What I don't like about these new BMW engines is there is no oil dipstick to actually look at the oil level. I'm a mechanic and kind of old school, so that takes some getting used to. I still haven't tracked my M2 yet so I know I haven't pushed the car that much.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byXutvJetI've run two used oil analyses on my BMW 0W-30 used in my 2016 M235 which runs a slightly detuned version of the N55 found in the M2 N55.

That's my plan after my last free change.This is great info, I just put 0W-30 in mine for the first time. Wanted the cold temperature protection for winter but was worried about the longevity. Did you ever test 5W-30?\n\nHere are some links about BMW oil recommendations. The first link informs that BMW uses Shell oil (Pennzoil).The second link is their oil recommendation for the M2 N55. The same oil is recommended for the M4 S55.https://www.shell.com/business-custo...-supplier.htmlhttps://www.shell.com/motorist/find-...NfRUZ0OFBuRFFWAvailable on Amazon Prime for $57. for a case of 6.\n\nAs has been stated in another thread, the Platinum Euro 0W-40 is LL-04 rated and not LL-01.\n\nPersonally I think the oil changing schedule from BMW (or lack their of) is pretty OTT. Everyone seems to disagree with me on this topic.As an engine's mileage increases it's friction from the piston rings to the cylinder walls decreases. An engine on 80k miles will have much, much less friction/ wear material from the metal & less stress on the oil; greater duration between oil changes at 80k. Add to the unmeasured conditions, poodling around at 30mph, against full throttle starts... ragging the hell out of it your duration has increased/ decreased.I changed oil at 10k up to 60k, after that I went to around 30k oil changes.BMW M2 Owner - 121,000 miles; self-maintained.\n\nNice to know how much safety margin they put in, but I'd like my rings to still be holding tight at 60k.  It never ceases to amaze me when people buy an M and then cheap out on parts and maintenance.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMaynardIt never ceases to amaze me when people buy an M and then cheap out on parts and maintenance.Yeah, especially when  at least in North America  you can get a full refund (less return shipping) on used oil and filter from places like FCP Euro.",

    "title": "Would appreciate some help on servicing",
    "content": "Bit embarrassed to ask this, but I'm a BMW noob. Just got both my first BMW and M car, a 2018 M2 LCI.Sales guy told me general service intervals for this car are 15k miles or 18 months, whichever comes first? Was surprised by this but a friend who previously had an M2 backed this up.I never received a physical service booklet with the car as sales guy told me its all coded in the centre console and via your key. Fair enough. However I'm struggling to make sense of some of the service info, would appreciate if someone can help me:1. It advises me the next 'vehicle inspection' is due in December. Is this a minor service? This must be separate from the MOT as its due in November.2. You can see the car wasn't serviced at all last year in 2022, but it was done twice in 2021. It's currently done 23k miles, so its done 4k miles/16 months since the last service. I was thrown off a bit when the sales guy told me it didn't need another service till December 2024 (see my next point) but then this service history record throws me off with nothing done last year and a decent gap since the last one. Should I be looking to get it serviced in the next 1k miles/couple of months - regardless of it saying it isn't due an inspection until end of this year as per point 1, and what it states in my next point......3. The servicing tab then advises the next inspection is due in November 2024 or at 15k miles. The oil and brake fluid checks indicate the same. This seems an awfully long time away? I'm wondering the fact the previous owner got it serviced twice in 2021 as I show further up has thrown the dates off in the system?Overall I'm confused what it requires at the end of this year and next year, the fact it had no service done last year and that there will have been a 2 year gap between the last recorded one in Oct 21' and November 23' if I stick to the schedules as it advises me.Would really appreciate if someone can help me make sense of this.\n\nWelcome. The BMW service centers idea of what is ideal and what is actually ideal differs significantly. The onboarding servicing system is for soccer moms and people that are lazy and or dumb. Forget about it entirely and just do the following (you can reset those minders as you follow this schedule)You cant over service these cars. Overkill service and itll last forever like a Camry. The N55B030T0 is particularly robust.Find a quality independent BMW shop and avoid the dealer service center like the plague. Learn to get comfortable changing your own oil. Its not hard, and requires only basic tools and youll pocket $200+ a lick. Google will lead you to diy oil change videos and how to reset the maintenance lights.- Run OEM oil or Pennzoil Platinum Euro 5W40 and change it every 3-5000mi with OEM Mann oil filters. All in DIY this is like $50.- Change your diff and trans fluids every 30-40k if not tracking the vehicle. Use OE fluid. Im running the appropriate Redline fluid with great results. Everyone has their opinion on which fluid is best for Trans/diff but you cant go wrong with these. As long as youre changing both regularly youre fine.- Brake fluid once every 12-18mo if not tracking. You can also DIY this with a pressure bleeder. Upgrade to Castrol SRF. Its not that expensive and brakes are kinda important.- Coolant every ~3yr so youre about due.Finally, Read this old school maintenance write up and youll see its generally in line with the above but covers more (air filters, etc):https://www.e90post.com/forums/attac...2&d=1338394953Keep an eye out for leaking oil filter housing gasket, leaking rear differential/axles, and leaking oil pan gasket.

Its essentially turned off.That's what I was going to ask as a follow up question, whether or not it was market specific. Thanks for the answer.Does anyone know if this feature can be turned on, perhaps through Bimmercode?\n\nSpecifically if youre not modded or tracking the car, just follow the maintenance manual. You also dont need to change the diff, trans, or spark plugs on any sort of time interval, just mileage. Id suggest the oil every 5,000 miles or 1 year though even though its probably good for the full 10k. Maybe consider coolant and DCT oil at 10 years or 100k miles. The DCT oil is heavily filtered and doesnt get very hot in normal operation.If youre tracking the car or modifying it (specifically tuning or slicks), then youre going to generate more heat and wear and need to adjust the maintenance accordingly.\n\nIn the US oil changes are once every 10,000 miles or once a year which ever come first. Brake fluid flushes are every three years.When we start our M2s the dash displays when the next service is due.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///393- Coolant every ~3yr so you’re about due.I saw somewhere that coolant on the newer BMWs don't need to be flushed out?

Thats laughable. Theres no such thing as a fluid that lasts a vehicles lifetime (when considering the entire 100K+ mile lifetime of a vehicle).I plan to change out the coolant in my 18 M2 every four years.

    "content": "Hey guys, as the title states, I am trying to take advantage of the FCP Euro lifetime warranty by returning my old oil and filter. However, I tried fitting 7 BMW TPT 0W-30 bottles and a Mann Filter in a USPS large flat rate box and it wasn't able to fit. I also didn't know that you needed to double seal the oil bottles with two plastic bags so that will take up even more space. Furthermore, the lady at the USPS store told me that used motor oil is \"HAZMAT\" so I am not able to ship it. I have sources online (including Blackstone) that say otherwise but I am not sure how to continue.TL : DR - What is the cheapest (and legal) way of shipping used motor oil back to FCP Euro?Thanks!\n\nIt wasn't cheap, but I used UPS, think it was like $40-50 to ship it back. Dropped all the bottles into a trash bag and used the same shipping box that FCP used.\n\nI just put all the stuff back in the same box that FCP ships the product in. A couple months ago it cost me $17 to ship an oil change from OH to CT using the UPS online shipping tool.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAltraIt wasn't cheap, but I used UPS, think it was like $40-50 to ship it back.

Im just a couple months out from my first attempt at this as well.

When they ask the couple questions they usually ask - is it hazardous, prohibited, whatever -just say no, which is the truth based on their own rules. I've never had someone actually ask \"what's in the box\"\n\nI sent brake fluid a few  months ago, much smaller box of course and I am lucky that I live pretty close but its a great deal, SRF is expensive and I think cost me less than $10 to ship it to to them.Oil is definitely more annoying but I can't see how you not saving money, like someone said pirateship is amazing, they will choose the cheapest which for a bigger package is probably UPS, no way shipping will cost the same price as bunch of oil and oil filter.\n\nDefinitely tend to use FedEx or UPS. Another tip is to bundle/batch your returns, to optimize the weight/volume for shipping. Helps to have multiple cars worth of product.I have found its still worth the return in most cases, but definitely can be closer to a wash in SOME scenarios.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCTSeanIt's not hazmat.go herehttps://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c3_022.htm#ep898952print this343.24 Mailable Flammable and Combustible LiquidsThe following are mailable:f.

This'll be the first oil I return to FCP Euro. For shipping the oil back to FCP Euro via USPS, I think I'm in a good spot with the above documentation.\n\nI dropped off oil to return to FCP Euro at the local USPS branch today. It was a smooth experience. I purchased the ground shipping label online, answerednoto the question about hazardous or flammable materials (which, by USPSs own definitions, used motor oil is neither), marked the checkbox in the USPS ClicknShip web app that indicated my shipment contained plastic containers with a total of more than 1 gallon of liquid, paid the shipping fee, and affixed the shipping label to the box. It cost $30 all in, including shipping insurance.I also shipped my UOA sample off to Blackstone Labs during the same trip to the local Post Office. The Post Office employee accepted both readily.Overall, an easy shipping experience! Certainly, it was much easier and than I was fearing it would be. Now Ill watch my FCP Euro account for the credit for the oil and filter purchase price.\n\nMy first ever used oil return to FCP Euro is complete! It was a pretty smooth process.I purchased the USPS ground shipping label online. That was a very convenient option.The USPS ground shippping cost $30 to send the 16 lb box with 7 liters of oil and the used filter from US West Coast to US East Coast. It was estimated to take a week to arrive, but ended up taking about 3 days.FCP Euro has credited me for the used oil change kit Id purchased back in the summer of 2022:\n\nEarlier this month I sent my 2nd batch of used oil and filter back to FCP Euro and they quickly credited me for the original purchase price. Shipping cost was still around $30 to send the used filter and 7 liters of used oil back to 'em. Shipping is easy: double-bag everything, print out a shipping label from the USPS website, slapup arrowand shipping labels on the box, and schedule a package pick up with USPS for the next day.

    "content": "I realize that the 5000TL is sort of the \"go-to\" for an M2C, but has anyone tried the 5000TLX?  I've got an Element and an RDX that I'd like to use the jack on as well.  QuickJack wanted to sell me the TL AND their frame extenders-- but that a) takes up a fair bit of room and b) isn't exactly cheap.So-- does the TLX work with a M2C?  I keep confusing myself with the measurements.TIA.R.\n\nIt's easy to check, grab a measuring tape and measure the distance between the jacking points. With the TLX I assume the primary concern would be that the inner distance between the two points will fit in the TLX's spec.You need to make sure the distance between the jack points is greater than the minimum distance specified in the TLX specs, I don't think there is much risk that the distance between the wheels is too small that the TLX frames would not fit in between.I have the SLX and frame extensions but haven't really checked if the M2 would fit on the extensions (although likely the stacked height with the extensions would make it a pain anyway). The one small benefit of the extensions for the Element and RDX would be the extra height in this case. Do keep in mind that with the higher ground clearance vehicles the QuickJack will be providing less lift.I would recommend getting the pinch weld blocks though, I feel much safer with them for Subarus, Hondas and Toyotas. I use a set of 4 rubber adapters for the BMWs with the including QuickJack rubber blocks and they're stable, I had tried eBay rubber adapters for pinch welds and had a Subaru come unbalanced. The included QuickJack rubber blocks are softer than the pinch weld blocks and I feel that probably makes them less stable.\n\nI measure the distance between the front and rear tires on my M2 at 81 inches. The 5000TLX overall frame length is 76 inches.So, you should have around 5 inches of buffer  depending on your specific tires and wheels  with the TLX frames and your M2.Alternatively, if you park indoors in a private space: consider storing the frame extensions under a vehicle. We store our frame extensions in their shipping carton under the Subaru Forester in our garage. They fit very well there.\n\nHi OP - did you end up getting the TLX model?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byatlasHi OP - did you end up getting the TLX model?I have a 7000TLX and works under my M2C\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byatlasHi OP - did you end up getting the TLX model?My heart decided to try to kill me last summer as I found out that my Widowmaker was ~90% blocked (with no symptoms)-- Surprise!  I was Grounded and five stents later, am now well enough to plead with the FAA for the past 18 months to get my flight status back-- bureaucracy is *nobody's* friend.So, that's impacted my discretionary spending a *tiny* bit.On the plus side-- my deferred FAA Class I medical *just* shifted from \"Transmitted\" (where it's been parked for the past 18 months) to \"Final Review\" today.The doc at the medical service that my Union pays to shepherd medical issues through the FAA buffoonery says that my package is solid and he can't see any reason for refusal-- so I'm **VERY, VERY** cautiously optimistic that I may get a Certified Mail letter with my Class I in it in a few weeks.Then?  (A TON of) studying, ground school, simulator training, a sim check, a couple days of flying the jet under supervision, another check ride..... and then I'll be reaqual'd back to flight status.After that?

    "content": "Last weekend I fitted my Fabspeed Sport Cat, which required removal of the front chassis stiffening plate. I know a few people have done this before, and in the DIY threads, no-one has ever posted about replacing the bolts that hold this on, even though ISTA+ gives torque settings of 56Nm + 90 degree rotation, and states that the bolts must be replaced.This evening I had to remove the stiffening plate again to fit an upgraded Charge Pipe, and as I was putting the plate back on, I started to get concerned that these bolts might sheer if I don't replace them. I know the torque + angle tightening sequence is designed to stretch the bolts, and that doing this is only possible a few times.I have an upgraded FMIC on its way, and will likely need to remove the stiffening plate again... I'm thinking of getting some new bolts this time, but wanted to hear feedback from others on the forum... is this really necessary?Thanks in advance!\n\nJust got a quote for these bolts from my local dealer... $8.65 each!They offered to give me a discount to bring it down to ~$5.20 each... still very very expensive for an M10 x 33 bolt.\n\nI didn't replace my bolts but I did manage to damage the threads on one of the bolts.

So I installed my CP, change.  FMIC, change.  Down pipe, changed?!!  Isnt that a bit extreme?Yes these bolts are torque to yield meaning they are stretched. If you reuse a stretched bolt and restretch them as per bmw's torque spec you risk the bolt snapping. If you do not yield the bolt then you will not apply the correct amount of load and an even load onto the head of the bolt and threads, so chassis stiffness is not as it should be.Also water pump bolts are single use torque to yield as well. So are strut tower bolts, differential drain bolts etc.\n\nI was just watching brake servicing on M2 Competition.  It says 30 Nm + 90 deg.... but if re-use 110 Nm.

Real oem says they are also the exact same bolt so despite bmw not specifying that the front bolt must be yielded as they only give a torque spec, since they are the same as the rear caliper bolts which do need to be yielded and thus stretched we know these bolts will stretch when subjected to torques past 30 nm.This means they MUST be replaced and you really shouldn't reuse a previously stretched bolt. Because a previously stretch bolt is now weaker and is susceptible to snapping. It will also not be able to apply the same clamping load after the material is stretched (a bolt is stretched to enable it to provide a more equal clamping load along its whole thread length and prevent it from vibrating loose, once stretched its elastic properties change and clamping loads won't be the same anymore) so that bolt really shouldn't be reused.So imoFaRKle!shouldn't have put a used bolt torque spec, he should have said new bolts are required...\n\nInterestingly, BMW also recommend replacing some bolts that aren't obviously being torqued to the point of being stretched - but are being screwed into aluminium.Made me wonder about the plating on them being some kind of passivating layer designed to prevent electrolytic corrosion, and hence the need to replace them with new each time they are removed.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyInterestingly, BMW also recommend replacing some bolts that aren't obviously being torqued to the point of being stretched - but are being screwed into aluminium.Made me wonder about the plating on them being some kind of passivating layer designed to prevent electrolytic corrosion, and hence the need to replace them with new each time they are removed.Interesting point.\n\n1) whats ISTA?I tried google first but couldnt get.

    "title": "Spark Plug Question",
    "content": "I have a 2018 factory stock OG M2, no mods.  I currently have approximately 12,000 miles on the spark plugs.  They were last replaced four years ago at 15,000 miles using the BMW free maintenance program.  My SA keeps wanting me to replace them because BMW recommends new plugs at every third oil change.  The car only has 27,500 miles on it, no track use.  When should these plugs be replaced?\n\nThe 'normal service' maintenance chart calls for plugs every 30k. If you are easy on the car, it could qualify for 'normal service'. However, most drivers of performance cars operate them under what is considered 'severe service' conditions.It is not unusual for specialists to tighten up maintenance intervals based on their experience and observations during repairs. Considering BMW oil change intervals are way too long it is likely the '3 oil changes' is approximately 22.5-30k depending on the specific shop.\n\nIf you're not tracking the car, go the complete 30K on the plugs and not worry about the time interval. The intervals on an M-car presumably would have some track time built into the maintenance intervals. The M235iR has 5,000 km spark plug change intervals, but no time interval exists. That is nearly 100% competitive racing mileage.\n\nThanks for the replies.  I thought it was 30,000 mi, but wasn't sure.  The car is \"exercised\" from time to time, but 12,000 miles plug change interval is a bit overkill.",

I was wondering if you guys would recommend anything different (located in Tuscaloosa, AL so no snow or crazy weather).Lastly, what is an average price for a quality ceramic coating? Ppf?Thanks in advance\n\nCongrats and welcome.Oil, definitely not the factory interval. Grab a LL-01 approved oil such as Pennzoil Platinum Euro 5w40 or Motul Xcess Gen2 and change it regularly. Lots of opinions on this. I change at 3000 or less as mine sees track time.The stock tires are great. You can move to PS4S when they wear out if youd like something with a bit more grip in exchange for response.Full detail, paint correction and ceramic coating figure ~$1600. PPF 3-5k depending on how much you do and who you use around these parts.Get an electric pressure washer and foam cannon along with some decent detailing products. Larry at Ammo NYC and Pan The Organizer have great detailing content on YouTube. Both have videos on their wash methods and detailing tips along with product recs you cant go wrong with.\n\nWelcome.Regarding oil, use a BMW Genuine M-filter and an oil with LL-01 or LL-01FE approval. Be sure to pick one that is API SP which has the latest formulation requirements. I have had great success simply using the BMW Genuine oil. Mobil 1 0w-40 is a popular oil at a great price at big box stores.Tires can be changed out for Michelin PS4S or Conti ExtremeContact Sport 02 for street use.",

    "content": "Howdy all, when flushing and replacing the brake fluid do I have to do anything special with the clutch as well?\n\nI would recommend flushing the clutch fluid as well - but it's best to do this with a pressure bleeder because the baffle for the clutch side is so small itll run out of fluid in 2-3 pumps if you bleed the clutch by pumping the pedal. But other than that no special procedure just ensure the reservoir is topped up properly and make sure you check the clutch side carefullybto ensure its full as well.\n\nWhats a good interval for clutch fluid?\n\nI'd just do it with brake fluid because you're pretty much there anyways.

I have a Motive I use for brake flushes, so Ill make sure to add in a clutch flush when I do the brakes every two years.I also use a Motive and like the guy above just fill the reservoir to both save cleaning the Motive and wasting racing fluid (I also use a syringe to first remove old fluid).Tips for doing the clutch, don't let the reservoir fluid level drop much below the neck as the clutch chamber is very small and empties very very quickly (and so sucks air!).  I fill to top of neck, bleed to bottom of neck or so, refill & repeat 3-4 times (obviously closing the bleed valve while line is pressurised).The clutch bleed valve needs a lot of loosening (compared to a brake caliper) before fluid will flow, first time you'll think it's not working.\n\nCar in for service tomorrow, getting brake fluid done as been a couple of years.

I should have done it with each brake fluid flush but I ran out of fluid last time.\n\nCheers. And for a competent garage not much to fuck up doing the clutch fluid?Is it as hygroscopic as brake fluid?\n\nIt's the same fluid using the same reservoir.  When pressure bleeding, you just add the clutch slave cylinder to the list of points you need to bleed from.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by3t3pCheers. And for a competent garage not much to fuck up doing the clutch fluid?Is it as hygroscopic as brake fluid?Clutch fluid is brake fluid, they share the same reservoir.Your shop will most likely pressure bleed it with positive displacement (pumping fluid), no way will they have the time to constantly refill the reservoir, they likely have a very expensive brake bleeder machine. So you don't need to worry about running dry.\n\nAh interesting thanks. So the line to the clutch would not be bled but it would get very slowly by diffusion new fluid when brakes are done?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by3t3pAh interesting thanks. So the line to the clutch would not be bled but it would get very slowly by diffusion new fluid when brakes are done?no it's a completely separate compartment inside of the master cylinder (bmw does this so if the clutch loop failed you wouldn't loose brakes as well), so technically there would be no fluid exchange, moisture would be able to get through though because there's a gap at the top - this is why you need to flush the clutch fluid eventually (while clutch fluid doesn't get hot and boiling isn't a concern, contamination and high water content causing issues is a concern).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymaxcbrdriverConsidering the huge pita it is if you introduce air by running the bleeder dry, I would consider the waste of a bit of brake fluid and cleaning just a necessary cost of using a bleeder. I always buy extra knowing id rather be safe than sorry.But that was the point of my post, to save others experiencing the pita that I did first time.  I've done 3 clutch bleeds since (my & mates cars) re-filling the reservoir (rather than filling the Motive) without an issue.  Yes it adds 10min max to the job but good racing fluid isn't cheap and I'd guess cleaning the Motive would probably take 10min anyway.\n\nSince we have anti-lock brakes is there concern with not running the pump (or whatever the ABS actuator is called) during a flush?Just curious what that process may look like.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byGabhartSince we have anti-lock brakes is there concern with not running the pump (or whatever the ABS actuator is called) during a flush?Just curious what that process may look like.I didn't and the brakes are fine.

I will also go over why every BMW owner should own at least 1 jack pad adapter, but why it is better to get the four pack (which is what I opted for).So if you are interested in purchasing the BMS jack pad adapter here is the link to do so:https://burgertuning.com/collections...ck-pad-adapterDisclaimer:Damage/Injury Disclaimer: Any information, guidance, technical advice, coding advice, tuning advice, datalogging advice, installation instruction, calculation, experiment, safety information, or product installation demonstrated in my reviews is to be consumed and or done at your own risk.

I then reach out to the company offering the product and ask them if they would be willing to sponsor me in a review, if the answer is yes then I write a review, if the answer is no I would end up buying the product (sometimes at a later date) but I wouldnt complete a detailed review about it (I might write something, but not to the same extent as my standard reviews). But the critical thing is that I reach out for a sponsorship and not the other way around, this means that the products I am reviewing are actually things I believe in and would use on my own car. This also means that I am not being paid to review something I do not care about. Would I do a review if a sponsor reached out to me? The answer would depend on if I believed in the product, and I would make it clear in my review if this were the case. But at the time of writing this review, such an interaction has not occurred yet.Time of writing disclaimer: everything I am writing about in this review is described at the time of writing and may not be updated in the future, so there is a potential that things are no longer accurate in my comparisons as parts are changed and upgraded as time passes.Bias and comparison disclaimer: Throughout this review I will attempt to be as unbiased as possible while drawing comparisons to other products.Mistakes and Inaccuracies Disclaimer: Throughout my review I will try to be as factually accurate as possible, but there are always chances that I make mistakes and write things that are incorrect/false. If this is the case please point it out to me and if indeed it is true that I am incorrect, I will correct these mistakes and apologize for them. Afterall I am only human, so mistakes can and will inevitably happen.Subjective Disclaimer: Please note, these reviews are also written in my own opinion, so when I am comparing different products to determine what I see as the best, there are many factors that I go through to form this opinion. Obviously there will be disagreements between people, so I will do my best to objectively determine what I deem to be the best, but at the end of the day it is still just my own opinion whether it be right or wrong. Take whatever I say in my reviews with a grain of salt.Image Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the respective image owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.Review Disclaimer:First and foremost I would like to thank Burger Motorsports for agreeing to sponsor me for this review. Despite this I will remain as unbiased as possible during the review. Please note, the dynamics of this relationship was that I reached out for a sponsorship review and not the other way around. This should demonstrate how I truly feel about the BMS BMW Jack Pad Adapter - in the sense that I truly believe it is the best jack pad adapter on the market, and that every BMW owner should have at least one. In fact I actually have 4 of these Jack Pad Adapters and have been using them ever since I received them in late July (I used them to install: my 034 motorsports front and rear brake rotors, my Spiegler stainless steel brake lines, my paragon titanium brake shims, my paragon brake temperature stickers, and my Automotive Passion rear mud flaps).Customer Service, Shipping, and Overall Experience Dealing with BMS:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceLets begin with customer service, shipping, and the overall experience. I have said this in the past and I will say it again, BMS has some of the best customer service in the entire BMW community. They are responsive when answering emails, and are friendly, patient, and polite (Thanks again Payam). Shipping was great, BMS uses FedEx International Connect Plus which allowed for economical and fast shipping even across international borders (USA to Canada). BMS also uses quality ULine boxes (not some cheap Chinese boxes) with proper Box certificates and they package the box incredibly nicely with plenty of brown paper stuffing. Now you may wonder why is this even important? Well to answer that question it has everything to do with shipping insurance. If your package is ever damaged FedEx or UPS or any other carrier will ask for photo evidence of the packaging to make sure it was sufficiently packed and protected. They will then ask for the box certificate number to ensure that the box was strong enough for the items packed within. If any of these are not within spec, then your insurance claim may be denied. This is why packaging is so important, and BMS has perfectly nailed this criteria.So overall, customer service, shipping, and my experience dealing with BMS has been great, no real complaints!BMW Factory Jacking Point:Before we can go on and discuss the BMS jack pad adapters I would first like to go over the factory BMW jacking points, because understanding these things will help us understand why we even need jack pad adapters.Credit: ECS Tuninghttps://www.ecstuning.com/b-genuine-...h/51717169981/Credit: ECS Tuninghttps://www.ecstuning.com/b-genuine-...h/51717169981/So essentially all BMWs from 2006 and onwards had the exact same jacking point design pictured above, and the part number is: 51717169981https://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/par...&q=51717169981The problem with this plastic jacking point is that it was never meant to support the weight of the car on its raised edges. It was actually meant to act as a receptacle to guide an adapter into its rectangular middle section, and then have that adapter be used to lift the car. So the only portion of this adapter that was meant to bear weight was the internal flat section, not the raised walls of the rectangle.This is an example (and a really mild example as well) of what will happen if you jack the car up directly on the jacking points:Credit: .Slughttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...21&postcount=1The soft plastic is not designed to hold the weight of the car, so it will crumble and break apart. This means that these jacking points cannot be used to lift the car, but it isnt safe to leave the car directly on these jacking points because if it suddenly crumbles the car can drop. This is why you need jack pad adapters.What are Jack Pad Adapters?So now the question is, what are jack pad adapters? Jack pad adapters are typically adapters that fit into these recessed rectangular jacking points on the BMW, and adapt this rectangular shape into something that sticks out and has a nice flat surface that can sit nicely on a jack pad (the flat surface of your hydraulic jack pad meant for lifting) or flat top jack stand. These Jack Pad Adapters are typically made of rubber or aluminum.BMS Aluminium BMW Jack Pad Adapter:Now lets examine the BMS Aluminium BMW Jack Pad Adapter:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo now that we have more detailed images of the BMS Jack Pad adapters, lets discuss some of its features that make it better than the aluminum competition:1) Textured (grooved) bottom: I havent seen this on any other jack pad adapter, and this is a really really nice feature to have. The reason why having grooves cut into the bottom of the jack pad adapter is so nice is because it increases the amount of surface area being in contact with the surface of the jack pad, and therefore increases the amount of grip these jack pad adapters have to the jack. So I know you might be asking, how is this the case? Because slick tires offer more grip than grooved tires. Well the answer to that question is due to the depth of the grooves and material the grooves are cut into. With tires the depth of the grooves have to be really deep to help evacuate water from the contact patch, and the rubber material of the tire buckles easier under load when the tread divides them into individual blocks - and this buckling reduces grip because the tread blocks move around. Whereas with these jack pad adapters, the grooves are very shallow and since the jack pads are made of aluminum which is rigid and doesnt buckle under load. So the result is that these shallow grooves actually dig into the rubber surface of the jack pad and bite into them, this offers more surface area to contact the jack pad increasing grip, and the biting action further helps lock the jack pad in place. So having this grooved bottom is a really nice touch that BMS adds.2) Height: The BMS Jack Pads have a rectangular section that is a bit taller than the depth of the BMW jacking point. This is a really nice feature because when load is applied to the Jack Pad adapter, the plastic jacking point may compress a bit and this brings the circular base of the jack pad adapter closer to the surrounding raised lip of the plastic jacking point. If the jack pad adapters rectangular sections height was identical to the depth of the jacking point then the circular base would be resting on the raised walls of the jacking point before any load is applied to the jack pad adapter. This means as soon as any load is applied to the jack pad adapter during lifting the car, the plastic jacking point compressed down a bit then the jack pad adapter will immediately begin applying load to the raised walls of the jacking point. This can damage the walls over time and is something we wanted to avoid by having these jack pad adapters. So the small buffer BMS puts in place by having the jack pad adapter being slightly taller than the depth of the jacking point is extremely nice, and I dont think many other competitors do this.3) Shape: The BMS jack pad adapters dont have a perfectly rectangular top section, they are actually slightly trapezoidal (its hard to see in the images but that is indeed the case). Again this is a really really smart design choice by BMS that I havent seen on any competitors. So this shape is smart because it allows the BMS jack pad adapters to be easier to locate into the plastic jacking point because the top is slightly smaller than the rectangular opening of the jacking point. Then the trapezoidal sides also allows the jack pad adapter to self-adjust as it slides into the jacking point if it is off center. So if it is slightly off the angled sides will push it over a bit as the jack pad adapter slides into the rectangular recess, so this is a really nice touch by BMS.BMS Jack Pad in Use:Next I would like to add some images showing the BMS Jack Pad Adapter in use:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceBMS Jack Pad Adapters vs. the cheaper rubber Competition:Now I would like to compare the BMS Jack Pad adapters to the cheaper rubber competition typically found on aliexpress, ebay, and amazon:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo from left to right we have the: BMS BMW Jack Pad Adapter, an Aliexpress/Amazon rubber BMW jack pad adapter, and an Aliexpress/Amazon Mercedes jack pad adapter. I am including a Mercedes specific jack pad adapter because the rectangular portion is the same width and length as the BMW jack pad adapters, they are just taller which is something that I will go into more detail shortly.Now lets look at how they fit into the BMW jacking point:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo the first thing we notice is that the Aliexpress/Amazon BMW jack pad adapter has the shortest rectangular top out of the 3 jack pad adapters - and this is a huge issue because it forces the base to press up against the jacking point and cause damage over time (this is an even bigger issue because rubber compresses a lot). The Aliexpress/Amazon Mercedes jack pad adapter has the tallest rectangular top out of the 3 jack pad adapters, but as a result it sticks quite far out of the jacking point which can cause instability if the rubber buckles, but it doesnt risk damaging the plastic walls on the BMW jacking point. The BMS jack pad adapter is the best out of the 3, with it being just a tiny bit taller than the depth of the BMW jacking point so it doesnt ever touch the plastic jacking point. It also isnt so tall that it would ever cause instability issues, and since it is aluminum it will never buckle.Finally I would like to look at long term use of these cheap rubber jack pad adapters and why you shouldnt waste your money on them:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo these are my Mercedes rubber jack pad adapters (images above), and what you will notice is the rubber has cracked all over the place due to the plastic buckling under load. Eventually if you keep using them too much they will fail all the way through and break apart, this is what happened and I had to throw one of them away.This is why you shouldnt waste your money on cheaper rubber jack pad adapters, because not only are they not the correct height, but imo they are not durable at all and will fail over time.Summary:So overall the BMS jack pad adapters are an extremely nice and high quality tool that all BMW owners should have, and I personally think you should have a set of 4. If you work on your own car you should have these adapters to properly jack up your car and place the entire car on jack stands. If you don't work on your car having a set of 4 means you will always be prepared to have your car properly lifted up no matter where you go. For example if you take your car to the tire shop where they may not have BMW specific jack pad adapters, you can lend the shop these adapters so that they wont ever damage your car while lifting it up in the air to do the tire change. So having a set of 4 will always keep you prepared no matter where you take your car.So if you want to buy a set of BMS jack pad adapters heres a link:https://burgertuning.com/collections...ck-pad-adapter\n\nReserved for future posts.\n\nNice review - new info even for such a simple item.

I'd suggest you just use a Stanley knife to trim the underside of that rubber pad you've bought so it fits into the lift plate.I have the Toolpro jack stands (the 3 ton 2 pin type rather than ratchet you've shown) which have a similar V top.  For safety reasons I would not use a solid metal jack pad directly onto those jack stands (or any jack stand that wasn't designed to receive/hold the solid flat surfaced jack pad).  I just wouldn't trust my life to the vehicle weight preventing movement of metal on metal especially when tightening some of the higher torque bolts.  I've been using the same rubber pads (will put a link below) for 6yrs and they are still in perfect condition, they flex into the jack stand top making for a very solid/sturdy hold, literally you cannot move the car when it's up on 4 stands no matter how hard you push on the car.  Just make sure you get the pads where the rubber circle base extends out beyond the raised rectrangular part,  there are cheaper types which are smaller and the rubber not as durable (I'd bought a set to take to track not knowing).https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/23528848...3ABFBMqMfFj89j\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byterrywangThanks for the review, this seems to be an often ignored must have.I have question regarding how to use the jack pad adaptersI understand I'll be using the adapters when using my low profile (3000kg) trolley jack to jack up the car, the jack is like belowI have purchased a rubber pad to make it work with my other cars without doing damagehttps://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B07V32536W/Based on your image, under the adapter there was something lese (aluminium), is it something else I need to buy to make it work with the BMS jack pad adapter?Once the car is jacked up, I need to use the jack to slowly lower it onto the jack stands, are t he adapters supposed to directly sit on the stands (like below)?ThanksSo the jack pad adapter sits on the rubber jack saddle as is, just center it and you are ok.For the jack stands you can't use the jack pad adapter with conventional jack stands - it is not safe. You will need flat top jack stands like this:https://esco.net/product/3-ton-perfo...ck-stand-pair/Then take the rubber tops off these esco jack stands and there is a little recessed \"cup\" where the jack pad adapters can sit and not risk sliding off.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceSo the jack pad adapter sits on the rubber jack saddle as is, just center it and you are ok.For the jack stands you can't use the jack pad adapter with conventional jack stands - it is not safe.

You'll use the jacks to lift the car onto the ramps - 2 jacks to simulatenously lift the back  up onto the ramps and then do the front. You want the rear on ramps first because it has parking brakes and you can leave it in gear.4 ramps are also really cheap compared to 4 esco jack stands, and this is what I use currently. The only con is that you cant do any jobs that require the wheels to be off, so that's what I currently use my jack rod for (plus axle stands etc, but that's a different setup and story).2) buy the jack stands, then you want to measure how high your jack can lift the car rather than how tall the jack stand is. That influences what jack stand you can get. If the jack is too short you'll prop it on something like I stack large planks of wood to give my jack extra height to lift my SUV.  Make sure it's really wide so there's no chance it can roll off.3) renn stands: these are the most convenient jack stands. But they're not cheap.4) quick jack: really expensive but very convenient, problem is it's hard to store since they're big and take up a lot of space.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceThe issue is where would you put this on the front end of the car?

So it's not an all encompassing solution. Its also a reason why I don't use standard jack stands to lift my car.I only ever use jack stands (with jack pads) under the side jack points of the car after I have raised it using a jack under the front centre point and centre of rear subframe.  I first drive onto some diy ramps to raise the front 60mm so I can get the jack under the front.Depending on the working height I need/want I'll first get the car on 4 stands at their lowest setting then jack front again & raise before raising the rear again.  To go to the stands highest setting takes more time, likewise when lowering I'll only do 1 step each end.  Better to be safe than rush and make a mistake.  I did think about a quickjack, lifting would be quicker but I don't know under car access would be any better and it's $$$ more expensive and bulkier to store away.I just find the good rubber jack pads with those jack stands I linked to provide a very secure and stable working environment, even using the stands at their highest setting the car won't move.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDavid.mI only ever use jack stands (with jack pads) under the side jack points of the car after I have raised it using a jack under the front centre point and centre of rear subframe.

For instance how confident are you leaning back and then lunging forward and shoving your car with full body weight as hard as you can? Because I wouldn't be with a car supported on a jack pad that is supported by only a few cm's of surface area by a claw jack stand. especially with a rubber jack pad that cracks and deforms under the cars weight. I've had almost every single style of rubber jack pad on the market and they all sucked.Now the reason why I prefer ramps (and utilize the bms jack pad adapters sheerly for jacking up the car, and for jobs where I need to remove all 4 wheels) is because of the significantly larger contact patch and stability this provides. I can literally run full speed and body slam the car and it will not move. This is great for high torque applications under the car - i.e. those massive torque to yield fasteners. I also have 4 bmw x5 scissor jacks at all 4 jack points + 2 jack stands on the rear subframe for even more additional security (I have 2 additional jack stands that I can use on the front subframe too - if they dont get in the way, but they don't hold much load so I don't risk damaging the frame), because I will take no chances while working under my car. The combined weight rating of all of these lifting devices also exceeds 20,000 lbs, so im fairly confident nothing will ever happen with my setup.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourcequick jack: really expensive but very convenient, problem is it's hard to store since they're big and take up a lot of space.Ive found they store out of the way quite nicely.

Torque for the rear eccentric bolt/nut is 165Nm and to get leverage with my big torque wrench I had the stands in the highest position (had to put jack on a platform to get the height) and car was still rock solid.Your reviews are great but I think it's fair to say not necessarily the last word.  eg the oil filter cap tool, I have one which looks identical to your 'Amazon' one though I bought from ebay over 6yrs ago.  Mine is a perfect fit on the cap,  I've done I think 17 oil changes and not a mark on the cap.  I did buy the spark plug gap tool you reviewed, it's fantastic compared to the old way of tapping plug on the bench.  I only posted in the thread as I didn't see the point of Terry wasting (my opinion) money when other tools much cheaper are available, down here at the bottom of the world availability is often an issue not to mention crazy pricing.  cheers\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDavid.mWe'll just have to agree that our opinion/experiences differ regarding the jack stands/jack pads and I wouldn't concede mine are less valid/reliable.In the 6.5yrs I've had this car it's been up on these stands using the same set of rubber jack pads probably 90-100 times, never any damage to the car mount points & pads are as good as when I first got them.No I haven't 'lunged' at the car (doesn't sound good for the body panelsbut have pushed against the top of the roof rail as hard as my 180cm 83kg body can and car was rock solid, likewise firmly shutting door even starting engine.Maybe the most challenging work I've so far done for the stands was the rear springs/coilovers.

So this always will pose more of a chance that they fail when on claw style jack stands.I don't intend for my reviews to be the last word, I just give my take and you the buyer make the decision if you want it or not. I don't control how you spend your money, I can just offer my opinion.Yeah my amazon oil filter tool is a tiny bit too large, and every time I put torque on it, it rotates on the cap and the cap gets stuck inside, and this \"mars\" the corners of the oil filter cap. Then the ebay stamped steel one just doesn't fit at all. The reason why yours likely doesn't have an issue is production tolerances of the tool and the cap, then the issue is compounded because the tool is designed to be a tiny bit larger for additional wiggle room on all sorts of filter caps - not just bmw. Then that causes issues for caps that might be a bit too small like mine. So I find the BMS tool to be better because they removed some of the extra tolerance that wasn't needed, because it only has to fit BMW's so the fitment is alot more snug and doesn't spin.I opted out of the spark plug tool because I don't like magnets picking up weakly ferrometallic debris that could end up falling off and into the cylinder. So I use a friction retention style spark plug gap tool instead. The BMS spark plug gapping tool is indeed excellent.But my opinion on the jack pad adapters remain the same, it is really nice to have aluminium ones that don't fall apart. I've had many sets of rubber ones and all of them failed - as you can see from my pictures. So after spending a bunch of money buying the same part multiple times, I deciced it is probably best to buy metal ones that wont have to be replaced.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjefe2000Ive found they store out of the way quite nicely. See photo.And yeah: definitely expensive. Though they pay for themselves after a couple years by allowing me to not visit the dealership service department for common maintenance tasks on both my vehicles.Yeah I thought of wall hanging mine too, but I don't have room for 2 on my wall just 1. Since I have a giant window where my car is parked. Then the other areas in my garage is where I park my 2 other cars, put my bikes, lawn mower, snow blower, leaf blower, air compressor, tools, etc. So for me I don't have room for the quick jacks and the hydraulic motor. I like ramps because they're small, very light weight and I can stack them on top of each other and they take not much space.Maybe one day I will get a set of quick jacks but probably not soon. Maybe when I get an attic lift then I can store them in my garage attic. But that would involve me having to actually put plywood boards so I can actually walk up there.\n\nI have one of the BMS jack pad adapters, and it is a nicely made solid piece.  But, I find that I rarely use it.  Mine is black, and I found it hard to line up because I couldn't see it well.  I have some cheaper hard nylon jack pads that are a light grey.  The nylon is much stiffer and more durable than the cheap rubber adapters.  Work just as well as my fancy black BMS jack pad, and I can see them.  Sadly, I can't find them on Amazon anymore to provide a link.I also don't bother with the jack pads when using my Esco flat top jack stands.  The pads add a fiddly step to line them up perfectly.  I just let the plastic jack sockets on the car rest on the rubber pads on the Esco jack stands.  There has been no noticeable impact on the jack sockets.  And I figure if the BMW dealership is just using flat rubber pads on their lifts, it will work fine on my jack stands.\n\nRecently I came across an innovative tool (adapter) made by Forsvara EngineeringIt leverages common jack stands and turn it into a nice jack stand that work form F chassis BMWhttps://forsvaraengineering.com/shop...3-4-ton-standsThe only thing I am not sure is that for the jackstand I am using (3000kg), see above, the post thickness is 1.1in (~28mm), the top is thicker/wider at around ~1.62in (41.2mm) +3in (75.2mm) wide top. I am having trouble measuring it against the diagram since it doesn't scale right, I am drawing a diagram for my own saddle to double check with the manufacturer since it'll be costly and time consuming to return/change since I don't live in the US.\n\nI use the BMS jack pad adapters as well.  But every time I have to jack up the car, I wish I had the Reverse Logic jack pad adapters that have 4 spring loaded pins to hold it in place.From a quick google, doesn't look like they make them for BMW anymore (or they went out of business), but I recall seeing ads in the Roundel years ago.  They looked like these MB ones:",

OK to use the alcohol-based ones.  The dealer said they'd had so many of these cases that they warned new owners specifically (and then wouldn't cover it if you went ahead and jacked it up).",

The tend to break meaning the valve can no longer be controlled by the actuator. Youll need to buy a new flexing bow.  Part is maybe $15 from a dealer. Youll also need a way to electronically move the actuator since it tends to overextend its position when the flexing bow breaks loose. Theres some videos on YouTube, but dont force the actuator into position with a screwdriver or something. Youll need to use something like BM3 to get the actuator to rotate.\n\nAwesome, and thanks for the help! I'm getting a service in the next month probably - should I try to do this myself or have the dealership do this? (knowing of course it'll be much more costly to have them do it)\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygravity7Awesome, and thanks for the help!

(knowing of course it'll be much more costly to have them do it)It's not that hard to do as long as you don't mind crawling under the back of the car. If you park it somewhere with the nose pointed downhill, then you have enough space to scoot under the backside. Search the forums for \"exhaust flexing bow\", and you'll find the part number. Maybe $15. Read this post for a key detail when trying to install the flexing bow.https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1869651\n\nIf you don't want to mess with it, then I couldn't imagine a shop charging more than $150 to fix it. It might be about 15 minutes of work for someone with experience to fix it.",

    "title": "BMS Titanium Coolant Bleeder Screw Review",
    "content": "Credit: Burger Motorsportshttps://burgertuning.com/products/ti...a4da5e36&_ss=rIntroduction:In this product review I will be taking a look at the BMS Titanium Coolant Bleeder Screw and why I think its one of the best bleeder screws if not the best one available on the market, and why I think any BMW owner who has a car that utilizes this type of bleeder screw should have one.So if youre interested in this product heres a purchase link:https://burgertuning.com/products/ti...a4da5e36&_ss=rDisclaimer:Damage/Injury Disclaimer: Any information, guidance, technical advice, coding advice, tuning advice, datalogging advice, installation instruction, calculation, experiment, safety information, or product installation demonstrated in my reviews is to be consumed/read/understood/followed and or done at your own risk. I will not be responsible/held liable for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Monetary disclaimer: I do not make commission, or profits or any kind of monetary gain from the sale of the BMS Titanium Coolant Bleeder Screw.Sponsorship disclaimer: The way my reviews work is that I determine what product that I want to buy and actually use on my own car, and during this process the product that I end up choosing is what I believe is the best option on the market. I then reach out to the company offering the product and ask them if they would be willing to sponsor me in a review, if the answer is yes then I write a review, if the answer is no I would end up buying the product (sometimes at a later date) but I wouldnt complete a detailed review about it (I might write something, but not to the same extent as my standard reviews). But the critical thing is that I reach out for a sponsorship and not the other way around, this means that the products I am reviewing are actually things I believe in and would use on my own car. This also means that I am not being paid to review something I do not care about. Would I do a review if a sponsor reached out to me? The answer would depend on if I believed in the product, and I would make it clear in my review if this were the case. But at the time of writing this review, such an interaction has not occurred yet.Time of writing disclaimer: everything I am writing about in this review is described at the time of writing and may not be updated in the future, so there is a potential that things are no longer accurate in my comparisons as parts are changed and upgraded as time passes.Bias and comparison disclaimer: Throughout this review I will attempt to be as unbiased as possible while drawing comparisons to other products.Mistakes and Inaccuracies Disclaimer: Throughout my review I will try to be as factually accurate as possible, but there are always chances that I make mistakes and write things that are incorrect/false. If this is the case please point it out to me and if indeed it is true that I am incorrect, I will correct these mistakes and apologize for them. Afterall I am only human, so mistakes can and will inevitably happen.Subjective Disclaimer: Please note, these reviews are also written in my own opinion, so when I am comparing different products to determine what I see as the best, there are many factors that I go through to form this opinion. Obviously there will be disagreements between people, so I will do my best to objectively determine what I deem to be the best, but at the end of the day it is still just my own opinion whether it be right or wrong. Take whatever I say in my reviews with a grain of salt.Information Disclaimer: I read a lot of material over the years just out of sheer interest or to make these reviews. I also accumulated a lot of knowledge over my many years of education that are really relevant to cars (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics). That being said, my reviews are mostly based on this accumulated knowledge and I cannot always cite these sources due to the original source material possibly being lost to time, or there being so much knowledge compiled to make a single point. So, when possible I will cite my source(s) (for example data on tensile strength of a metal, or peer reviewed research). There are cases when I get information from blog posts, youtube videos, or forum posts I may not cite it, because I go through a lot of these sources only to use the gained knowledge in a small section of my review and it is not feasible to list them all. So pretty much what I am trying to say is I am not citing common knowledge - I will cite peer reviewed research and photos though (if applicable or used), or really explicit user experiences (if applicable or used).Image Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the respective image owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.Review Disclaimer:First and foremost I would like to thank Burger Motorsport for agreeing to sponsor me for this review. Despite this I will remain as unbiased as possible during the review. Please note, the dynamics of this relationship was that I reached out for a sponsorship review and not the other way around. This should demonstrate how I truly feel about the BMS Titanium Coolant Bleeder Screw - in the sense that I truly believe it is truly an excellent bleeder screw and one of the best ones available on the market. In fact I actually have this bleeder screw installed on my own m2 as of now, and I really love the durability/reliability it adds to my car.What Are Bleeder Screws Used For?:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceThe first topic I would like to talk about is what these bleeder screws are used for, and how to properly use them. So like the name suggests the bleeder screws are used for bleeding the cooling system, more specifically it is used to bleed the air bubbles out of the cooling system. The reason why these allow for air to be bled out of the cooling system is because the bleeder screw portion of the coolant expansion tank is the highest point of the cooling loop, because it is connected to the expansion hose which is connected to the coolant outlet from the oil filter housing - and this is the highest coolant outlet on the engine block and also the highest connection on the radiator. So all air bubbles from the cooling loop will exit the highest part of the engine block and the highest part of the radiator as the coolant level rises, and then get accumulated at this expansion hose. The air bubbles will then be forced through the expansion hose and into the expansion tank right to where the bleeder screw is. This allows the bleeder screw to bleed off all the air bubbles in the cooling system, and here is an image to help explain what I mean:Credit: Photo from JWBIEREs M235i and edited by F87Sourcehttps://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comment...an_engine_bay/1) the box labeled 1 is the bleeder screw, this is the highest point in the expansion tank that can be used for bleeding, it is also where the expansion line connects to the tank and where coolant can actually return to the expansion tank after going through the entire cooling loop.2) The circle labeled 2 is the expansion hose, you will notice one end connects to the expansion tank and the second connects to the coolant outlet hose from the engine.3) The box labeled 3 is the coolant outlet hose from the engine, in particular the side that connects to the radiator. This is also the highest connection point on the radiator so all bubbles from the radiator will accumulate here.4) The box labeled 4 is the coolant outlet hose from the engine, in particular the side that connects to the oil filter housing. Again this is the highest connection point on the engine so all bubbles from the engine block will accumulate here.So in summary all of the air bubbles from the engine and radiator should collect in the coolant outlet hose as outlined in 3 and 4, and as the coolant level keeps rising there will be nowhere for the air to go except out via the coolant expansion line outlined in 2. This will lead to the coolant bleeder hose 1 and where the air can exit.Now how do you properly use the bleeder screw? Well the bleeder screw should only be opened during the filling of the cooling system, and not during the bleed procedure as you can risk making a huge mess and BMW stipulates to keep the expansion tank closed during bleeding. So what you will do is open the bleeder screw fully, then fill the expansion tank via the normal cap and keep filling it until coolant comes out from the bleeder screw. Once this happens essentially most of the air has been forced out of the cooling loop. Then close up the expansion tank and run the built in bleed procedure, if the coolant level drops repeat the procedure until the coolant level remains steady. Once it does siphon the coolant out of the expansion tank until it is at the mid level (the seam).Stock Bleeder Screw Issues:Now I would like to discuss the issues that commonly happen to the stock bleeder screw, and are the reasons why you should upgrade to a metal bleeder screw.1) Broken head:Credit: 6plsshootme9https://www.reddit.com/r/BmwTech/com...tom_half_of_a/Credit: crdiscoverer'shttps://www.bimmerforums.com/forum/s...r-screw-threadAs you can see above, the head of the stock plastic bleeder screw can break off the threads of the screw and this can be lodged in the expansion tank. This occurs when the threads on the bleeder screw get seized to the expansion tank (the coolant on the threads dries and just binds the threads up), and when you try to unscrew the bleeder screw itll just snap off. When this happens it is an extremely tedious task to try and drill out the threads and extract that broken screw, so this is a reason to upgrade to a metal aftermarket bleeder screw that cannot snap off.2) Leaks:Credit: symonh2000https://www.babybmw.net/threads/leak...-screw.151998/The stock bleeder screw uses imo a sub par o-ring that can deteriorate and crack over time, or get flattened and not rebound. This leads to an O-ring that leaks over time, and obviously this is not a good thing because you are losing coolant. Also if the o-ring cant seal the cooling system is open and therefore it cannot build pressure and thus the boiling point of the coolant is decreased so you risk boiling your coolant and ending your driving session - whether that be spirited driving on the street or on the track.3) Stripped screw:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceThe last issue that commonly occurs to the stock bleeder screw is the head gets easily stripped out due to the plastic becoming old and brittle. So what happens is that as you use a screwdriver to remove the bleeder screw, the plastic just cannot handle the load you are putting on it and the head of the bleeder screw strips out. Sometimes it is just a minor issue and you are still able to remove your bleeder screw - this is what happened to me as you can see above where a corner broke off. But it can completely strip out to the point where you can no longer use a screwdriver on the bleeder screw and now you are left trying to drill out the stripped out bleeder screw. So again this is another reason to upgrade to a metal bleeder screw.BMS Coolant Using the Bleeder Screw:Finally lets take a look at the BMS coolant bleeder screw.Compatibility:First I would like to go over vehicle compatibility, and what cars can utilize this upgraded BMS coolant bleeder screw.If your BMWs coolant expansion tank utilizes this type of bleeder screw - part number: 11537793373Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceYou can utilize the upgraded BMS coolant bleeder screw.Furthermore heres a real oem compatibility list:https://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/par...&q=115377933731' E81   (02/2006  12/2011)1' E87   (02/2003  02/2007)1' E87 LCI   (01/2006  06/2011)1' E88   (11/2006  10/2013)1' E82   (11/2006  10/2013)1' F20   (07/2010  02/2015)1' F20 LCI   (05/2014  06/2019)1' F21   (07/2010  02/2015)1' F21 LCI   (05/2014  06/2019)2' F22   (10/2012  06/2017)2' F22 LCI   (09/2016  12/2019)2' F87 M2   (11/2014  06/2017)2' F87 M2 LCI   (09/2016  06/2018)2' F23   (03/2014  06/2017)2' F23 LCI   (09/2016  12/2019)3' E46   (04/1997  12/2018)3' E90   (02/2004  09/2008)3' E90 LCI   (07/2007  02/2012)3' E91   (02/2004  08/2008)3' E91 LCI   (07/2007  05/2012)3' E92   (05/2005  02/2010)3' E92 LCI   (11/2008  06/2013)3' E93   (09/2005  02/2010)3' E93 LCI   (11/2008  10/2013)3' F30   (02/2011  01/2016)3' F30 LCI   (09/2014  03/2019)3' G20   (10/2017  01/2020)3' F31   (07/2011  07/2015)3' F31 LCI   (09/2014  06/2019)3' G21   (05/2018  12/2019)3' F34 GT   (07/2012  06/2016)3' F34 GT LCI   (09/2015  01/2020)3' F35   (06/2011  08/2015)3' F35 LCI   (01/2015  03/2019)3' G28   (01/2018  12/2019)4' F32   (11/2012  02/2017)4' F32 LCI   (05/2016  12/2019)4' F33   (03/2013  02/2017)4' F33 LCI   (05/2016  12/2019)4' F36 Gran Coupé   (07/2013  03/2017)4' F36 Gran Coupé LCI   (05/2016  12/2019)5' E39   (12/1997  12/2003)5' E60   (02/2002  02/2007)5' E60 LCI   (10/2005  12/2009)5' E61   (11/2002  02/2007)5' E61 LCI   (11/2005  05/2010)5' F07 GT LCI   (08/2012  02/2017)5' F10   (06/2010  06/2013)5' F10 LCI   (10/2012  10/2016)5' F11   (06/2010  06/2013)5' F11 LCI   (10/2012  02/2017)5' F18   (03/2011  08/2013)5' F18 LCI   (10/2012  04/2017)5' G30   (10/2015  01/2020)5' G31   (03/2016  12/2019)5' G38   (02/2016  12/2019)6' E63 LCI   (05/2006  07/2010)6' E64 LCI   (04/2006  07/2010)6' G32 GT   (09/2016  01/2020)7' E38   (12/1997  07/2001)7' E65   (11/2001  07/2008)7' E66   (03/2005  07/2008)7' G11   (10/2014  02/2019)7' G11 LCI   (01/2018  01/2020)7' G12   (10/2014  02/2019)7' G12 LCI   (01/2018  01/2020)8' G14   (06/2018  12/2019)8' G15   (06/2018  12/2019)8' G16 Gran Coupé   (05/2018  12/2019)i8 I12   (02/2013  02/2018)i8 I12 LCI   (11/2016  11/2019)i8 I15   (01/2017  11/2019)X1 E84   (09/2008  12/2015)X3 E83   (01/2003  07/2006)X3 E83 LCI   (02/2006  08/2010)X3 F25   (02/2011  08/2017)X4 F26   (05/2013  03/2018)X5 E53   (01/2000  09/2006)X5 E70   (02/2006  06/2013)X5 E70 LCI   (04/2009  06/2013)X5 F15   (08/2012  06/2018)X5 M F85   (04/2013  06/2018)X5 G05   (09/2017  01/2020)X6 E71   (01/2007  06/2014)X6 E72 Hybrid   (10/2008  10/2011)X6 F16   (09/2013  05/2019)X6 M F86   (10/2013  05/2019)X6 G06   (06/2018  01/2020)X7 G07   (11/2017  12/2019)Z4 E85   (01/2002  08/2008)Z4 E86   (10/2005  08/2008)Z4 E89   (01/2008  08/2016)Z4 G29   (10/2017  12/2019)MINI R56 LCI   (03/2009  11/2013)MINI Clubman R55 LCI   (03/2009  06/2014)MINI Cabrio R57 LCI   (04/2009  06/2015)MINI Coupé R58   (12/2010  05/2015)MINI Roadster R59   (01/2011  04/2015)MINI Countryman R60   (01/2010  10/2016)MINI Paceman R61   (03/2012  09/2016)Phantom RR11   (09/2016  12/2019)Phantom EWB RR12   (09/2016  11/2019)Ghost RR4   (08/2008  11/2019)Wraith RR5   (11/2012  12/2019)Dawn RR6   (04/2015  11/2019)Cullinan RR31   (10/2017  12/2019)Zinoro M12   (01/2013  07/2015)MS BMW Motorsport   (  )So if your vehicle is listed above, the BMS coolant bleeder screw is compatible.Images:Now lets take a quick look at some images of the BMS bleeder screw:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSpecifications and Analysis:Moving on lets examine the BMS Titanium Coolant Bleeder screw in further detail:1) Grade 5 aerospace titanium: The BMS coolant bleeder screw is CNC machined from Grade 5 aerospace titanium, this makes the bleeder screw extremely strong and resistant to corrosion. So you will never ever have to worry about the bleeder screw snapping off, corroding/aging and failing over time, or having the head strip ever again.2) Viton O-ring:Credit: F87SourceThe BMS coolant bleeder screw utilizes an extremely high quality viton O-ring making it extremely resistant to all types of chemicals - in particular antifreeze and petroleum products (incase you unfortunately had an OFHG fail and oil ends up in your cooling system). These high quality O-rings are also very resistant to deformation and rebound after being flattened, this means you can reuse them over and over again and not have to worry about them not being able to reseal the expansion tank. These O-rings will also be very resistant to degradation and dry rotting due to ozone and engine bay heat.3) 4 mm Allen head:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceThe BMS coolant bleeder screw utilizes a 4 mm Allen head, this makes it  alot easier to tighten and loosen the bleeder screw without slipping off vs. an extremely large and shallow phillips head on the stock bleeder screw.4) M10 X 1.0 Threads:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceThe BMS coolant bleeder screw utilizes M10 X 1.0 threads just like the stock bleeder screw, and thus it will fit without any issues or thread damage.Now I would also like to address the concern I have heard with metal bleeder screws, and that they expand at different rates vs. the stock plastic threads in the expansion tank and thus running them long term will cause issues and damage to the threads in the expansion tank. Well my response is that simple isnt true, because the stock plastic expansion tank has a metal female thread insert for the bleeder screw to screw into. So this makes the aforementioned concern moot.Credit: F87SourceAlternatives:Finally the last thing I would like to quickly discuss is the alternative bleeder screws that you typically find on aliexpress, ebay, or amazon - and these are the brass bleeder screws.Credit: TAKPARThttps://www.amazon.ca/TAKPART-Upgrad.../dp/B07CHJ4W9MSo the issue with these bleeder screws mainly revolves around 2 areas:1) the o-ring: these bleeder screws typically use really cheap O-rings that may get flattened and not rebound after use, and this means they will leak the next time you reuse the bleeder screw. Or they are not very chemical resistant and will swell and crack over time after exposure to the coolant, or even dry rot due to ozone or engine bay heat.2) Threads: sometimes these cheaper bleeder screws were really poorly made and have very rough threads that can gall and damage the threads in the expansion tank.Installation Tips:Installation is fairly simple, you remove the stock bleeder screw with a phillips screwdriver and install the new one with a 4 mm hex key. I would also recommend using pure undiluted antifreeze as lubrication for the O-ring, the reason why is it will not dry out as easily and this helps prevent seizing.Installed Images:Finally here are some images of the stock bleeder screw vs. the BMS titanium coolant bleeder screw, and the BMS bleeder screw fully installed in my car:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceHow to Bleed Your Coolant Using the Bleeder Screw:Here are some detailed steps on how to bleed your coolant:- First you will ensure the entire cooling system is put back together before starting. Then you will remove the bleeder screw on the expansion tank:Credit: F87SourceAfter this is done, you will fill the expansion tank until coolant comes out of the bleeder screw, since this is connected to the expansion hose which is connected to the radiator hose from the oil filter housing (highest point in the cooling loop), filling the system until it overflows from this bleeder screw means it is filled to the absolute max and this will drive almost all the air out of the system.- Next you will suck out some of the additional coolant in the expansion tank to bring it down to the max line, and then tighten up the bleeder screw and close the expansion tank cap, and begin the built-in bleeding procedure.1) Connect a battery charger to the underhood jump terminals, do not connect to the battery directly or else you risk damaging the IBS.2) Switch the ignition to accessory mode, aka click the start stop button without your foot on the brake or clutch.3) Set high beam to low, set fan speed 1, set temperature to maximum for both zones, set driving mode to sport.4) Press the gas pedal to the floor and hold it there for ~10 seconds, you can let go when you hear the water pump start.The bleeding procedure will start and take 10-12 mins, and it will stop automatically afterwards. Check the coolant level in the expansion tank after this is done, and top it off to the middle line - which is the thick seam on this car. Or if you have too much coolant suck it out to the middle line.Repeat these steps until the coolant level no longer drops and no additional coolant needs to be added after the bleed cycle has been run. That is it! For me personally, the last time I did a coolant flush 4 years ago, I bled the system ~20-30 times just because I was paranoid, but it was probably done after 3-5 bleeds.Summary:So overall the BMS Coolant Bleeder screw is a fantastic little mod to have on your car, as it prevents you from running into trouble if your stock bleeder screw breaks and gets stuck in the expansion tank, or causes a cooling leak.If youre interested in purchasing one heres a link:https://burgertuning.com/products/ti...a4da5e36&_ss=r\n\nReserved for Future Posts.\n\nDammit, just when I stopped being influenced by your incredible reviews to spend money, you suck me back in!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDrKevM5Dammit, just when I stopped being influenced by your incredible reviews to spend money, you suck me back in!Haha thanks man. I got a lot more reviews coming this summer so stay buckled in haha.\n\nNice review, fitted one of these last year for preventative maintenance. Good product.👍\n\nThanks, F87source!Will probably do this bleeder screw replacement at my next coolant flush  in a year or two.Any recommendations on what type of battery charger is sufficient during the automated bleeding cycle? Will a trickle charger do?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjefe2000Thanks, F87source!Will probably do this bleeder screw replacement at my next coolant flush  in a year or two.Any recommendations on what type of battery charger is sufficient during the automated bleeding cycle? Will a trickle charger do?If your battery isn't on its last legs a standard trickle charger on supply mode is more than enough. That's what I've been using and I'm able to get multiple bleeds in a row without any sort of battery warning. Then I take a break and let the car charge up before doing it again.\n\nIf anyone wants/needs one of these I have an extra and will be happy to send it out at cost. BMS listed it as also fitting the R57, but turns out my wife's Mini uses a different expansion tank without this screw. It's not worth sending it back but it's also not something I feel like I need a spare of. Just drop me a DM.",

I can ask him.The logic is that the viscosity index improver polymers are shearing, causing the 100C viscosity to be out of grade. Fundamentally, you should need fewer VII polymers in a 5W than a 0W. Therefore, a 5W is more resistant to changing 100C viscosity when the VII polymers deplete.In the case of using a BMW Genuine oil in a BMW motor, and how consistent it is with every BMW 0w-30 oil analysis I've seen... this almost seems intentional. Oil chemistry is pretty interesting, and having worked directly with oil suppliers on vehicle formulations,... there is a balance of everything. Hypothetically, BMW may have used this specific VII polymer to balance against some other additive within the oil, which does something different. Maybe BMW considered using a 0W-20 with a more robust polymer, but that would be incompatible with some other additive they needed in the oil. So they made a 0w-30 that would shear down to a 0w-20. This type of balance and engineering goes into OE automotive stuff. And, of course, cost and supply chain availability come into play.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byE90convertThe logic is that the viscosity index improver polymers are shearing, causing the 100C viscosity to be out of grade.

When I asked for a quote on diff fluid replacement the quoted $700!! I said nah I'll do it.Is the BMW fluid special due to the friction modifiers that our diff requires?Anyway, just looking for what you all have experienced.\n\nGo somewhere else.

And last question. Do you go with the 992 or do you save a few bucks and use the Castrol? Are they the same. I'm fine with the factory fill. Just asking.\n\nUse the BMW 992 diff fluid. Buy 2 bottles. You will use ~1.3L/~1.4Q. You won't need to use a fluid transfer pump, because you can cut the tip of the nozzle on the diff fluid and squeeze the fluid into the fill hole.You will need 2x new diff plugs as these are one time use due to the O-ring.Bonus - You can buy Turner Motorsport's magnetic drain plug for the diff. The diff generates a lot of metal particles and this plug captures a LOT.Second Bonus - Buy your diff fluid from Turner/ECS/FCP Euro for free lifetime warranty/returns for future fluid and diff plug changes on your vehicle (excluding shipping charges).Product Links:TMS Magnetic Drain Plug -https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-5...x-socket-head/TMS Replacement O-Rings for Magnetic plug -https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-6...br-020-o-ring/OEM BMW Diff Plug (Part# 33117525064) -https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-7...ing-most-bmws/OEM BMW Diff Fluid -https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-2...uine-bmw-part/Torque for Diff Plugs - 45NM / 33 ft-lbs\n\nI've used Redline fluids in all my BMWs forever with great results and no failures.

If this is true (optimal temp is in the middle), why does it say \"OK\" way before reaching the middle?You'd presume BMW think it's OK to start using an extended rev range but it's not clear. Safest way is to stick to the centre position as that is fully warmed up. It also mentions in the book that if you have a DCT car and want to use launch control, to drive for about 6 miles. In my experience this is a similar distance (unless stood in traffic) that it takes to warm up fully ( so they're referring to it warming up fully again).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byakkandoI believe the \"cold\" and \"ok\" just refer to coolant temp.I never seen the blue and red bar \"needle\" go beyond the middle in street driving.

Take a look at any oil viscocity vs temperature curve.  At 50C most oils are already over 90% towards minimum viscosity.  Basically once you see the needle move past 70C on your M2 you are good to go as the viscosity changes as temperature increase from there are minimal at best.https://wiki.anton-paar.com/en/engine-oil/\n\nOK = Punch it\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMZWIEOK = Punch itokay means coolant up to temp, not oil.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byheavyD^2Gents.

Thanks.Typically you should change the oil every XXXX km or 4-5 years whatever comes first, the reason why is because oil still oxidizes with time even if you do not drive it.Personally I change the diff oil every 4 years and 30k - 40k km (I prefer to keep it on the lower end of the mileage count to minimize the amount of metallic shavings in the oil as that contributes to wear) whatever comes first, in order to ensure the diff oil is as clean as possible to minimize differential wear. This is because our diffs (well atleast in the early days which was pre 2016 my) were known to fail quite alot (you can google it and see), either with fluid that had too much friction modifiers or due to hard driving. I think this has been mostly resolved, but I try to be as proactive as possible with mainteance to ensure the diff is as healthy as possible (runs clean oil and minimize the amount of metal particles in said oil). This is because fluid is cheap and diffs are not.\n\nYes.  It should be changed based on age, not mileage.  I personally run Red Line diff fluid in both my stock 3.15 FD DCT diff and my 3.62 FD multi-clutch DCT diff.   There are no noises and no issues with using Red Line diff fluid.\n\nI believe BMW specs a 5 year service interval for normal use, so your due. This is fine for hard street driving, or occasional track use at a novice/intermediate level. If you are tracking it a significant amount or are tracking it while heavy modified (slicks, power increase, ect.) youll want to change it probably annually.Id recommend simply using the BMW OE fluid.Wear metals in oil causes oxidation, so yes it makes sense that it should be changed by age.",

    "content": "I recently bought one of my dream cars couple of weeks ago, a 2020 M2C with 7200 miles for a decent price. The car itself is great so far, wonderful power with great looks. The only issue I'm seeing is that the driver side DRL is quite a bit dimmer versus the passenger side, which I recently noticed when seeing my lights reflection off the backside of a car.Do I need to get a new headlight? I tried asking the local BMW dealership whether this is covered under warranty, but was told that it was only covered if it's broken, not dimming…\n\nThat looks \"broken\" to me\n\nThe dealer is full of ish, the headlight/module is covered under the factory warranty (also extended warranty for the module). I would try another dealer or push the issue with the resistant one.However, if you want to repair it yourself, you don't need a complete new headlight, the DRL LED module is sold separately and takes 5 mins to replace.Part number: 63117494851.\n\nAwesome.

I rather pay out of pocket and seems like a very easy install than deal with the inconvenience.\n\nSo…I got the LED module and installed it, same issue. The driver side DRLs were still relatively dimmer than the passenger side. Digging around, it seems the issue all along was the DRL lens that guides the light from the module was not properly installed in the module housing… Well, at least I have an extra DRL module for later on.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDigitalMioSo…I got the LED module and installed it, same issue.

Although they might look complicated from outside, it's a pretty simple MO and easy to diagnose..You can sell back the LED module, they move quickly on eBay...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDigitalMioSoI got the LED module and installed it, same issue.

If you track your car a lot, I'd say 25k miles.I'd say 50k km is when I'd do DCT fluid and filter changes, because the DCT is known to generate alot of metallic particles, so keep the intervals low to ensure the car lasts.For track is even say half that.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZM2I'm doing the fluid (replacing with Redline DCTF),I just noticed this after rereading the post, but if you use redline DCTF (very solid fluid imo, and I will be going to this fluid personally in my next transmission fluid change) I would keep intervals really really low. Because it is an ester heavy oil and esters oxidize rapidly so it is not a good fluid for long term use. So 50k km for street use or ~4 years tops maybe even less (and UOA will confirm) whatever comes first, and for the track 25k km or maybe 2 years whatever comes first (it is best to get a UOA to confirm everything is ok).But oil is cheap, dct's aren't so it is best to replace fluids regularly as preventative maintaineance.\n\nHas anyone considered just replacing like for like?\n\nI do DCT fluid and filters every year. However, I primarily track the car, so the intervals will always be shorter. I don't think it NEEDS to be done every year, but like many have stated in this thread, it's cheaper to maintain, than it is to replace!$1000 does seem a bit high though..

    "title": "Clutch Bleeding",
    "content": "Bleeding the BMW hydraulic clutch system is known to be a pain. I've recently removed my Clutch Delay Valve, and the difference in clutch action is amazing (see this thread:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1625114), but the purpose of this post is to address the topic of bleeding the system, because that's necessary if you remove the slave cylinder.BackgroundAs most of us know, the clutch hydraulic system shares the reservoir with the brakes, and is therefore topped up in the same way. The ISTA+ directions for bleeding the clutch say to use a pressure bleeder system like theMotiveorSchwaben. Many people use these positive pressure tools without filling the container, and simply keep an eye on the fluid level in the reservoir, refilling as needed.In order to save some money, I purchased the Motive European filler cap fitting only, and connected this to the small air compressor that I use for air-brushing, which also has a moisture trap and a regulator that I could easily set to 15 psi.Unfortunately, positive pressure bleeding without extra fluid in a tank doesn't work for the clutch. The other thing that doesn't work (unless you're really careful) is gravity bleeding by pumping the clutch pedal. I also tried using the Mityvac to vacuum bleed the system, but this also didn't work, for the same reason.The Root CauseThe root cause of the problem is that the brake / clutch fluid reservoir is designed so that if the clutch were to leak, the brakes wouldn't be affected, and vice versa. The brake system contains more fluid than the clutch, and is more important, so a larger reservoir is dedicated to the brake system.The problem with bleeding happens because the clutch reservoir is really small, about the size I've coloured in Blue in the diagram below; the Yellow outlet goes to the clutch master cylinder:So the reservoir volume for the clutch is tiny, and to fill it the level in the reservoir must be nearly over-flowing.If you try to bleed the clutch system by pumping the pedal, positive pressure or vacuum, before the system is full, the fluid in the reservoir will drop below the baffle, and the small volume of fluid will be drained out! If you use a pressure based system as I did, you'll totally purge the system!To make matters worse, if you don't look really carefully at the reservoir, like with a light under the back edge, you'll think it's full but the clutch section will be empty!The total amount you can push through without re-filling the reservoir to the very top above Max is only 30ml, equal to only about two pumps of the clutch pedalThe SolutionIf you're not reverse bleeding (see below), the most important thing to do is to keep topping up the reservoir. Also do not bleed to fast because even if the reservoir fluid level is high, it takes time for the fluid to flow from the brake side to the clutch side of the reservoir.My understanding is that the positive pressure bleeders from Motiv and Schwaben effectively push fluid into the reservoir, keeping it full at all times. This is why BMW recommends this approach, but youmustfill the bleed tool container.I was able to successfully bleed my clutch by opening the bleed nipple on the slave cylinder, and fully pressing and lifting (slowly) the pedal twice, then refil the reservoir, then pressing and lifting the pedal twice, then refilling etc. I think I probably did this about 30 times and it worked! Once the system was full, I did apply positive pressure to the reservoir, being very very careful to look at the reservoir level. I'm not convinced this did anything, because I also removed my BMS clutch stop at this point as well.Reverse BleedingMany people have bought into a myth about how air bubbles are constantly rising, and have resorted to reverse bleeding - pushing fluid up to the reservoir through the system. I actually tried this with three tools, but none of them worked for me and simply resulted in a mess over the garage floor:Marinating syringeTrigger action oil can15 PSI airbrush compressor through aMityvaccontainer in reverseReverse bleedingshouldwork, as long as you have enough fluid to fill the system, but it's not because of the bubbles rising issue. I was never able to get enough pressure going up through the system to get any fluid into the reservoir, but if you can overcome this, it should be a good solution.Anything Else?If you have installed a BMS clutch stop, remove it before pumping the pedal. The clutch stop may not prevent clutch disengagement, but it will prevent full bleeding! You can re-install it once the bleeding is done, but only if you bleed fully.\n\nGreat post!Thanks, and sounds like a royal PITA.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byBroDozeGreat post!Thanks, and sounds like a royal PITA.It was... initially... It took me about 6 hours to work out what was going on to be honest.As I said, I did this because I was removing the clutch delay valve, and that part of the process (removing the slave cylinder and removing the CDV from the inlet) took about 30 mins, including putting the car on the Quickjack.I started this at about 9pm, and by 10pm I had everything back together ready to bleed, and this is where I ran into problems.By 2am, having poured nearly a quart of brake fluid through the system and got some in my eye, drips over my shirt face and hair, and most over the garage floor, I gave up. By that time I'd tried (and failed) positive pressure at the reservoir (without fluid in a container), vacuum at the slave nipple, and reverse bleed using the marinade syringe.Before going to bed I ordered the Motive pressure bleeder from Amazon for same day delivery before 9pm, figuring by that point that I wouldn't be going to the office that day.In the morning, I borrowed my wife's car and picked up another litre of brake fluid and a pump oil can from Harbor Freight. I spent about 2 hours trying reverse bleed with the oil can, but eventually found that if there is any back pressure at all, the pump in the can just stops working.At this point I tried reverse bleeding by using the container from the Mityvac connected to my airbrush compressor. about 10ml went in initially, but I had to start increasing the pressure to force more fluid in. The Mityvac container is designed for vacuum though, and with pressure, the cap doesn't seal well and the best I could get was about 15psi, and this only flowed about another 10ml upwards; not nearly enough to get to the reservoir.I stopped for lunch and planned to give up again, and wait for the Motive unit to arrive. After lunch though I decided to go back and give regular pedal pump bleeding another try, paying careful attention to the level in the clutch section of the reservoir, and as you know for my OP, this worked.Now that I know all of this, I don't think it is a PITA at all, but knowing it was what made it so.My colleague has a BMW and wants to come over and do this work to his car. Now that I know the process I'm sure it will take 1 or 2 hours tops.\n\nSo, just to be clear: An Eazybleed canister attached to the bleed nipple and just pumping the clutch pedal (much like bleeding the brake solo) does the job?If so, there's a CDV or two about to be removed from the F87 and E46...\n\nOP, when you were trying to reverse bleed, did you have the bleeder screw open 3-4 turns? I found this to be necessary when I reverse bled mine. I initially tried operating the bleeder like I normally would (60ish degree swing of the wrench) and no fluid was moving. It didn't even start to drip without a turn or two.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bywellvrsdOP, when you were trying to reverse bleed, did you have the bleeder screw open 3-4 turns? I found this to be necessary when I reverse bled mine. I initially tried operating the bleeder like I normally would (60ish degree swing of the wrench) and no fluid was moving. It didn't even start to drip without a turn or two.I did, yes. I hope I didn't give the impression that reverse bleeding wouldn't work. What I hoped my post said was that reverse bleeding is a viable method if you can get it to work... but I couldn't.The other thing I wanted to get across is the reason reverse bleeding works, because I kept reading that it was to do with bubbles rising etc, which is not the reason at all.I tried reverse bleeding in 3 ways:Meat marinade syringe - leaked out the bottom of the syringe under any back pressureHarbor Freight Oil Can - Stopped pumping as soon as there was any back pressureMitevac containter (in reverse) with airbrush compressor - worked fine initially, but air leaked out of the cap once the pressure was increasedI think some people had used a large (non-leaking) syringe, and this is probably capable of more than the ~10psi that I could achieve with the Mitevac container.By the way, what approach did you use for reverse bleeding?\n\nI used this syringe:https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/...?ie=UTF8&psc=1The tubing that came with it didn't work, but I had some that did, probably 3/16 or 1/4 inch ID. I just pushed it onto the tip of the syringe until it made a seal. At first, I tried doing it with the removable tips that were included with the syringe, but I couldn't get a good seal that way. I had to push the fluid in really slowly to prevent it from blowing out the seal at the syringe or the slave cylinder. Excruciatingly slowly. The pedal wound up feeling even firmer than when I started though.I also took a brake fluid bath figuring this all out.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bywellvrsdI had to push the fluid in really slowly to prevent it from blowing out the seal at the syringe or the slave cylinder. Excruciatingly slowly.This explains a lot. A large syringe (150ml in your case) that doesn't leak, and can take a steady sustained pressure. If you had to slow down to avoid blowing off the pipe, you must have been putting quite a bit of pressure in, which explains why I wasn't able to with only 10 psi.Quote:I also took a brake fluid bath figuring this all out.It stings if you get it in your eye, and I rushed to the sink to rinse it out. Brake fluid is odd stuff though, because it feels like oil, but is really water soluble.I looked for some health and safety documentation on the bottle, but found none, and later read that it's actually not harmful so they don't need to give any guidance on the bottle.Cleaning up the garage floor is also a lot easier because you can just hose it down.\n\nSo, curious... couldn't a lot of the fluid loss (and pain from bleeding) be minimized by clamping off the flexible hose before detaching it?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeSo, curious... couldn't a lot of the fluid loss (and pain from bleeding) be minimized by clamping off the flexible hose before detaching it?I did that... The problem is that you'll still have to bleed the air in the section forward of that, and the tiny reservoir is the nightmare. Like I said, two pumps of the pedal and it's empty and you're then pushing in more air from the top.\n\nThanks for the info. I need to do this.There needs to be a YouTube video made for reverse bleeding the slave cylinder!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychmuraThanks for the info. I need to do this.There needs to be a YouTube video made for reverse bleeding the slave cylinder!There is one, but I still don't think that's the correct way to do it.I actually think there might be one way valves in the system, and you'd be pushing against them to go in reverse.In my opinion, the best way, and the way that BMW recommends, is to use a top pressure system that continuously re-fills the reservoir.The second best approach, and the one I used, is to re-fill the reservoir every two pumps of the pedal. I did the process on my own, by simply pumping twice, refilling, pumping twice refilling all with the bleed nipple open. I let about 100ml of fluid run through the system into a bottle, then tightened the nipple and all was great.\n\nThe problem with any pressurized system that refills the reservoir is that you then end up making a mess when you try to take it back off of the reservoir at the end...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeThe problem with any pressurized system that refills the reservoir is that you then end up making a mess when you try to take it back off of the reservoir at the end...That's not my experience, as long as I've let all the pressure out first before unscrewing the cap from the reservoir.You do need to take a couple of syringes worth out of the reservoir though as it will be super full afterwards.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byNezilIn my opinion, the best way, and the way that BMW recommends, is to use a top pressure system that continuously re-fills the reservoir.This mod has been on my mind and i was wondering if a top pressure bleeder would work - thanks for confirming!Luckily enough i have one in the garage! :-)I'll get this done soon!!!\n\nI'm having a hell of a time getting this done.Been using the Motive system with a full tank, but I'm still getting air bubbles at the slave. When I pop the Motive cover off the reservoir, it's full to the top. Maybe I'm going to fast and it's not filling the clutch side quickly enough. Front of the car is on jacks and rear is on the ground, but I'm thinking that would help since it looks like the clutch section of the reservoir is in the rear.Going to try to old fashion way with the pedal tonight.\n\nPut a flashlight under the reservoir so that you can see the level of the clutch section.Fill up to the very top, making sure that the clutch part does really fill.Open the bleed nipple on the slave cylinder and leave it open, but with a tube and bottle connected so that you can see that something is flowing out.Keeping an eye on the level in the clutch section by looking through the windshield as you pump.Pump the clutch once, check the level in the clutch side, see if you need to top up and do so if necessary.Pump the clutch again, continuing to check the level.Once youve pumped about 3oz through and out of the slave, and provided the level didnt drop too much, youll be done. Tighten the bleed screw and test.I believe there are one way valves in the system so you dont need to tighten the bleed screw between pumps. Just leave it open until youre done.\n\nIn a porsche, the clutch will only pressure bleed when the pedal is down - perhaps the same with these cars.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byNezilPut a flashlight under the reservoir so that you can see the level of the clutch section.Fill up to the very top, making sure that the clutch part does really fill.Open the bleed nipple on the slave cylinder and leave it open, but with a tube and bottle connected so that you can see that something is flowing out.Keeping an eye on the level in the clutch section by looking through the windshield as you pump.Pump the clutch once, check the level in the clutch side, see if you need to top up and do so if necessary.Pump the clutch again, continuing to check the level.Once you’ve pumped about 3oz through and out of the slave, and provided the level didn’t drop too much, you’ll be done.

I'm not the first to do this, and I'm sure I won't be the last...\n\nHi Nezil-Just wondering if you ever completed the job with your buddy's 235i and if you did, if you used the motive bleeder or the method that ended up working for you.I removed my CDV some months ago and reverse bled with the 150ml syringe.  I'm not convinced I don't have a bubble in there.  If I'm slamming gears at WOT, I'll occasionally feel like there's a delay--like a serious 1-2 second delay where I don't have full engagement after my foot is off the clutch.  It's only happened a few times but it scares me.  Could be something in the rear end too, not sure, but there's sometimes a feeling that something's slipping.  I may try it your way and see if it makes any difference.Anyway, just throwing it out there to see if anyone bites.Quote:Originally Posted byNezilI didn't use a pressure adapter in the end, I just kept manually re-filling the reservoir every other pump of the clutch.I did order a Motive European Power Brake Bleeder from Amazon but I needed to use the car and so worked out another way.

It will prevent full disengagement as you are using clutch pedal travel to compress the air bubble and not move the clutch towards disengagement and that can result in accelerated wear and glazing of the disk and flywheel, especially under the conditions you describe, which will in turn result in slippage.  If you suspect that is the case, you should be able to test it by getting into a tall gear 4th or 5th), low speed out of boost, and standing on it.  You should know if its slipping as it goes into boost.I did the CDV removal as well.  Used the motive.  It does require you pump the pedal, and you will see air moving from the reservoir thru the bleeder hose.  It takes a lot of pedal pumping and for a bit I was losing confidence.  But eventually the pedal started to gain pressure and the bleed was successful.",

    "title": "Ultimate Care/Ultimate Protection",
    "content": "HiFirst post, and sorry if I just didn't do a good enough job searching the forums, but bought my first BMW, got a 2021 M2Comp Manual with performance delivery picking up in Early August.  It's finally reached America, and I'm damn excited, except now the finance guys from BMW are calling asking about all of the Care/Protection/Extended warranties, etc for the car, and I'm wondering if you all have any opinions on the plans.  The extended warranties can always be purchased later, but the care/protection ones have a limited lifespan before they can get outrageous.In my opinion the protection one is heavily dependent on what you plan to do with the thing - windshields are covered by insurance, I usually get warranties from my local discount tire chain on all tires I buy, but the paintless dent repair can be a lifesaver, especially with everyone in lots being careless about your car...I have a tough time believing that rims are going to be damaged unless you really mess up the vehicle, but again, something I don't know.I have no idea whether to get the ultimate care.  They said they will cover full brake service whenever....which to me sounds really good but I have no idea how much this might occur if I casually track the car.  More importantly, I have a hard time believing they will do oil services/plugs/etc more frequently if the car is driven hard....Any opinions would be well appreciated!Thanks\n\nUltimate Care +1 can be a good buy at $2099 list - a better buy if you can talk the price down - if you drive hard enough to kill the original brakes before the 4/48 term is up. A brake job probably runs what, $2k? Boom, you've paid for the entire plan, plus you get all consumables included and an extra year. Criminal F&I dude at my dealership marked it up way over list, to $2677, while claiming that was a discounted price. I bit but canceled and got my money back.IF you don't drive hard enough to require brake replacement by then - probably not a good buy. Also not transferable to a subsequent owner if you sell, which is a big deal (or can be). Transferable only on 2022+ models per BMWUSA website.As for other 3rd party warranties - I'd avoid them all. ONLY possible exception would be tire & wheel coverage IF it's at a reasonable price and IF the roads are horrendous where you'll be driving. Then again - our 788's are forged so they should not be easy to bend/damage. Any other 3rd party coverage - VIN tracing, glass, anything - avoid it all like the plague.\n\nKevin, thank you for the detailed reply!  I really appreciate it.Honestly I have no idea how hard Im going to have to drive the thing to require a brake/clutch job, but it seems like something that will carry me into the 4/50 range may make sense if I plan to keep it that longespecially if the price is right.Appreciate it\n\nMy suggestion.. pls stay away.  Get  the best APR rate, sign the papers and walk out…My finance guy was trying to make feel that I don't care for the car… LoL. I told him I will buy all that you have for $1k if you can give me, if not save me and you some time.. let's sign as am ready to enjoy my ride. This was when I got my X5… am sure they will pull the same guilt talk when I sign my M2C.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bysilversnakeHiFirst post, and sorry if I just didn't do a good enough job searching the forums, but bought my first BMW, got a 2021 M2Comp Manual with performance delivery picking up in Early August.

I did PCD in MAY and faced the same questions as you, as it was my first BMW and M car to match.  I decided to bank on the idea that I was buying a good car with a good reputation, so I passed on the extended warranty.  I did however quote various maintenance package rates, and was considering the Ultimate Care +4, but they wanted $6100 - and was told that was cost!  Some good advice I got when I reached out to others was that the plans are not as valuable as they used to be.  BMW has dialed back the frequency of maintenance; partially because engineering and quality has continued to improve, but also because of how it is included during the first few years of ownership.  It becomes a very expensive proposition for them to switch after the initial warranty, and begin inviting cars back to the service department every few months.  Oil changes are still going to be recommended around the 10K mile mark.  I heard that some buyers negotiated some pretty low rates for their Care plans, which would make purchasing it enticing, but if you are like me and couldn't get them to budge, it didn't make economical sense.\n\nYou are going to get a lot of opinions on this, so do your research...So, here's mine:  I have a hard \"no\" policy on all dealer add-ons, protection packages, etc.  These are sold only because they turn a profit.  I'd rather put money aside and pay for things as I need them done (by businesses that I choose).Congratulations on the car and thanks for helping to save the manuals!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevinCUltimate Care +1 can be a good buy at $2099 list - a better buy if you can talk the price down - if you drive hard enough to kill the original brakes before the 4/48 term is up.

I bit but canceled and got my money back.IF you don't drive hard enough to require brake replacement by then - probably not a good buy.Like KevinC says here, if you can get a decent price on it and replace the pads once it is a decent purchase. However, the M2C comes with massive brakes that I think were pulled from the previous models ceramic calipers and had to make up the difference with quite thick pads. So, you have to do a lot of braking to wear them down.I did purchase this plan and don't remember what I paid but my plan is to track the car a few times a year in an attempt to justify the purchase since my mileage is not all that high since I have two other cars. Probably pay more in track fees to make this happen, but at least it will be fun.If you aren't going to track or if this is going to be a weekend car, you can probably skip since your mileage won't justify the cost.\n\nI purchased it at $2099. I also have zero mechanical skills, and get everything done at the dealership. I plan to auto cross it a few times a year, and I live in the mountains where spirited driving can be a little harder on the breaks. Regardless, I'll make sure I wear those pads and rotors down and get my money's worth.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bysilversnakeHiFirst post, and sorry if I just didn't do a good enough job searching the forums, but bought my first BMW, got a 2021 M2Comp Manual with performance delivery picking up in Early August.

The costs are the cost, you might negotiate them down but doubt it. Though they certainly should not be higher than MSRP.asKevinCmentioned if this is not a daily and you don't consume the brakes before the term then it may not be worth the cost. Remember this is NOT a warranty instead you are prepaying the service cost in today's dollars.\n\nYou all are awesome. Thank you for the information. If I can get a deal on it I will pursue. Otherwise I will avoid it and just resign myself to the fact that this is a weekend joy. Appreciate the feedback!\n\nDoes ultimate care plan  cover minor dents ?",

Hence, Dinan’s lack of guarantee on it.I first switched to Dinantronics Stage 1 from their Tuner back in 2017, and it worked much better. Then, upgraded to Stage 4 with turbo in 2018 and it rarely gave any CEL/limp issues on track.But, once BM3 achieved OBD unlock and I switched to a full DME flash via Bootmod3, the car gained more power and drove even better (and still does!) than even the full Dinantronics piggyback.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZM2This was Dinans response back in the day to the cheap piggyback device market that was eating some of their more complex Dinantronics piggyback lunch.Like most of these cheap devices, it causes CEL & limp mode under hard driving, and poor DCT shifts.

I ended up going back to factory tune. Im on full warranty so I didnt want to ruin it. Cars been running mint ever since.\n\nI have been using Dinan products for years.  Running the newer box on my 21 comp. Runs great. My ECU is the locked one and I dont feel like messing with it. 7 maps to pick from and easy install except for the manifold sensor. Same hardware as Racechip but with different software loads.\n\nDinan is not Dinan anymore. So take that for what it's worth.\n\nOnly 9,000 miles?!!! Keep her pristine! Congrats mate. Great purchase! Just dont go crazy on tune. Dinan is good enough. Enjoy the ride!🤙🤙",

I had a terrible time with getting my charge pipe to seat on my CSF intercooler but I think it was a result of a unlucky combination of CSF & VRSF charge pipe (I've heard others had good fitment, I did not.

I will not be responsible/held liable for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Monetary disclaimer: I do not make commission, or profits or any kind of monetary gain from the sale of the Turner Motorsport Titanium Magnetic Differential Drain Bolt.Sponsorship disclaimer: The way my reviews work is that I determine what product that I want to buy and actually use on my own car, and during this process the product that I end up choosing is what I believe is the best option on the market. I then reach out to the company offering the product and ask them if they would be willing to sponsor me in a review, if the answer is yes then I write a review, if the answer is no I would end up buying the product (sometimes at a later date) but I wouldnt complete a detailed review about it (I might write something, but not to the same extent as my standard reviews). But the critical thing is that I reach out for a sponsorship and not the other way around, this means that the products I am reviewing are actually things I believe in and would use on my own car. This also means that I am not being paid to review something I do not care about. Would I do a review if a sponsor reached out to me? The answer would depend on if I believed in the product, and I would make it clear in my review if this were the case. But at the time of writing this review, such an interaction has not occurred yet.Time of writing disclaimer: everything I am writing about in this review is described at the time of writing and may not be updated in the future, so there is a potential that things are no longer accurate in my comparisons as parts are changed and upgraded as time passes.Bias and comparison disclaimer: Throughout this review I will attempt to be as unbiased as possible while drawing comparisons to other products.Mistakes and Inaccuracies Disclaimer: Throughout my review I will try to be as factually accurate as possible, but there are always chances that I make mistakes and write things that are incorrect/false. If this is the case please point it out to me and if indeed it is true that I am incorrect, I will correct these mistakes and apologize for them. Afterall I am only human, so mistakes can and will inevitably happen.Subjective Disclaimer: Please note, these reviews are also written in my own opinion, so when I am comparing different products to determine what I see as the best, there are many factors that I go through to form this opinion. Obviously there will be disagreements between people, so I will do my best to objectively determine what I deem to be the best, but at the end of the day it is still just my own opinion whether it be right or wrong. Take whatever I say in my reviews with a grain of salt.Information Disclaimer: I read a lot of material over the years just out of sheer interest or to make these reviews. I also accumulated a lot of knowledge over my many years of education that are really relevant to cars (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics). That being said, my reviews are mostly based on this accumulated knowledge and I cannot always cite these sources due to the original source material possibly being lost to time, or there being so much knowledge compiled to make a single point. So, when possible I will cite my source(s) (for example data on tensile strength of a metal, or peer reviewed research). There are cases when I get information from blog posts, youtube videos, or forum posts I may not cite it, because I go through a lot of these sources only to use the gained knowledge in a small section of my review and it is not feasible to list them all.

Despite this I will remain as unbiased as possible during the review. Please note, the dynamics of this relationship was that I reached out for a sponsorship review and not the other way around. This should demonstrate how I truly feel about the Turner Motorsport Titanium Magnetic Differential Drain Bolt - in the sense that I truly believe it is one of the best if not the best magnetic differential drain bolt on the market. In fact I actually have 2 of these drain bolts installed on my own m2 as of now, and I really like the fitment, quality, and additional protection against wear they provide to my m2s differential.Quick intro for those of you that dont like long articles:Cheap magnetic drain plugs are typically made of brass or aluminum and commonly break leaving the body of the drain bolt inside your drain pan (in this case differential cover) resulting in a lot of struggles to extract it. Cheap magnetic drain plugs can also have incorrect thread pitches and diameters that will result in damage to your oil pan threads. These cheap magnetic drain plugs can also utilize cheap neodymium magnets that lose their magnetic abilities at temperatures lower than what your differential oil can get to during operating conditions, this means that the magnetic drain plug will let go of all the metal debris it has stuck to until it cools down meaning it is essentially useless. The Turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug addresses all of these issues and provides a magnetic drain plug that has no flaws that a cheaper plug or even a more expensive drain plug may have. Overall if you are looking for a magnetic differential drain plug this is the best magnetic drain plug available in my opinion.Now lets get into the indepth review.Why get a Magnetic Differential Drain Plug?:Lets start off with the first question - why should someone spend their hard earned money on a magnetic differential drain plug? Well the answer to that question is to protect their differential from excessive wear due to ferrous metals accumulating in the differential oil from clutch pack and gear wear and tear due to normal use.Now what do I mean by this? Well as the differential operates on these vehicles, the and the clutch packs engage and disengage they can rub and slip past each other as they actuate. This causes a small bit of wear and sheds some of the clutch pack material into the differential oil. Since clutch packs contain all sorts of materials - mainly ferrous metals as they are typically steel based with additional friction compounds added (graphite, copper etc), these materials are the things that will end up in the oil, and this is what turns your differential oil gray after it has been through a long service life. Additionally as the gears in the differential mesh past each other, they too will wear slightly and this also introduces ferrous metals into your differential oil - as differential gears are typically steel. Also note, the harder you work the differential or the more you use it, the faster these wear metals will accumulate - so if you track the car hard or drive it hard, then you will cause more wear and thus need to change the differential oil sooner.Heres a video of the F8X differential in action so you get a better idea of the inner workings of our cars diff:Now differential oil is designed to capture these wear metals and prevent it from wearing out the inner components of the differential by providing an oil film for the gears and clutch packs to glide on. However, if enough contaminants accumulate, then the differential oil wont be able to capture and isolate all these contaminants from grinding against the components in the differential. For instance if you only have a bit of metal in your differential oil and you rub your fingers in this oil you wont feel anything - this is when you do early oil change intervals for instance. But if you let the oil get very old and dirty - meaning it has accumulated a lot of metal, then you will notice this oil feels kind of gritty. This gritty feeling is what will wear down the components in your differential since the components no longer have a smooth oil film to glide over. Now, if you were somehow able to capture some of these contaminants from the oil, you would reduce the amount of particles in the oil that are capable of causing more wear and tear on the inner components of the differential. This will then lengthen the life of your differential.Thats where the magnetic drain plug comes into play, since most of these wear metals are ferrous, a magnetic drain plug will be able to capture them and prevent them from contaminating the oil, thereby taking that extra wear off the differential. An additional feature magnetic drain plugs offer is that it can give you an early warning on the health of your differential, for instance if you notice that there is significantly more ferrous metals accumulating than normal, this might be indicating an impending failure of the differential - and this gives you time to address the issue before it becomes a catastrophic failure leaving you stranded. So its another little tool to give you an insight on the health of your car, just like cutting open an oil filter will give you an insight on the health of your rod bearings.Risk of using a cheap Aluminum or Brass Drain plug:So why should you use a titanium magnetic drain plug over a brass or aluminum drain plug? There are a few reasons for this, but one reason is cheaply made plugs often found on aliexpress can have the incorrect thread pitch or bolt diameter leaving your differential cover threads stripped (now if you own an ///M vehicle you can replace the differential cover for relatively cheap - however it is a huge pain to replace, as you have to scrape off the old RTV, apply new RTV and let it cure), more on this later on. Another reason is because the weaker brass and aluminum drain plugs are susceptible to breaking at quite low torque specs and this can leave the end of the plug stuck in the differential drain plug threads resulting in a huge hassle to extract this portion of the bolt.Here are some examples of this but on an oil pan:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...84&postcount=7This m2C owner has had an aluminum magnetic drain plug snap in the oil pan long before the torque required to crush the copper washer was achieved.Credit: Diamente Post #16https://www.toyotanation.com/threads...#post-13124826Credit: Diamente Post #16https://www.toyotanation.com/threads...#post-13124826In these 2 images above you see a toyota owner with a broken magnetic drain plug from Greddy which is made from aluminum.So in summary you can see breaking cheap aluminum magnetic drain plugs are possible at very low torques - and even at torque levels so low they are insufficient to crush the washer.The benefits of titanium drain plugs over aluminum and brass drain plugs:Defining metal tensile strength and yield strength:To explain this we must go into terms such as yield strength, and tensile strength.Yield Strength:How much force it takes to induce plastic deformation and permanently deform the bolt, meaning the bolt is permanently stretched and will not spring back to its preloaded length after releasing (unscrewing) the fastener. This is an important metric because if the yield strength is too low you can end up stretching a drain bolt over and over again while torquing a plug resulting in its fatigue and eventual failure.Tensile Strength:How much force a bolt is able to resist in its axial (lengthwise) direction before failing aka snapping/breaking.Before we go into the strength comparison below we need to note that the turner motorsports titanium drain plug is made out of grade 5 Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy.Metal Tensile and Yield Strengths:Titanium Grade 5 Ti-6Al-4V Alloy: Tensile strength = ≥ 895 MPa, Yield strength = ≥ 828 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=9299Brass: Tensile strength = 360 MPa, Yield strength = 140 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6380Aluminum 6061 Alloy: Tensile Strength = 310 MPa, Yield Strength = 276 MPaCredit:https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6636So looking at this data we can see titanium (Ti-6Al-4V alloy used by turner motorsports in their differential drain plug) is nearly ~3X stronger than both the 6061 aluminum alloy and brass alloys in terms of tensile strength. The titanium is also nearly ~4x stronger than aluminum in terms of yield strength and nearly ~8X stronger than brass in terms of yield strength. So straight off the bat we are dealing with a significantly stronger metal meaning it will take much higher torques to break a drain plug made of this material, and you are more likely to strip the threads out of your aluminum differential cover before breaking the plug in terms of maximum torque you can apply. This is great because the common reports of failure was that cheaper plugs broke before the prescribed torque specs were reached, so making these plugs out of titanium will prevent that from ever happening, and prevent fatigue induced failures. This is even more important because magnetic drain plugs are hollow inside for magnet placement, so they are already weaker than solid bolts so a strong metal is really vital to avoid breaks.Quickly looking at the cheaper plugs we can speculate that they fail due to the following reasons:1) The problem normally occurs because of the fact that a lot of people working on these cars do not use torque wrenches or poorly calibrated torque wrenches. You commonly hear owners saying it is tight when it is tight '', wrist tight, one ugga dugga etc. When gauging how much torque or how tight they should have their drain bolts. Well this is a problem especially on cheaper magnetic drain plugs because they are made of aluminum or brass which has a really low tensile strength which you can easily exceed if you are not being careful and thus end up breaking the bolt.2) Reuse of old O-rings on the differential drain plugs - and yes these BMW F8X E-diffs have single use O-rings on the drain and fill plugs, after these plugs are torqued to spec the O-rings is permanently deformed as it is squished down to make a fluid tight seal. If you try to reuse these O-rings they will often leak as they cant be squished down to seal the gaps anymore - since they are already flattened. So if you end up trying to reuse them at the bmw prescribed torque spec they will likely leak and if you try to stop the leak with more torque to crush it down more than you will either strip your diff cover or break your bolt.3) Even if the tensile strength limit of a bolt is not exceeded one can still reach the yield point of the bolt which can cause permanent plastic deformation of the bolt forever weakening it due to fatigue (this is why you should never reuse torque to yield bolts). Over time if this is done a lot your bolt will snap/shear.4) The bolt gets a bit seized due to road debris - which can be possible since the differential is out in the open and exposed to all sorts of road debris, and the force it takes to break the bolt free is higher than the tensile strength of the bolt, this can cause the bolt to break.5) Metal impurities weakening the metalOverall I have seen a lot of horror stories of aluminum and brass drain bolts snapping inside of the oil sump, and this is what stopped me from buying a magnetic drain plug until finally Turner motorsports solved this issue by releasing a magnetic drain plug made out of titanium. This stronger metal that the turner motorsports drain plug is constructed out of should prevent any breaking issues regardless if you over tighten it (you are more likely to strip out your differential cover threads so please use a properly calibrated torque wrench), the bolt gets seized from road debris, and even if there were small impurities in the metal the overall strength of titanium should be high enough to compensate and prevent failure.Turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug:Quick overview - with pictures:So lets begin our overview of this magnetic drain plug!Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSpecs:Now lets discuss some of the specs of this titanium magnetic differential drain plug.i) Thread pitch:  The thread pitch of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain plug is M22 X 1.5, so the pitch is 1.5 mm. Comparing this to the stock plug that has been used pretty much on all BMW for the last couple of decades, the stock plug is M22 X 1.5 as well(https://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/par...&q=33117525064).Here are some images of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug with its thread pitch measured, and being meshed together to ensure there are no thread pitch anomalies. Note that metric bolts have a 60 degree thread angle so my thread pitch tool will also verify this angle if it fits snugly.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceAs you can see by these images the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plugs thread pitch is exactly the 1.5 mm as required by the bmw differential cover, and is perfectly meshed with the stock plug and thread pitch gauge. This means that the thread pitch of this drain bolt is perfect and will not cause any issues. The only difference is that the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug is 16.11mm long vs 8.62 mm of the stock plug. The length discrepancy however is not an issue due to the fact that there is nothing that close to the plug even if it is a bit longer (this is on an F8X).ii) Diameter: Next we will examine the diameter bolt of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug compared to the stock one with digital calipers, and with a swiping technique to get the maximum diameter (major diameter) of a cylindrical object.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceAs you can see by these images the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain bolt has a major diameter of 21.91 mm and the stock differential drain bolt has a major diameter of 21.75 mm.iii) Hex size: The turner motorsports titanium differential drain plug also features a 14.17 mm internal hex which is 0.03 mm larger than the factory drain plug. Here is an image of the hex being measured with digital calipers.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceAs you can see the hex is 14.17 mm so it will fit very well with male hex bits (which are actually slightly bigger than 14.00 mm by a small amount - mine was 14.06 mm) and with nearly no play. This means that the female hex will not suffer from damage by being slightly too large (the female hex will not be rounded as you apply torque to it) and it means there will be very little play when the male hex is inserted.iv) Magnetic  grade strength and surface area: Not many people think about the magnet type itself when purchasing a magnetic drain plug, but I am here to tell you that not all magnets are the same for the reasons below.The turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug utilizes a neodymium grade n42 type SH magnet (https://www.albmagnets.com/neodymium...ts-grades.html) which retains its magnetic efficacy up to 150℃, however when talking to an engineer from Turner motorsports he informed me in their testing efficacy of the magnet was not lost until 204℃. These numbers are incredibly good especially since the rear axle oil should never get to these temperatures, as it would be extremely close to the 228℃ flash point of Castrol Syntrax Limited Slip 75W-140 (a compatible LSD oil for these BMW M E diffs: https://msdspds.castrol.com/ussds/amersdsf.nsf/Files/06260218E9A0DF3A802580BB00581A06/$File/11197349.pdf), and oils are never run this hot nor this close to flash point temperatures anyways.The strength of this magnet is also really impressive, it can hold a large wrench and still provide a decent bit of retention even when I pull against it with the help of gravity. So that is really nice, and note even if those cheaper magnetic drain plugs can hold alot of weight if the magnet grade is not designed for high temps then all that strength is for nothing.But speaking in terms of a numbers side of things neodymium grade n42 magnets have a Br rating (it is the magnetic property that is independent of magnet shape and is the magnetic induction remaining after a magnetic field has been removed from a magnetic material it is trying to induce a magnetic field in) of 13,200 Gauss (https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog.asp...20the%20magnet.) while offering the highest operating temperature possible. So essentially it is a really strong magnet even compared to the competition which offers neodymium magnets in the low 4 digit gauss ratings.Finally I must mention surface area. This magnetic differential drain plug has some of the best magnet surface area out there, because not only is the tip of the magnet exposed but the magnet also protrudes out giving it more surface area than a lot of competitors - thereby allowing it to pick up more material.Images of the drain plug fully installed:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo here are my installed images of the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug on my bmw m2. Overall fitment is excellent, there are no leaks, and I have no overall complaints! Everything fits and performs as it should!Addressing some concerns:While doing research for this review I have stumbled upon a couple of concerns and a bunch of misinformation regarding issues with magnetic drain plugs and I would like to address them.1) Stripping threads: I have heard so much about how after market plugs can strip the oil drain pan plugs, but this generally is not the case. If the aftermarket drain plug has the same thread pitch, and plug diameter as the stock drain plug stripping can only be due to these reasons I have listed below (note aluminum differential covers already have weaker threads than steel differential covers):a) The threads in the differential cover are not cleaned out during oil changes and residual oil acts like a torque multiplier and you end up putting more torque on the drain plug than what was required resulting in fatiguing of the threads. Having multiple repetitive cycles of over tightening will cause the drain pan threads to fail over time.b) Reuse of the old O-ring, again you have to over tighten the drain plug as a result to compensate for any leaks due to the O-ring already being flattened and not being able to seal as well, resulting in stripped threads.c) Not using a torque wrench and using the bmw prescribed torque specs and thus over tightening the bolt (this is the big one).d) Cross threading the drain plug because it was not put in by hand first.e) Use of impact tools or any power tools on the drain bolt.2) Drain plug diameter: Before we can discuss this I must include an image demonstrating diameters.Credit: Site admin from all America thread products, August 28, 2015.https://330zpr17apfr1j45wba4i5dj-wpe...-1-768x327.jpgFrom this image you can see there are a couple of different parameters that a bolt may have:a) major diameter: the outermost diameter and the one that classifies what type of bolt it is eg m12 or m8 etc. (I measured the turner motorsports titanium magnetic drain bolts major diameter above).b) minor diameter the innermost diameter the pitch diameter the midpoint between the major and minor diameterc) the thread angle this is another factor that determines if a bolt is metric or inch based, for eg. metric bolts have 60 degrees of thread angle (my thread pitch tool was 60 degrees so it also measured thread angle as a result of measuring thread pitch).d) pitch which determines the spacing between the threads (as we have measured earlier).So I have also heard chatter about how aftermarket drain plug major diameters are smaller than stock or smaller than the required 22.00 mm of an m22 drain bolt causing the drain plug to strip. Again this is complete nonsense, every bolt even the factory one (as measured above) can vary from the perfect 22.00 mm spec (actually no bolt should be exactly 22.00 mm in terms of major diameter otherwise it might get cause too much galling due to it being way too tight, or seize up from being too tight, and thermal expansion differences can be problematic as well) of an m22 bolt due to manufacturing tolerances. So as long as the bolt is within the tolerance range for an m22 bolt which is generally around 21,623 mm - 21,958 mm (as per this source:https://fullerfasteners.com/tech/thr...rews-and-nuts/). Every source is slightly different in the hundredths or thousandths of a mm range so nothing too major as the general range is the same. Also note if your bolt has a thread that is a bit more round instead of sharp this can impact major diameter measurements as well adding to the mostly benign variation that we see bolt to bolt, so again this shows how major diameter can fluctuate a lot so you should not panic if your bolt is not exactly 22.00 mm or slightly smaller than stock. When we look at the measurements I took above my turner motorsports magnetic drain plug is at 21.91 mm so it falls within this acceptable tolerance range as well so no issues with this plug. My stock drain bolt is 21.75 mm, so even smaller than the Turner bolt, but again in the acceptable tolerance range. Right away this debunks the myth that smaller bolts cause issues. It is simply not true and likely the reason for stripped threads was the mechanic did not torque to spec properly, or did not clean the threads of oil which acts like a torque multiplier.What is more important is the pitch diameter which determines how much surface area of the thread makes contact with the oil pan threads, and this is verified via measuring minor diameter and major diameter and determining the average. Unfortunately the blades of my calipers were to thick to obtain the minor diameter of the drain bolt so I could not calculate pitch diameter. However I did perform a wobble test on both the stock and TMS drain plug. What the wobble test is - is that you thread in the bolt down the same number of threads and wobble it to see if it moves. If the bolt doesnt move it is extremely tight in the hole and this could mean the minor or major diameter was too large and is touching the drain pan threads too much preventing any wobble. Since we know that the major diameter is acceptable for both bolts the minor diameter is what we would be testing. The stock bolt did have some wobble and from what I determined so did the TMS bolt to the same degree. This obviously isnt super scientific but it did verify that nothing was out of spec to the point where there was alot of additional friction on the oil drain pan threads to where it would cause galling and potential stripping.I also did mesh the two drain plugs together as seen in the images above and you do not see any gaps meaning thread pitch was good (also verified by my thread pitch gauge).So in general if the major diameter is different than the M22 spec do not panic so long as the major diameter and all of the other diameters are within the acceptable range it is perfectly fine, remember when machining occurs there will always be minor error nothing is perfect when mass produced hence why a tolerance range exists. So dont panic if you see posts of individuals saying a smaller bolt is bad and will strip your threads (most likely their pan threads were either already fatigued, or it was over torqued, or cross threaded, or maybe their bolt happened to be defective who knows), the engineering side of things says otherwise so long as your bolt is in the acceptable tolerance range you will be fine.3) Thread pitch: This has also been a concern for alot of people. But with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug the thread pitch is the correct 1.5 mm as verified with my thread pitch gauge as you could see in the images above. So you will not run into any issues with thread pitch when using the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug.4) Magnets coming loose: Ok this is only a concern with cheap magnetic plugs that rely on adhesives to hold the magnet in, because when the oil gets hot the adhesives fail and the magnet can come loose. Some cheaper plugs may use really weak adhesive and rely on the magnet to also stick to the metal plug, but the combination of poor adhesives that fail in high temperature situations and cheap magnets that loose their magnetic properties (as discussed earlier) at low temperatures will also cause the magnet to come loose. But honestly despite alot of research I did not see this issue too frequently.Now with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug it is fit into the body of the plug using an interference press fit technique. This means that the hole is smaller than the size of the magnet so the retention of the magnet is unparalleled compared to any adhesives and will not weaken over time, and you should never have a magnet fall out unless you crack it or damage the plug body. Now turner motorsports have also informed me that they performed alot of thermal simulations so that the different expansion rates of the different metals (the neodymium magnet and titanium plug) will not be able to cause the magnet to come loose even at temperatures higher than what the engine will see. Another benefit of titanium for interference press fits is that the metal is extremely durable and strong, so you wont have to worry about titanium fatiguing over time due to use and possibly stretching or deforming to the point where the magnet may slip out. So overall the magnet coming loose on this drain plug is a nonexistent issue.5) Female Internal Hex head rounding off: This is a really rare issue but I have heard complaints of this online. This issue is mainly due to the female hex on magnetic drain bolts being alot larger and shallower than the hex bit that youre supposed to use which creates alot of play, or the user using an imperial socket instead of a metric one. This combined with a soft metal like aluminum can eventually result in the female hex being rounded off. But this is a non-issue with the turner motorsports titanium magnetic differential drain plug which has a hex size of 14.17 mm shown by my caliper measurements above. The depth of the hex is also sufficient enough that when used with a 14 mm hex bit, and there is no play either. Combine this with the fact that the plug is made of very durable titanium means there is no chance that you will round the hex on this plug, youre more likely to strip the threads on the drain pan before damaging this hex.6) Galvanic Corrosion: I hear this alot, since titanium and aluminum are very dissimilar metals wont galvanic corrosion be a concern? The answer is technically no, this is because galvanic corrosion only occurs if there is the presence of an electrolyte (for cars this is most commonly salt water from road salt being used in the winter) between the aluminum and the titanium. This means the internal threads are safe, since the O-ring and the way the head of the bolt seals against the differential cover prevents any electrolytes from getting into the threads. Now what about the bolts head and the differential cover? Well technically the differential cover remains very hot so any salty water that splashes onto it will get evaporated or dried off extremely quickly so that shouldnt be an issue. The only time this would be a problem is if you literally parked your car for a prolonged period of time with the differential submerged in salty water.So naturally speaking, I doubt galvanic corrosion would pose any issues in this application - the aluminum would suffer far more damage due to pitting induced corrosion from the road salt vs. damage from galvanic corrosion.One more thing: Dont forget, the 2 piece floating rotors on these cars (directly from BMW) have the iron friction rings attached to the aluminum hat via stainless steel pins. This is another dissimilar metal combination when speaking about aluminum and stainless steel - and yet you dont see people cry and whine about galvanic corrosion on an even more critical part compared to the differential cover. This is likely because the brakes get way too hot for any electrolytes (salt water) to remain there for a prolonged period to cause issues, plus the rotors are perpendicular to the ground making it very hard for water to pool on them. So unless you park your car with the rotors submerged in salty water, there shouldnt be an issue - just like the differential.Heres an image of SHW (this is supposed to be the OE for BMW M and M performance brake rotors) talking about the pin drive system used on the F8X rotorsCredit: SHW Performancehttps://www.shwperformance.com/our-productsReplacement O-rings:In conjunction with purchasing this magnetic drain plug, I recommend picking up a few replacement O-rings while you are at it - this way when you do differential oil changes in the future you wont need to purchase them again. You also save on shipping costs when you bundle them together. Heres a link incase you are interested:https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-6...br-020-o-ring/Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceI would also like to talk about these O-rings vs. the ones that come standard on the TMS differential drain plug. These replacement O-rings are black, and made of HNBR (Hydrogenated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber) and this is an even more resistant form of nitrile rubber that has all of its olefinic groups removed via the hydrogenation process (this makes it resistant to ozone degradation). The O-rings that come standard on the stock differential drain plug and the TMS drain plug are green and likely Viton. Now I know some people may be concerned that HNBR is inferior to viton and shouldnt be used as the O-ring material of choice - but this is false. HNBR is extremely chemical resistant and suitable for use with oil, and has a very wide operating temperature range that spans deep into the -30C range to 150C (https://o-ring.info/en/materials/hnb...0%2B302%C2%B0F). So HNBR is absolutely a viable replacement for Viton for use as the O-ring in our differentials.Side note: the gloves I use in the lab are nitrile gloves, and these gloves protect my hands from a wide variety of strong acids and very strong solvents without fail. Most standard lab gloves are also nitrile as well, and we rarely require the use of anything more durable - so rest assured HNBR (a more chemical resistant form of nitrile) is more than suitable for the job.Fill Plug:Lastly I would like to talk about the differential fill-plug, on these F8x BMWs (non M models only have one plug that is used for draining and filling) we have a drain and a fill port, and both of these plugs are one time use due to their O-rings. The fill plug and drain plug are also the exact same part number, and are interchangeable as a result. So I personally recommend that you replace both the fill and drain plug with the Turner Motorsport Titanium Magnetic Differential Drain Plug, this way you get the additional protection of having 2 magnets capture ferrous particles (of course the fill plug will only be able to capture particles with the diff oil splashes over it during driving) vs. just 1, and you will have 2 drain plugs that no longer need to be replaced (all you have to do is replace the O-rings). This is actually what I have done on my own car, as you have seen above in the installed images, and I think this is the way to go. Note: you should check the diff for clearance before installing the magnetic drain plug on the fill port, for me I have more than enough clearance so it isnt a big deal for me to run dual magnetic drain plugs.Overall summary:Overall in my opinion this is the best magnetic differential drain plug currently available due to its titanium construction which should prevent any breaking issues from ever occurring. It also features the correct thread pitch and diameter as previously described so no thread stripping of your differential cover should ever occur. The magnet itself is also the correct type to withstand higher oil temperatures that your differential may ever experience without losing magnet efficacy meaning this magnet will always work and be able to stick to any metal particles in your differential. So all of these features literally make it the best magnetic differential drain plug available imo, there literally is nothing else that I could find that I would say even comes close to this plug. It also is a really nice cheap mod every bmw owner should get because it can also help protect your differential from experiencing any additional wear and tear from metal debris.So if you are interested in purchasing the drain plug and replacement O-rings here are some links:Drain Plug (I recommend purchasing 2 to replace both the fill and drain plugs):https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-5...x-socket-head/O-rings (I recommend buying a few pairs so you will always have some on hand for future differential oil changes, plus this means you wont have to pay for shipping O-rings alone in the future):https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-6...br-020-o-ring/\n\nReserved for Future Posts.\n\nI'll be getting one when it's time for my diff fluid change.  Thanks for all the great info!\n\nThat is a very nice looking piece.  And as usual,F87sourcehas done a thorough review.But, at 10x the price of the OEM plug, I'm having a hard time justifying buying one of those.  Sure, you can reuse it with a cheap(ish) o-ring, but it would probably take a 100 years to break even.And yes, the magnet makes it easy to find metal particles.  But for that price I think I'll just watch for pretty glitter in my drained diff fluid.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byggggbmwThat is a very nice looking piece.

This is far more useful for the average consumer.Sorry but I feel like everything you wrote it pointless if theres no actual real world results shown.No it's based on previously established knowledge and logic. We all know as differential packs wear they generate small particles, these particles contribute to wear hence why we have to change oil regularly. If you capture some of that contamination you obviously will reduce wear, less particles rubbing by means lower wear and tear. It's like rubbing your hands with a lot of sand vs only a bit, the high sand count will cause more rubbing and will scuff your hands up more.Btw you do realize in science we often use pre established facts where we can right? We don't redefine conventions for every single experiment. By your logic we shouldnt change oil ever because there's no proof on our differentials specifically that oil changes reduce wear and tear. We also should change coolant and transmission oil either...\n\nId love to see 3-4 differential oil analysis results with and without the plug. What Im saying is you first know the materials need to be ferrous to even be caught, and the film strength of the fluid changed at regular intervals may prove perfectly fine enough.A lot of expense for minimal to no benefit. I speculate why magnets are occasionally used in transmission pans but essentially nowhere else.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byps2choId love to see 3-4 differential oil analysis results with and without the plug.

I speculate why magnets are occasionally used in transmission pans but essentially nowhere else.There are plenty of ferrous materials in the diff - clutch packs have iron in them, the gears are forged steel, the ball bearings are steel etc. Even these aluminum BMW engines produce ferrous metal that can be caught with magnetic drain plugs - and that's because despite the blocks being aluminum, there are plenty of iron components...",

    "title": "BMW Roadside / AAA",
    "content": "Does anyone here ever use BMW roadside assistance? Just got my M2C and trying to decide if I should just sign up for AAA. Im worried about the fact that there is no spare tire and I dont have run flats. Ive never used BMW Roadside and Im curious if its free or has any downsides. I think they will only tow to local dealerships and probably their timeliness of service isnt as good.Thoughts.\n\nNo worry.  BMW roadside is as good as AAA.  It is free for as long as your warranty.  If you need a tow they will tow it to the nearest BMW dealer.\n\nAll the roadside/AAA type services draw from the same database.  Whoever is available and agrees to price terms they go with or whoever is available to do the job with the correct tow/flatbed.\n\nI have AAA mainly for the other car and discounts,  it really paid off when I had to rent a car for my son and hertz waived the young driver fees because of AAA discount\n\nI have always had AAA Plus because I want towing up to 100 miles (which might be my house rather than the nearest BMW dealer).  I also had AAA flatbed my previous BMW to a independent 45 miles away (rather than a BMW dealer 15 miles away) when the water pump failed.The cheapest AAA Basic plan forces you to go to the nearest AAA garage (or IIRC, 5 miles or some small distance)The most expensive plan includes a 200 mile tow.  I prefer to have control over the destination.\n\nin addition to your BMW roadside assistance, lots of insurance companies also offer the service. your current insurance provider may already have you covered. the only bad thing with AAA is trying to cancel it. i had to let AMEX handle the issue since AAA was being a royal pain with cancellation.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by2PUTTthe only bad thing with AAA is trying to cancel it. i had to let AMEX handle the issue since AAA was being a royal pain with cancellation.Strange, that hasn't been my experience at all. They email/mail me a letter each year asking me to renew and If I don't pay it cancels itself. Maybe you enrolled in some sort of auto-renewal/autopay?Speaking of royal pains, try cancelling a Sirius XM subscription. Wonderful company to deal with\n\nAdvice from someone with experience in the auto insurance claims industry and towing. Often, AAA owns or contracts with towers at higher pay rate than insurers or BMW. Time of day, location and weather are all important factors. I found myself with a flat a short time ago and was on the side of the road for 3 hours waiting on BMW arranged tow. When they arrived, they couldn't tow because my car was too low. Crazy, right? BMW knows what they are towing in advance. Called AAA and they were out 40 minutes later with the right equipment.I find AAA pays for itself with discounts or offsets enough at least. I would recommend them over insurance or BMW.\n\nTook over 3 hours for BMW roadside to rescue me. In NYC where tow trucks are everywhere. And their number didnt work for first hour trying to reach them.Job well done\n\n1 Tow out of pocket expense will pay for an annual AAA membership. At least the classic anyway. Most times it'll cover most of or all of Plus membership depending on how far you want to Tow. Another good thing about AAA is that they'll tow any car even if you don't own it as long as you are there when they arrive. So if you're in your friends car it breaks down and need a Tow. They'll tow it. And unlike BMW they will tow to any location\n\ni have AAA Premier in case I breakdown at a track (200 mile tow). I've had a battery replaced for free as well with the coverage, $250 AGM battery installed. I have an AirMan ResQ Pro+ in my trunk just in case I dont have time to wait for AAA (catching a flight).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byStoophyI noticed this thread is a bit older, but the topic of roadside assistance remains relevant. It's great to see that you were thinking ahead when deciding between BMW Roadside Assistance and AAA for your M2C.BMW Roadside Assistance often comes with the purchase of a BMW, catering to BMW owners' unique needs. AAA, on the other hand, provides more general coverage for various vehicles.Additionally, services likestuck.solutionshave also been offering reliable roadside assistance solutions, ensuring you have assistance whenever you need it. Ultimately, the choice between these services comes down to your preferences and the level of coverage you desire for your vehicle.Wouldnt say bmw roadside is any better than anything else. Second time calling roadside after the chargepipe wasnt secured after my warranty service. Yeah my first problem was due to dealer mechanic work. They sent a an old school taildragger tow truck couldnt wait any longer but bmw called back stating no bmw m car should be towed on a taildragger unless absolutely necessary. They last guy didnt know what he was doing. He was nice and paid for my Uber to pick up my car.\n\nMy wife shredded a tire north of Nashville, TN. (The potholes on I-65 are something else!) She called the BMW roadside assistance number. The automated service wouldn't recognize her VIN. So she did it via the SOS button. BMW roadside said someone would be there in 90 minutes. After 90 minutes my wife called back and was told it would be another hour. After that time elapsed she called AAA and was towed in less than 30 minutes. While in the tow truck BMW called and said it would be at least another 30 minutes.So, BMW roadside assistance wanted a female to wait by the side of the road for 4 hours. Absolutely terrible customer service. As our family only owns BMWs we are certainly rethinking our next auto purchase.",

About 5 months ago i had a notification stating (turn indicator rear right failure) where the indicators would flash rapidly when activated. Took it into dealership. The fault didn't repeat for them of course and the fault code hadn't stored, so i was sent on my merry way. A couple of months down the line it happened again. I made sure to take pictures/video this time. Also had an ABS failure, rear diff failure and stability control failure. Fortunately this was just from a faulty front ABS/wheel sensor which got replaced under warranty. This time they replaced the whole right rear cluster and the problem was resolved. Anyway, the left one has failed now. Fun stuff. Have any other people had one or both rear indicator units fail? Guess it doesn't help the stereotype.\n\nMine has happened once ever where I went to signal to turn right and it blinked rapidly, but then I switched the turn signal off and then went to signal again and it went back to normal. Has not reoccurred since.Oh I forgot, mine was affected by the tail light recall as well. My rear right taillight housing was cracked, so they replaced it.

Guess the permanent DIY fix is the only way forward then as it'll eventually become an out of warranty issue. Disappointing that they haven revised the part if that's the case. Mine was an early production M2C. Has a revised light cluster/ wiring loom not been released? I think I'll still book it in to get the left done then retro the fix onto that if needed.

Should this be a warranty replacement of the headlamps, or can this be corrected?\n\nThe fogging is normal, but it should be temporary. The headlights and tail lights have breather holes in them to dissipate any condensation. Are you parking your car outdoors in the rain? That could explain why it hasn't gone away on its own. I'm sure humidity and temperature play a part as well.\n\nI had condensation in both taillights, they were replaced under warranty. 2017\n\nThe car has is kept in a garage and it hasn’t been driven in any rain yet. I may give it a few more days and then contact the dealer to see about a warranty replacement. It has been extremely cold where I live as well.\n\nI dont think that's normal at all.

No amount of airing by removing the big black caps on top of the headlight to using a hair dryer worked. I even lowered silica gel pouches into the area.But I do have a solution and so far 3 months in works 100%.Find a friendly body shop who has experience of removing the headlamp. It's tricky and you can break clips easily. I used my local official BMW dealer. They charged me £100 + 20% VAT.The guy was an ace and in 45 mins had the lamp out and handed to me. He checked for obvious signs but none. Sometimes if the headlamp gets knocked (whilst you are away) the mounting brackets break and let in water. Mine were intact. The car has to stay as they will drop the front bumper. I had a loan car and put the headlamp on the front seat, glass facing roof lining, glad there was a newspaper on the seat as I did not want to soil the free loan car. Very damp news paper after 30 mins. So it had residue water.Put oven at 50C on fan, place headlamp to dry for 60/90 mins. Do get your partners permission first. Now comes the fix. Got my plumber buddy to help. Buy good quality clear bathroom silicone. But first looking at the headlamp as fitted to the car, gently remove the black trim on top of lamp. Be gentle and it does come off. underneath this is the culprit. Mine was quite damp and dirty at the join. Clean and dry with tissue.Turn it over and underneath is another black plastic trim. remove and clean underneath.Now we checked all the joins and planned the next step. go over all joins with a thin layer of silicone, spray with water and then gently work into the the join of the clear plastic and the headlamp body. There are some minor ones so be thorough. then put a bit of silicone on the 2 black trims removed and stick them back.Return to oven for 60 mins. don't be tempted to go above 50C, in case you want to do a pizza whilst you wait.Took the lamp back to BMW dealer who was on standby and he fitted it in 75 minutes. and aligned the lamps too.so far it works even with a pressure cleaner.excuse the long story but wanted to answer all your questions.\n\nPage 187 of the drivers manual:\n\nWeek old car, hand washed a few times with a low power pressure washer 2300 psi AND not to closeIt's been \"Noah\" rains here in New England so I'm not to worriedCar parked outsideUpdate: since 8am-1pm hood lifter to air out and car in mostly direct sun, 70% betterUpdate 2: now late in the afternoon the headlight got more foggyDrivers side headlight no issue?Final update 05-28 after speaking to the dealer I scheduled breakin service AND headlight, took 10 days but I wanted a loaner, they replaced the headlight $2600 bill otherwise  and did the oil service ($0 out of pocket cost to me)They sent the damaged unit back to Bmw?No headaches with trying to get a replacement, all was smooth dealing with the service dept.\n\nI'd be tempted to take that to the dealer, I've never had any condensation like that on my 2017.

Car is 1 and a half year old, 13,500 miles.1. Driver sun visor fell out. That was resolved quickly and painlessly.2. Biggest headache of all. Dashboard rattle that they couldn't seem to figure out what it was. They have taken the dashboard, A pillar, and driver side door out multiple times over to finally I think find it. They've felt taped what seems to be everything, replaced AC vents, door handle, etc. This was said to be fixed a couple times, just for me to bring the car back again and again.3. One of those times I am leaving the dealership after the rattle has been \"fixed\" and a technician or someone accidentally tore a 2\" gash into my steering wheel. Oh well, guess I gotta come back and have them replace that. They did after it took a few days to arrive. No biggie.4. And just this time after the 2 week period of having the car with them, I think the dashboard rattle is resolved, and the clutch pedal was replaced. I think I'm good. I'm happy. Oh, what's that? Another gash in the steering wheel! Are you serious? LOL5.

    "title": "BMS Billet BMW Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool Review",
    "content": "Credit: F87SourceIntroduction:In this product review I will be taking a look at the BMS Billet BMW Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool, and going over why this tool in my opinion is the best one on the market, and I have bought and tested A LOT of different variations of these tools in my time owning an F series BMW.So if you’re interested in buying this tool, here’s a link:https://burgertuning.com/collections...p-removal-toolDisclaimer:Damage/Injury Disclaimer: Any information, guidance, technical advice, coding advice, tuning advice, datalogging advice, installation instruction, calculation, experiment, safety information, or product installation demonstrated in my reviews is to be consumed and or done at your own risk. I will not be responsible for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Monetary disclaimer: I do not make commission, or profits or any kind of monetary gain from the sale of the BMS Billet BMW Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool.Sponsorship disclaimer: The way my reviews work is that I determine what product that I want to buy and actually use on my own car, and during this process the product that I end up choosing is what I believe is the best option on the market. I then reach out to the company offering the product and ask them if they would be willing to sponsor me in a review, if the answer is yes then I write a review, if the answer is no I would end up buying the product (sometimes at a later date) but I wouldn’t complete a detailed review about it (I might write something, but not to the same extent as my standard reviews). But the critical thing is that I reach out for a sponsorship and not the other way around, this means that the products I am reviewing are actually things I believe in and would use on my own car. This also means that I am not being paid to review something I do not care about. Would I do a review if a sponsor reached out to me? The answer would depend on if I believed in the product, and I would make it clear in my review if this were the case. But at the time of writing this review, such an interaction has not occurred yet.Time of writing disclaimer: everything I am writing about in this review is described at the time of writing and may not be updated in the future, so there is a potential that things are no longer accurate in my comparisons as parts are changed and upgraded as time passes.Bias and comparison disclaimer: Throughout this review I will attempt to be as unbiased as possible while drawing comparisons to other products.Mistakes and Inaccuracies Disclaimer: Throughout my review I will try to be as factually accurate as possible, but there are always chances that I make mistakes and write things that are incorrect/false. If this is the case please point it out to me and if indeed it is true that I am incorrect, I will correct these mistakes and apologize for them. Afterall I am only human, so mistakes can and will inevitably happen.Subjective Disclaimer: Please note, these reviews are also written in my own opinion, so when I am comparing different products to determine what I see as the best, there are many factors that I go through to form this opinion. Obviously there will be disagreements between people, so I will do my best to objectively determine what I deem to be the best, but at the end of the day it is still just my own opinion whether it be right or wrong. Take whatever I say in my reviews with a grain of salt.Image Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the respective image owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.Review Disclaimer:First and foremost I would like to thank Burger Motorsports (BMS) for agreeing to partially sponsor me for this review. Despite this I will remain as unbiased as possible during the review. Please note, the dynamics of this relationship was that I reached out for a sponsorship review and not the other way around. This should demonstrate how I truly feel about the BMS Billet BMW Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool - in the sense that I truly believe it is the best oil filter removal tool on the market, and an absolute necessity for any BMW owner who performs oil changes themselves.Customer Service, Shipping, and Overall Experience Dealing with BMS:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceLet’s begin with customer service, shipping, and the overall experience. I have said this in the past and I will say it again, BMS has some of the best customer service in the entire BMW community. They are responsive when answering emails, and are friendly, patient, and polite (Thanks again Payam). Shipping was great, BMS uses FedEx International Connect Plus which allowed for economical and fast shipping even across international borders (USA to Canada). BMS also uses quality ULine boxes (not some cheap Chinese boxes) with proper Box certificates and they package the box incredibly nicely with plenty of brown paper stuffing. Now you may wonder why is this even important? Well to answer that question it has everything to do with shipping insurance. If your package is ever damaged FedEx or UPS or any other carrier will ask for photo evidence of the packaging to make sure it was sufficiently packed and protected. They will then ask for the box certificate number to ensure that the box was strong enough for the items packed within. If any of these are not within spec, then your insurance claim may be denied. This is why packaging is so important, and BMS has perfectly nailed this criteria.So overall, customer service, shipping, and my experience dealing with BMS has been great, no real complaints!What is a Billet Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool, and why is is needed on BMW cars?:Let’s begin by discussing what a Billet Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool is.Billet - in this case Billet Aluminum refers to the process of taking a solid block of Aluminium and machining it to a desired shape - in this case an Oil Filter Cap Removal tool.An Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool is a cup like tool used to grip the BMW oil filter cap and allow a ratchet to attach to it so the cap can be turned counterclockwise and removed, or turned clockwise and tightened down and eventually torqued to spec.So why is this tool even needed? Well the answer to that question is because like most oil filters, the BMW oil filter cap is an odd shape with nothing to attach a socket to, so we need a tool that fits the top of the cap and can have a ratchet attach to it. Here’s an image of the BMW oil filter cap found on most if not all N5x engines and the S55 engine:Credit: F87SourceOr if you had an aftermarket Aluminum oil filter cap that still required a removal tool like this:Credit: Malo Industrieshttps://www.maloindustries.com/produ...51-n52-n20-n26This also means even if you were able to remove the cap with a rubber strap wrench like this:Credit: Amazonhttps://www.amazon.ca/Craftsman-Rubb.../dp/B00K92810AYou will not be able to torque it to spec if you cannot connect a torque wrench to it. So regardless if you were able to get the oil filter cap off, you will need a tool like this BMW Oil Filter Cap Removal tool in order to correctly torque the oil cap back on and prevent oil leaks or damaging your cap due to over tightening it.BMW Oil Filter Cap Measurements:Before we begin looking at the BMS Billet Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool, let’s analyze the stock BMW oil cap.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo the stock BMW oil filter cap is a plastic lid with a diameter of approximately 86.34 mm, and has 16 “flutes” (flat edges) around its circumference. So, for an oil filter cap removal tool to be fit the stock cap, it must be a bit larger than ~86.34 mm but not too much larger or it will not be able to grip the cap, and it must also have 16 internal flutes to grab onto the flutes on the BMW cap. The flutes must also be slightly rounded in a convex shape because the flutes on the BMW cap are concave, and there must be gaps between the flutes in the tool for the sharp edges on the cap. If any of these features are incorrect, the tool will not be compatible with the BMW oil cap, or have a poor grip on the cap which can cause damage due to excessive movement or being too tight - and that’s exactly what you see on my cap where the there seems to be white wear marks along the edge of the flutes. This is why you don’t cheap out and buy a cheap oil filter cap removal tool.BMS Billet Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo these are the images of the BMS Billet Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool, and lets go over some of its features:1) 3/8\" drive socket: The BMS Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool can accept 3/8\" drive ratchets directly, so you can just use your medium torque wrenches for the oil filter cap, and you can use your standard ratchets as well.2) 21 mm Hex: The BMS Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool alternatively can accept 21 mm sockets via the 21 mm hex on top of the cap which doubles as the receptacle for 3/8\" drive tools. This gives you additional flexibility on how you want to interface with this tool.3) Made in the USA: This imo is an absolutely critical feature of this oil filter cap removal tool, and that it is made by BMS in the USA. Why is it important? Well because generally speaking quality control is significantly better when products are made in the US compared to being made in China. This means tolerances will be kept in line and this is really important for this tool's fitment as we will discuss momentarily.4) CNC machined Billet Aluminum: CNC machining the BMS oil filter cap removal tool from a single piece of billet aluminum allows it to be quite strong meaning it will last and not sheer apart - something we will talk about later, and again another benefit of the BMS cap. CNC machine also allows for great precision if a high quality multi axis machine is used, and again precision is important.BMS Billet Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool vs. Some of the Competition:Credit: F87SourceNow the last thing I would like to do is compare the BMS Billet Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool vs. some of the competition. I currently have 2 alternatives on hand but I used to have one more that I threw away because the top sheared off.So in the image above I have a cast aluminum oil filter tool from Amazon on top, the BMS oil filter tool from BMS in the middle, and a stamped steel absolute piece of garbage from Aliexpress on the bottom.Let’s begin by analyzing the BMS option:Credit: F87SourceSo the BMS option is also a standard 16 flute wrench with a diameter of ~86.39 mm (it could be slightly bigger since measuring this wasn’t easy due to its convex flutes, but this is what I measured myself), this is only ~0.05 mm larger than the stock cap. The BMS oil filter cap also has very nicely designed flutes with the proper gaps between them so it sits and fits the stock BMW oil filter cap perfectly, and has very little play once it is on the cap. This is what it looks like on the BMW oil filter cap:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceView post on imgur.comCredit: F87SourceSo as you can see by the photos above, the BMS oil filter tool sits perfectly on the stock BMW oil filter cap and completely envelopes the stock cap from top to bottom. From the video you can also see that there is very very little play when the BMS oil filter tool is on the BMW oil cap. This means the BMS oil filter cap was designed with the proper diameter, and the correct flute shape and flute gaps. So you will not have to worry about the BMS cap moving too much while you use it to loosen or tighten the stock oil cap, and this means you will not have to worry about the oil filter tool “skipping a flute” (has too much play so it turns so much that instead of grabbing onto a flute it is grabbing onto the corners between flutes and gets stuck) and damaging the stock cap or getting stuck onto it. There is only one very minor concern for me which I would like to see BMS fix and that is the top of the inside of the tool is flat, while the top of the oil filter cap is round. This causes the tool to wobble a tiny bit when placed on top of the oil filter cap, it’s not a huge deal because it nearly bottoms out around the cap but it is a small thing I noticed. To fix this BMS could make the tool a bit deeper so the top of the cap doesn’t touch the inside roof of the tool, or they could make the inside roof of the tool round like the oil filter cap.Next let’s talk about the Amazon tool:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceView post on imgur.comCredit: F87SourceSo the Amazon tool, this one is a mixed bag for me. Because it appears to have well designed flutes and a round internal roof to match the oil filter cap. But like the images show, it has an internal diameter of ~87.21 mm instead of the advertised 86.6 mm, and this is about 1% larger than the stock cap. This leads to mixed results, on one hand it sits on top of the stock oil filter cap really well and completely covers the cap, this means there is no wobble like on the BMS tool. However, imo the inner diameter is way too large and this means there is way too much play as seen in the video (so despite having decent flutes, the larger diameter pretty much makes those flutes useless because it introduces too much play). The amount of play on this cap is borderline a flaw and almost allows the tool to skip flutes. So everytime I use this tool to remove and reinstall my oil filter cap, it nearly skips to the next flute and pretty much gets caught on the edges. This means my stock cap is getting slightly damaged with each use (as seen by the white marks on the corners I alluded to before - and this is really bad if you have an aftermarket aluminum oil filter cap because it will damage the finish), and the worst part is that because of the excessive play, my cap gets stuck inside the tool and I have to wedge it off everytime. So that shows you how important tolerances and internal diameter really is, because normally 1% difference is acceptable, but in the case of the oil cap I personally find that 1% to be too much of a difference and it leads to way too much movement and play. Overall imo this cap is not good, but it isn’t bad either and I have been using it for the past 3 years.Finally, let’s look at the Aliexpress tool.This tool is absolutely garbage and it should have been thrown away a long time ago:Credit: F87SourceView post on imgur.comCredit: F87SourceSo the Aliexpress tool, imo there is nothing good to say about this thing at all. The inside diameter is 86.60 mm, so only 0.26 mm larger than the stock cap. But the flutes are non-existent, it is almost perfectly smooth inside of the cap, and the edges for the corners to slot into are also barely defined. As a result this cap doesn’t fit at all, no matter how hard I try to get it on the stock cap I can’t - as shown in the video. This goes to show you that despite having the proper internal diameter, the flutes are also really important to the design, because if they aren’t designed well the cap will not fit.Also these cheap stamped steel caps are absolutely trash imo. From what I have gathered they often deform under load so the stock cap either gets stuck onto the oil filter cap and you cannot get them off, or the nut on top sheers off. For example:https://www.e90post.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1590503So in my opinion this is why you should get the BMS tool instead of the cheaper competition from Aliexpress or Amazon (meaning the designs that I tested and imo believe to be inferior), because from my testing it is the only one with the internal diameter and flutes both correctly designed to limit the amount of play it has on the stock cap.Note: There could be others out there as good as the BMS tool, but I can’t comment on those ones as I have not tested them, so I can only recommend the BMS tool.Summary:So overall the BMS Billet Oil Filter Cap Removal Tool is a high quality tool (and imo the best one available on the market) that every BMW owner should have at their disposal to properly remove and reinstall + torque their oil filter cap during oil changes. The BMS tool has properly designed flutes and the proper internal diameter that cheaper alternatives do not have and this can lead to the damage of your stock oil filter cap, so my advice is to not waste your money buying anything else and just get the BMS tool from the beginning.

I'd still want to do some of my own testing, because it's rated at 86.6 mm so it is going to have more play than the BMS tool. I suspect it's a tiny bit larger to accommodate for the other cars that it's going to be used on.\n\nThanks for the review.

I can get the Motivx one via Amazon without worrying about the shipping but the ~2mm difference made me stick to the BMS one, it'll take some time to arrive but in exchange for peace of mind.Yup no worries, I recommend also getting the BMS wheel pin tool if you're going to be buying from BMS anyways. It really is a nice thing to have when removing wheels - especially the front ones because they spin without a parking brake to hold the wheel still. This means the wheel can easily fall off of the hub. I would also get 2 wheel pin tools, because one isn't enough to hold the wheel secure, it is enough to allow for easy wheel removal and reinstall but not holding - and I learned that the hard way when my wheel spun and fell off.Also I'd get a jack pad adapter as the last item. Optional things are the spark plug gapping tool and wheel socket too, then you pretty much have the full set of tools to work on your car.For mods I'd get the intercooler, charge pipe, and inlet from BMS. That's pretty much it if you want to buy it all at once and save on shipping. But it's completely up to you since you're looking at a ~$20 you might not want to go for hundreds of dollars in mods right away haha.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceYup no worries, I recommend also getting the BMS wheel pin tool if you're going to be buying from BMS anyways.

Gold tape is supposed to have an even higher thermal reflectivity, but silver is what I went with since it matches the silver firewall heat shielding and my chrome strut brace better. Gold is also a bit too \"loud\" imo, but maybe I will rewrap it gold in the future. So don't follow my footsteps you can do better with gold tape.The link you posted doesn't work.Yes you can indeed use that tape, use it for the intake tube, and the charge pipes, and turbo inlet. When using these tapes I would recommend gloves because the fiber glass from the tape can get embedded into your fingers and this is really itchy and annoying and it stays stuck for a week or so before coming loose. I'd probably wear a mask or respirator so you don't breath it in either, for me I found alot of fiber glass particles were getting flung into the air when I cut the tape.Also clean the surface well so it doesn't come unbonded.So like I said above I'd recommend protecting the charge pipes, the intake tube, turbo inlet (unless you have a silicone one because the tape likely wont stick too well to that), and that's about it. If you are doing a coolant flush you can tape the coolant pipe to the engine block too, because it is super close to the exhaust manifold and that can't be good for coolant temps.",

They make a little rattle all the way back to my 07 335 cars I had.\n\nthis is way old but if you haven't figured it out by now, there is a spring clip thats likely missing. Mine broke after 7 years.

    "title": "Speed Dependent Ticking Noise",
    "content": "Hello all,I have been experiencing a speed dependent tapping/ticking noise from my right rear for the last two months or so and I have had no luck diagnosing it. Has anyone else dealt with this before?It is a fairly light noise, and only noticeable between about 5 and 30 MPH. It sounds almost like a zip tie is around the axle and is smacking a suspension arm, but I have looked and found nothing, and a shop putting it on the rack was able to recreate the noise but has not been able to diagnose it.SSR had the car up on a lift and removed/checked the wheels, ended up replacing the rear left axle seal which was leaking, but nothing has fixed the issue. I am wondering now if there is something in the brake dust shield, but I have no clear answers.I'll try to take a video later and post it, but wondering if someone else has dealt with it before.\n\nPossibly a rear parking brake not fully disengaging which wouldnt be visible with a wheel off.I had this issue. To much bs to type my whole story but its worth considering in your case.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byThreeStripesPossibly a rear parking brake not fully disengaging which wouldnt be visible with a wheel off.I had this issue. To much bs to type my whole story but its worth considering in your case.What was the solution in your case to that issue? Just adjusting via the hole in the hub?\n\n\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byallinon72Tommy is great but unfortunately OP has traced it to the rear.My issue was/is the rear parking brake not fully disengaging when the handle is fully depressed. BMW dealership to thank for it. When I got mine and it was under warranty I took it to the dealer to have them install the updated brake dust shields. The rears required removal/replacement of the parking brake assembly and it took the tech an extra day to do it because he was struggling.When I get the car back, the parking brake neeeever felt quite the same. The pull was off. Didnt want to be the guy whining to a service manager that the FEEL of my parking brake pull isnt right so I let it be. Cut to 3yrs later, precisely one week before a track weekend and Ive got a rotational noise I cant pin down coming from the rear. I presumed just like you that something was caught in the dust shield.After thoroughly visually inspecting and removing pads I realized that wasnt it and it hit me F parking brake. So I pulled the brake juuuust a hair and spun the wheel and MF if that wasnt the same sound. Fortunately a hard yank of the e-brake and a hard release was enough to disengage everything and my noise is gone but, it definitely isnt completely addressed.YMMV. God speed.\n\nI had a similar problem like a ticking sound from the rear. Sometimes squeaking and clicking. And it ended up being a loose/ broken break pad ear. Replaced the pads and it went away 🤷&zwj;♂️",

To say they solved the problem would be a little over stating the facts.  BMW's efforts to provide the N55 the ability to resolve the blow-by issue noteworthy, but it is not full proof, especially under boost from what I read from my reading forums and research.  So I am looking to purchase a catch can for my new f87 M2 N55.  On sites for both ECS and Turner they offer two alternatives.  One is an: ECS-tuning-baffled-oil-catch-can-8oz and the other is a TURNER-baffled-oil-catch-can-kit-standard-flow-6oz.

Just turn the car to accessory mode, heater to high, fan speed 1, low beams on, press gas pedal all the way down till the water pump runs. It will go for about 10 mins.In 2020 when I did my coolant bleed I used my ctek in supply mode and bleed the system 10-15 times consecutively till the coolant didn't drop anymore.

Then I know if what I put in roughly matches what came out, and I have a high likelihood that it's properly filled.I've done coolant twice on my M235, which essentially the same N55 as the M2.  Only used the electronic bleed process.  Both times the volumes were within 100ml of each other.So, I'm thinking the electronic bleed alone is fine.  I'm sure the full vacuum has advantages, but some of those advantages might just be faster cleaner fills in a production shop environment.  No carefully pouring fluid into a tippy funnel at a slow rate.  Just one big simple whoosh and it's done.  Could also just be a BMW habit thing given their history of needing it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byggggbmwWhen changing any fluid, I like to collect everything that came out, and measure it.

This is because once a bolt is stretched, it is permanently deformed as it has gone past its elastic deformation stage and into plastic deformation making the deformation irreversible. This means the bolt is now stretched and it can no longer provide the correct clamping force that bmw expects when they calculated the torque + stretch angle, also the bolt once it has gone plastic is now weakened and if you try to stretch it again you risk snapping or shearing the bolt. This is a huge PITA because now you have to remove a broken bolt that could be stuck really deep inside of a hole which is never fun. So imo always replace single use bolts.If you must reuse a bolt, just apply the torque and don't yield it. So maybe do half or 1/4 of the stretch angle and leave it at that until you're able to replace the bolt.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceIf the bolts were torqued and yielded (torqued to a spec like 80 ft-lbs for example, then add an extra angle twist to it 90 degrees to stretch the bolt), then you need to replace them.

TIS just specifies a specific torque value on them. I think TIS also wants people to change bolts on the carbon brace everytime its removed.I am tempted to just leave em beSome bolts are recommended to be changed even though there is not angle to the torque spec, but that's because they're still torqued to plastic deformation range. A good example is the brake caliper bolts, the front and rear caliper carrier bolts are the exact same. However only the rear caliper bolts require a torque angle, yet you have to replace them with each use. This is because the front bolts are torqued high enough to become plastically deformed, thus they're single use. Iirc the front bolts are 80 ftlbs, and the rears were like 30 ftlbs + 90 degrees.Sometimes bmw specs to replace bolts because of corrosion issues and the risk of stripping, for instance the rotor retention bolts. These aren't torqued high enough to plastically deform yet they're replaced each time because they're so proned to coroding and stripping out.The brace bolts are likely torqued to plastic deformation, hence why they're single use. So imo if bmw says to replace it, chances are it needs to be replaced or else you risk not getting accurate clamling loads or a broken bolt.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceSome bolts are recommended to be changed even though there is not angle to the torque spec, but that's because they're still torqued to plastic deformation range.

I see some that look OK at both FCP Euro and Turner Motorsport. Some are vinyl. Some are soft/cloth. Some have magnets, some don't. None of them stand out to me as THE ONE to buy.My searches on the forum turned up empty. So I'd love any recommendations if any of you have a fender cover that works really nicely with your M2. Thanks in advance!\n\nI use the GearWrench one mainly because it was gifted to me during a previous life. I see that it's on sale now on Amazon for about $20.It covers a fairly large surface area, attaches with magnets, and the surface has a nice texture to it. Doesn't have tool pockets, though I'm not sure how I feel about those, in general. I'm sure there are better options at full price but at a discount it's worth buying.If you're doing enough flushes, consider looking into a vacuum bleeder too. Makes the one-man job a little bit easier.\n\nI use this one [1] from OEM tools, it's pretty decent and you can remove the magnets to wash it.With that said you don't really need it, you can just put a few microfiber towels to shield sensitive areas. Keep a bottle/spray of soapy water nearby when you do it so you can wipe and wash the fluid right away if you splash some brake fluid where you should not.Also, if you can I recommend you get a pressure bleeder, it makes the job much easier to do alone.[1]:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LCEVJGM\n\nThanks for the fender cover recommendations, I appreciate it!Quote:Originally Posted by(K)If you're doing enough flushes, consider looking into a vacuum bleeder too.

I ended up getting one from FCP Euro made by GearWrench (the one recommended by (K) above):https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/fen...arwrench-86991I like it pretty well. The magnets hold it place on the fenders quite securely. The \"tool trough\" on top is deep enough to keep tools in place (and the extra tool weight further anchors the cover in place). It's thick enough to feel like it's doing a good job protecting the paintwork from spills and drops.If I were to offer a critique: I wish it were every-so-slightly taller so it would cover more of the car. This is especially when I have it covering the front bumper cover as I lean into the front of the engine bay.And definitely on the plus side, I got this from FCP Euro: when it cracks/rips/ages, I'll just put the the lifetime replacement policy into action.\n\nI bought a microfibre \"fender cover\" from a detailing shop, I think it offers enough protection for brake fluid changes. I should probably get a proper one that would offer more peace of mind during other work in the engine bay.If you want to just go for a microfibre option then you probably could just buy a 20x40\" towel or something, mine was listed specifically as a fender cover but it doesn't really seem all that different to other large glass cleaning microfibre towels.",

Prior to starting, I made sure to fill it to \"Max.\"My question is, what should I do to correct this?Do I just fill the brake cylinder back to full and fill the bleeder tank, and finish off the flush, or would I have to start everything over again?Or did I cause an even more serious problem?I've heard to never let the brake cylinder run empty to avoid introducing air but I'm afraid that's what happened thus causing the air to come out while bleeding.FWIW, I never pressed the brake pedal the whole time I was doing the flush, not sure if it matters...Also, I'm concerned about air in the ABS system now and I'm not sure how to resolve that with ISTA+Thanks for your help\n\nIf you introduced air in the system you need to re-bleed everything including the ABS module. Bleeding the ABS module is done via ISTA.\n\nYou will need to run a lot of fluid through the system to clear the air. I ran my reservoir empty while trying to use the ABS process in ISTA after rebuilding my calipers, I think I ended up running a total of 1-1.5L through and was able to get a solid pedal again.You will want to basically go around the car on each corner at least twice, the first time around was basically as I would for a complete fluid swap with the exception of not really trying to empty the reservoir with a pump/syringe first. Then after you finish your first cycle around, go back and check again, this time only really open the bleed screw to see if you get any air and allow a small amount to flow through if you don't see any bubbles. Also perhaps if you can easily do a test drive, you can check for a soft pedal, and then do a final check on each corner again.Do be careful about not opening the bleed screw too far and having air come in through the threads of the bleed screw, trying to hurry the process by opening the bleed screw wide can just make everything take longer. This is when I would have hated to be working on jack stands, my QuickJack doesn't give the quickest or easiest access but it's 5-10 minutes to lift the car, take all the wheels off and then put them back on, drop the car and torque and be able to test drive.\n\nI totally understand how you feel.  I was doing a quick caliper bleed before a track weekend, and didn't bother filling the pressure bleeder.  Just watching the reservoir.  Then I dropped the wrench to close the bleeder, and by the time I retrieved it from under the car and got the bleeder closed I had air in the system.If you tried to rebleed that line without touching anything, youmighthave gotten lucky and just refilled the path. But if you touch the brake pedal, that's it, you are going to have to do the full ABS cycle bleed.I had to do the ABS bleed process 4 times before I finally got rid of the soft pedal.  Went through 3 liters of brake fluid.  Buy something cheapish for this.  (I use Pentosin LV in the off-season.)  Don't be using expensive racing fluid.  You can always reflush with the good stuff after the brakes are solid again.If you have access to ISTA, it does a nice job of walking you through the whole process with illustrations.  But you don't need it.  Most of the better active/bi-directional scan tools with BMW aware software can do the ABS cycle flush.  I use the Schwaben scan tool (a rebranded Foxwell NT510 w BMW add-on), and I'm fairly sure Bimmerlink will do it (but you should research that).One odd thing is that the ABS bleed does not do all four corners.  It just does the left front and left rear.  That is why it is critical to do a full normal flush before doing the ABS flush.  The 'left side only' confused me with with the scan tool at first, so I found ISTA.  And it does the same thing, but with better explanations.  The procedure is a bit complex.  It's a good idea to go through the process without actually opening bleeders just to get the sequence down.  It can help if you have two people.  One to run the process and push the pedal.  And one to open/close bleeders and pump/release the pressure bleeder.Also, don't panic if the ABS flush ends with a 'failure' code.  I've never gotten a 'success'.  I'm not sure what isn't working, but it is still flushing the system and doing what it needs to.  I'm sure I'm messing up the process somewhere and not pressing the pedal hard/soft/fast/slow enough, but it still works.One full flush, and one ABS cycle got me 90% restored to normal.  But to get the pedal completely firm again took another full bleed, and 3 more ABS cycles.\n\nYup, definitely get some cheaper fluid as you'll go through a bunch, don't use SRF or anything like that since it's a complete waste.",

Also the dsc/abs module is in then engine bay and should be warmed up by the engine heat meaning the fluid inside shouldnhe warm enough that the abs/dsc module valves are able to respond as quick as they need to.Plus dot 4 brings in fluid with a higher working temp which is nice when you want to do autox, light track, and street useage on a single fluid. It saves the pain of flushing fluid all the time.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719I would run DOT 4 LV or DOT 5.1 on the street.

It might not make a huge difference from track fluid, but if I'm driving on ice, I want the ABS/DSC to work as well as it possibly can.Then, in the spring, I put in the Castrol SRF when I put the track pads on, and I'm good for the summer.  Since SRF should really be flushed every year this keeps me on a good schedule.Am I diluting the SRF with residual LV?  I'm sure I am.  But not enough that it is affecting the calipers which get full flow when flushed.  And SRF is fully miscible with standard DOT 4 fluid, so I don't worry about the minimal mixing going on.  I also make sure to drain as much fluid from the reservoir as I can between fluids to keep mixing to a minimum.  Have a long skinny tube on the end of syringe to get deep in there.  (And don't forget to refill the reservoir with new stuff before bleeding!)\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byggggbmwFor standard fluid I use Pentosin LV.

This can be used to actively charge the battery like a power supply and keep it at full conditions, and in such a case we are using it to try and slow the loss of battery charge while we are using it to actuate the ABS pump or perform flash tuning. Obviously 7 AMPS is not enough to keep the battery from draining but it will slow the drain and give us more time to acomplish our task. That is why we are using supply mode.",

For example you can code traction control settings, power steering, and differential - and you can't code any of these things with bimmer code.For me I have all 3 tools (protool, bimmer code and bimmer link) but prefer protool.

Before we begin I must thank ECS tuning/Turner motorsports for giving me a partial discount on the products that I will be using in this review, however I will be as unbiased as possible despite that.Disclaimer:Any technical advice, installation instruction, or product installation is done so at your own risk I will not be responsible for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being(s), or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.How a modern day continental belt wears:So for those of you that do not know, these modern day continental serpentine belts that bmw uses are made from a new compound that no longer cracks when these belts age. This means that a visual inspection for belt wear no longer works to judge belt life, instead these belts wear thinner as they are used - just like car tires. This means you must measure rib height to determine belt life, and even rib spacing (due to wear from the grooves on the pulley and potential stretching). This measurement can be done with a cheap tool that continental makes called the contitech belt wear tester tool (more on this later). So if you hear people say this belt looks good referring to it being relatively clean and free of cracks and they did not use a continental belt wear tester - their judgement is inaccurate and doesnt signify belt health at all.Continental Belt Wear Tester Images:Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceWhat happens when a serpentine belt fails:When a serpentine belt fails it can wrap itself around the harmonic dampener which then in turns sucks the belt behind it and forces it past the front crank seal. From there the timing chain sprocket and oil pump sprocket chews up the serpentine belt and some of that belt material gets carried up into the head via the timing chain. The parts that do not get pulled up into the head gets fed into the oil pan where it can clog up the oil pump pick up causing catastrophic engine damage and if the engine hasnt failed yet a costly repair would be required, more on this in this thread:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1807187where I discuss this issue indepth and also discuss a solution to permanently prevent any engine damage from belt  failures. But this is a quick summary on what happens when a belt fails.How to check belt wear and when to replace these belts:So how do we prevent serpentine belt failures from occurring? Well the first method to tackle the belt failing is commonly checking the belt for wear (this will not eliminate all belt failures caused by other issues as discussed in this thread:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1807187). This can be accomplished using the tool that continental has created called the contitech belt wear tester:https://www.continental-engineparts....elt-Wear-GaugeThis tool as shown in the above video allows the user to check the depth of the grooves and width of the rib spacing, allowing for an accurate determination of when to replace your belt because these belts wear thinner and will not show its age by cracking as mentioned earlier. With this tool you can always keep an eye on your belts wear and replace it before it breaks and potentially causes engine failure.Now this is where ECS tuning/Turner motorsports comes in clutch, I have looked everywhere for these testers and no one sells them except for ECS tuning/Turner motorsports, so big props to these guys for stocking all the cool things that no one else does. So if you are looking for this handy little tool here is the link to buy it:https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-3...t-wear-tester/it is really cheap so I highly recommend those who maintain their cars by themselve to purchase one.Before we wrap up this review I would like to also quickly summarize when to replace your serpentine belt:1) When the grooves become to shallow as indicated by the belt wear tester2)When the rib spacing becomes too wide that the teeth of the belt wear tester no longer fit snuggly3) When the belt is over 5-6 years old, now this is the recommendation I was given when speaking to continental and not many people know about this but belts can degrade over time due to ozone damage (ozone degrades rubber) and constant heat cycling. So make sure you replace your belts if they pass this time frame even if the tester shows they are fine, $30 for a new belt is much cheaper than the hundreds or thousands of dollars in parts and labour to repair your engine.Overall I recommend bmw owners spare a bit of time and money to do the proper preventative maintenance to take care of your car, otherwise the consequences of not doing so can cost many times more.\n\nReserved for future posts.\n\nThe OP pointed my attention to this belt wear tester on another thread.

My car has only 39,500 mi (~63,500 km)  it seems far too early to replace the tensioner and idler pulley.

The tensioner will start to wobble alot when it's wearing out (and do the things that kll describe for that pulley) and the pulley squeals, doesn't spin smoothly (binds), and or wobbles. So if your tensioner and pulley doesn't do those things you're fine. Mileage shouldn't really matter too too much for these parts unless you want to replace them preemptively.If you reuse a belt down the line make sure you mark direction of rotation and reinstall in the same direction. These belts will wear a certain way so that's why this is important.\n\nthe only reason I would just replace everything is because of the work you have to do to replace belt, while you are there kind of thing even though it will be a bit more work (one of the idler pulleys needs the oil lines to be removed (unless you have a T55 that is skinny enough to get there, I know some have gotten it to work but then I don't think there will be a torque wrench thin enough to get int here so best way is to remove the oil lines in front). That said I am also into just replacing stuff that is needed, specially with relatively low miles (even though my idler pulley was making noise and I just replaced it at 32k, I shoulda have replaced the belt while I was there but was cold).I wish I had one of these measurers handy to at least measure the belt while I had access to it. About to go and try to find one\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMooMooM2the only reason I would just replace everything is because of the work you have to do to replace belt, while you are there kind of thing even though it will be a bit more work (one of the idler pulleys needs the oil lines to be removed (unless you have a T55 that is skinny enough to get there, I know some have gotten it to work but then I don't think there will be a torque wrench thin enough to get int here so best way is to remove the oil lines in front).Im running an M2 LCI with the N55 motor and 6MT. So the belt and pulley area is pretty free and clear of obstruction compared to the cars with the S55 motor. See attached image of my engine bay. For me, I think itll be OK to get in there now just for the belt and again later on for pulleys and tensioners.Quote:Originally Posted byMooMooM2I wish I had one of these measurers handy to at least measure the belt while I had access to it.

    "title": "M2 Alignment Issues",
    "content": "I know this has been covered before in other BMW threads but I wanted to get opinions from M2 owners. My vehicle has pulled to the right from day 1, doesn't matter how straight the road is and tire pressure is perfect.  Is this a common problem and what is your experience with the dealership in rectifying the situation under warranty?\n\nSomething is obviously \"out\". Depending upon how long you have had it, it may have tapped a curb, as such...or someone did in transferring car in shipping.Might be worth having a \"first opinion\" from an independent shop for a \"check\".THEN back to dealer for their inspect and correction and warranty? They might balk, claiming you curbed it somehow. If you are catching very soon after purchase, they should stand behind the adjustments.No problem with mine on this--but it would be certainly unnerving. The above would be what I would do; but I have a greaaat dealer who will fix it without question.\n\nThanks for you feedback zkeeper, I've only driven it 1000 miles in 6 months, never curb checked nor has it been abused in any manor.  It doesn't pull in extreme but definitely noticeable, my question is our people experiencing the same thing with there new vehicle?  Did the dealership check the alignment and or adjust it under warranty after concern.  I go for my first service in 2 weeks I guess I'll find out, thanks again.\n\nWhen you have someone take a look at it keep in mind that front caster and camber are not adjustable on the M2. Only thing that can be adjusted in front is the Toe.\n\nInteresting fact, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the insight.\n\nI wonder if this has somthing to do with it, I thought it was only a rumor.Caster is a bit harder to conceptualize, but it’s defined as the angle created by the steerings pivot point from the front to back of the vehicle. Caster is positive if the line is angled forward, and negative if backward.Typically, positive caster will make the vehicle more stable at high speeds, and will increase tire lean when cornering. This can also increase steering effort as well.Most road vehicles have what is called cross-caster. Cross castered vehicles have slightly different caster and camber, which cause it to drift slightly to the right while rolling. This is a safety feature so that un-manned vehicles or drivers who lose steering control will drift toward the side of the road instead of into oncoming traffic.\n\nMine definitely pulls to the right. I have 1700 miles. I was partially blaming the responsive suspension + tires, but the more I drive it the more I think it's just out. It never drives straight no matter what road I find. I won't be bothering with the dealership and will just take it to a reputable independent shop I frequently use.\n\nThanks blefevre, I knew it wasn't just me.  For now I'll try my luck at the dealership next weekend.  I plain on getting a quote from Fabspeed for MPS or Eibach spring installation & alignment.\n\nMine goes straight as an arrow.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMSULLYI know this has been covered before in other BMW threads but I wanted to get opinions from M2 owners. My vehicle has pulled to the right from day 1, doesn't matter how straight the road is and tire pressure is perfect.  Is this a common problem and what is your experience with the dealership in rectifying the situation under warranty?Mine pulls to the right as well and I had noticed it from Day 1 picking up the car. I chose to ignore it thinking it was just me. More I drove the car I noticed it and didn't feel right. My car has approx. 900 miles and taking it in for service this week. Going to mention it, hopefully they can resolve the problem or else going to take it to a reputable shop..\n\n900 miles... no issues here. I had my MY17 aligned and corner balanced recently since I had MP Coilovers installed a week ago.\n\nPlease let me know how you make out at the dealership. As another member mention, the front caster and camber are not adjustable on the M2 only Front Toe.  I'm curious if it would help, IMO I would say not much. Might be a safety thing after all, anyone from across the pond notice it pulling left?  * Right Hand Drive.\n\nDealer thought nothing was wrong with it.. Possibly getting a new suspension installed next month. Maybe when it is installed and I get the car aligned it could be better. Will keep updating you if I find out or see any change.\n\nPicked up my M2 on 03/11, over 800 miles so far. I could tell there was a very slight pull to the right on straight smooth roads pretty much right away. This past weekend I was out for a county buzz breaking the car in, feeling things out. I spent time on the left side of a two lane road - on the other side of the crown. Turns out it pulls slightly to the left when you are on \"the other side of the crown\", seems to be about equal. Find a road where you can test the same.I highly doubt one tire (ie Conti to PSS) does this more over the other. I would image it would be pretty much the same. Basically, the car wants to move down hill (to the right) of the slight camber in the road. Just my thoughts...\n\nI'm wondering if the factory alignment specs alittle toe out.  I'm have found that even a small toe out makes a car alittle \"darty\" and have a tendency to flow the slope of a crowned road even with perceived zero steering input.I must point out that even the driver perceived \"flattest\" public road have a crown for water drainage.\n\nA dealer is not going to align a car very well, The factory specs are very broad in toe so if you notice you need to get someone to allign it closer then spec, for me no more than 1/32 diff on any point.  You may also be following the crown of the road, you could add some toe in the front  and that would help but would reduce performance.The suspension geometry in the rear is very complex, and toe in or out in the rear can cause the pull, so can toe in the front, but that is pretty easy to adjust, the rear, needs to be adjusted and settled, and then rechecked.This should take 2 hours for a good alignment shop because it needs to settle, and then go back on the rack. Then when done, driven and back on the rack.  I would look for a race or performance shop to do it, I gave up in my area and bought the equipment to do it myself.\n\nThanks for all the insight and suggestions everyone.  The last comment from Pparana is very valid point. There's a good chance that the dealer could make it worse due to the loose specks from BMW considering it to be truly aligned. It does indeed seem to warrant a professional alignment IMO now. Money out of my pocket I dont want to spend, nor should I have to.I was considering the Eibach springs & realignment down the road (HATE the front wheel gap) but I wanted to really enjoy/drive this one before dumping in more $. My 4K cosmetic/protection job is still leaving me with a sore butt.  If the problem persists to get worse I'll take her into the dealer under warranty and share my experience.\n\nIf they use the New BMW alignment equipment it is some of the best out there if it was calibrated and leveled when it was installed.  I only have my dealer do my alignments and they set it to what I want.  Alignment is somewhat of art and I use to do it but if to alignments all day when your a tech and you care about how the drives you can't make a living.  The specs are not that loose and 5% of the time a consistent pull is from a tire and would drive me up a wall.\n\nMine drifts to the right too.  After I installed the eibach pro kit and turner spacers I wanted to test the alignment again since the shop did an alignment after they installed the parts and it still drifted to the right. I drove the wife's 2016 X1 and it also pulls to the right. That's when I came to the conclusion that it might be the way it was designed for safety reason as stated before.\n\nIf you search my other posts you will see that I had a shop check the alignment on my 2 week old car and it was not within factory specs....had to align it correctly and it drove a hell of a lot better.\n\nAbout 7300 miles on mine. This may be something I obsessively check while driving. If I check and the car does pull in a particular direction it's the road (love California freeways in la). On smooth roads it's a s straight as an arrow, with no directional curiosities.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMSULLYI know this has been covered before in other BMW threads but I wanted to get opinions from M2 owners. My vehicle has pulled to the right from day 1, doesn't matter how straight the road is and tire pressure is perfect.  Is this a common problem and what is your experience with the dealership in rectifying the situation under warranty?If the vehicle pulls to the right on all roads and you have to put just a little bit of left wheel in all the time, that is not right.Wheel alignment is covered up to the first 2,000 miles on the vehicle.  I would press the dealer to get this fixed before you do any modification.  It seems like this is becoming more of a problem.  There is also a thread on the f80/f82 forum about pulling to the right issues.  If the alignment specs are good and it still pulls to the right, it could be another issue causing the pull, electric power steering rack, Front struts, or other suspension components. I would hesitate to have the dealer adjust the front camber  with new swivel bearings, it may fix the pull but then the alignment might be out.  The more people that complain about the pulling to the right issue, the more BMW NA will be willing to look into the big issue.",

    "title": "M2 Competition DCT loosenes in the drivetrain",
    "content": "Some time ago I started noticing weird behavior in my M2 competition DCT. When the car was rolling (without touching a throttle), and then giving a decent amount of gas (less than required to break traction) sometimes you'd feel a \"double push\" in the back from the acceleration. It felt like there was something \"loose\"/with play in the drivetrain.I suspected something was off and reported it to BMW. I was informed after a test drive with a tech that it was \"normal\" - the car is DCT and when off the throttle it was disengaging clutches and when pressing the throttle it was engaging them, that's why I could feel \"double push\". Didn't buy it, I was 100% sure it wasn't like that before (the car was at ~55kkm) and insisted they check it on the lift. They found the transmission mount was starting to break and that if I wanted they could replace it under warranty. I agreed and after the repair, I couldn't reproduce the \"double push\" again.They also said that there was very little play in the axle shafts but nothing out of spec that should be addressed. I was happy that I no longer felt the \"double push\" and didn't pursue this.I feel like something is loose/there is more play now (now at 60kkm and warranty about to expire) and gonna take it to BMW but wanted to ask a few questions, fellow forum users:1. Is the statement about \"little play in the axle shafts is normal\" true or have I been bamboozled?2. When the car is on even ground, switched off in gear, and no handbrake engaged when pulling/pushing the car forward/backward it moves a little and at the \"edge\" it makes a clinking noise. Managed to capture it onView post on imgur.com.3. Same conditions as in 2 but the single rear wheel in the air, when trying to rotate it, it rotates a little and at the max of the rotation, I can hear very similar noise as in 2. Is that normal?4. Any suggestions on what else should I make them look at before the warranty expires?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypotato1337the car is DCT and when off the throttle it was disengaging clutches and when pressing the throttle it was engaging them, that's why I could feel \"double push\"This is 100% BS, the clutches are engaged whenever you are in gear.Do you feel/hear knocking on the rear axle during load reversals (step on the throttle, let off, step on the throttle again?If yes, it could be your differential bushings, or (like it was the case for me), some of the driveshaft bolts coming loose.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byc0riolisThis is 100% BS, the clutches are engaged whenever you are in gear.Do you feel/hear knocking on the rear axle during load reversals (step on the throttle, let off, step on the throttle again?If yes, it could be your differential bushings, or (like it was the case for me), some of the driveshaft bolts coming loose.Try stopping on a hill and then let your foot off of the brake.

(& no throttle)After the hill hold releases the brakes the car will roll freely.This is true, the clutches are disengaged when you stop, but the OP mentioned that he was already rolling forward so I assumed that his clutch was already engaged when taking his foot off the throttle.I should have said the opposite: the clutch is never disengaged unless you stop or force the car to neutral by holding the gear selector in the left position.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byc0riolisThis is 100% BS, the clutches are engaged whenever you are in gear.Quote:Originally Posted byc0riolisI should have said the opposite: the clutch is never disengaged unless you stop or force the car to neutral by holding the gear selector in the left position.Yeah, DCT is pretty noisy and you can actually hear the clutch disengage when putting the gearbox into neutral when rolling (by moving the gear selector to the left) or when coming to a complete stop. It doesn't happen when rolling and lifting off the throttle. That's why I didn't buy this \"clutches get partially disengaged when off the throttle\" bullshit.What do you think about the noise from questions 2 and 3? Does that seem normal or out of order?",

I realized earlier this year I have an unopened jug from maybe 3 years ago sitting in my non temperature regulated garage. Im wondering if its best to toss it. Thank you!\n\nI probably could've done some due diligence and searched before posting; something I'm clearly a hypocrite of in this instance and generally recommend others to do as well.From Pennzoil themselves:Quote:Motor Oil Bottle Storage – At home, motor oil should be stored in a clean, dry place such as a cabinet or shelf. Make sure to check older motor oil to see if it is still good and on the specification for your vehicle’s engine even if it is the proper viscosity grade.Pennzoil Platinum motor oils can have a shelf-life of up to four years if stored properly.Old motor oil should be properly disposed of if no longer useable....Additionally, please keep in mind that in a home or garage,the recommended storage temperature for motor oil is between 40 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It is best to make sure it is not kept in a location where it can get too cold or too hot to maintain the lifespan of the motor oil.Reference:https://www.pennzoil.com/en_us/educa...l-storage.htmlLooks like I'm going to dispose it, since my garage has definitely seen temperatures under 40F (~4C).",

    "title": "Replacing wiper fluid pump in my F22 228i",
    "content": "My windshield wiper pump just stopped working and only when I started to do some research did I see the warning about not using certain washer fluid solutions. Too late. Anyway, I bought a new pump and filter screen and watched the few videos online regarding how to access and replace a failed pump. Unfortunately, the few online videos  show the three series. It's a real blister and poster child for poor design because you need to remove the front passenger wheel and unscrew the wheel well protective panels first. The washer fluid tank that the pump is mounted in is tucked behind the forward body panel. I got that far, but unfortunately, there seems to be some differences in the placement and design in the F22 vs the three series models. The videos show the owners just removing one 10mm screw and tilting the reservoir forward to access the bad pump. Has anyone attempted this maneuver in the two series? It appears the base of the tank is anchored which is one difference and totally inaccessible, as far as I can see. It also seems to be attached at the top to the input feed where you add the fluid. Logically it would seem you need to unfasten that feed tube also before the tank would allow you to tilt it forward. I don't want to snap or crack the tank itself to create a whole new problem. I've seen ridiculous repair quotes online to fix something so simple on any other car and as many simple fixes it's just time and labor intensive if you're aware of the correct sequence and simple tricks. Any input would be greatly appreciated! I have a 2015 228i.\n\nWhat did you end up doing to fix the washer fluid pump? I tried to access the reservoir but not finding a solution (I have a M2 so the fitment should be similar to yours).\n\nIt's not rocket science just labor intensive. First you need to jack the car up. Then remove the front right tire, if I recall. Please double check the location on yours. Then you must remove that wheel well lining. Simple, just have the appropriate tools. Don't recall if it's Torx screws or Allen heads or ratchet heads.  but you'll see under there. There might be other threads noting the tools so you'll have them all before you start. The wiper fluid container is in a narrow reservoir wedged between the cars metal body. You slide that out and the fluid pump is a small plastic part located in the bottom of the reservoir. Then it's just unplug it, replace and reassemble. The pump was only a few dollars. Sorry I'm not giving exact instructions, just hopped in my car from a long plane ride. Again, it's a bozo engineering move to locate that assembly where they did but so be it. It takes some patience and labor but really wasn't technical or difficult. Hope that helps at least a little.",

I do not have that...it says oil level ok - regardless, I'm taking it to the dealer on Tuesday and do an oil change - piece of mind.\n\nI would only add oil if I were at Min or below it. There is an acceptable range for a reason. If you are between min and max, you have the correct amount in there to operate safely. Slightly too little oil is much better than too much. Fluids do not compress, and when you overfill bad enough, seals blow, engines blow, etc. Has to go somewhere. Stay between the lines!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bytranckTy!!! I do not have that...it says oil level ok - regardless, I'm taking it to the dealer on Tuesday and do an oil change - piece of mind.You should be able to get more detail, like the actual level, from that same menu if you select to measure it. \"OK\" is the un\"measured\" level.\n\nDo your M2's burn much oil? I'm 5K miles in and the oil level still measures at the 'max' line. I changed the oil and filter at 4K miles but even before then I don't remember needing to add much oil just to get her back to 'max'.This is my first BMW, and the first new car I've had in 15 years so I think I'm just used to older engines but I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.I don't baby the car either - in fact I just did my first autocross in her about a month ago and didn't need to add any oil. I'm used to my Acura which wants frequent top offs but she's 14 years old and has a 4 cylinder engine with an 8K redline.\n\nThe problem with the oil level display is that it does not tell you what the units are - it just shows max/min points.  Is the space between max and min a quart? a liter?My M2 was down about 20% between max and min after 5000 miles and, figuring that this was a quart, I added three ounces or 10%.  I was expecting the gauge to move halfway back to the max level.  But there was no change.  I didn't add any more to avoid the more serious overfilled condition.So I just gave up.  If the car needs oil, it will tell me.  It burns about %20 of (max-min) every 5000 so I just change the oil and live with it.I track the car and this drives me crazy.

It was a hassle, but totally solved my problem.\n\nThanks chaps.I'll have a look at disconnecting it myself.Thing is I filled the tank up how can I empty it short of pulling on the washer function the whole time?!Wonder if a silver kill coil would work. Used to be used in water cooled PC's but somewhat fell out of favour!\n\nI just let it all run out the bottom of the tank and tried to catch it, but that was messy. But its just water/alcohol so no big deal. Heres my more detailed notes for my e92.

Used to be used in water cooled PC's but somewhat fell out of favour!If you need to empty it you can syphon out easy with with a piece of hose. That syphon hose will also help you to break up and suck out the gunge as a start.To get the tank out is a faf, wheel of,  arch liner out etc.I just used hot water with household detergent and ran the pump continually with the line disconected under the hood so it doesn't block the nozzles, just spraying out over the driveway.. When it blocks, just blow back up the pipe end to break up the blockage and keep spraying. 2 or 3 tanks full it was clear but tank smelled of mould.Then i filled tank with water and bleach  left it over night then sprayed that out as above.Now every few refills i mix in a small cup of bleach, no more trouble.\n\nHow do I even get a tube in to Syphon? Mine has the weird textured black rubber part to reduce splashing a bit like a urinal?!Does that lift up?How does light even get in the engine bay for algae to grow?!\n\nI had some clear fliexible 8mm (maybe 6mm not sure) hose in the garage, i just pushed it in through the filler hole.Never tried taking the splash matt thing off.There's always light in there,  lots of gaps all over the place.\n\nCheers for that good ideas all round\n\nI'm told that any of the orange washer fluids will somehow interact with pump materials to gum things up with a kind of rubber sludge.  Specifically it is the silicon in RainX or similar products - apparently it is common enough issue that for both of my F-series they made a big deal out of warning about it and telling me if I clogged it b/c of that, they weren't going to fix it under warranty.Of course, if you are getting gobs of musty mold, that's more likely;  but if you have orange fluid and no moldy smell then you may need a new pump too, and pulling the reservoir will save you the time of trying the flush and refill.\n\nMost recent fluid is one made here in NZ. It's sold widely but no idea as to its quality. It just guarantees 'absolutely no webbing' !",

The fact that it's able to freeze the condensation to the point that no air is able to pass through indicates the gas is likely fine.  The fix that BMW published with the link above show they relocate the temperature sensor so that it can detect freezing.My problem is that you need specific circumstances to reproduce.  For me blasting through canyons in 105 degree weather seems to be the best way to experience the problem.  Exactly what I bought the car for.\n\nFrom the f30 forums and the TSB linked in my first post, I see they fit a temperature sensor spacer and flash a lower temp to the AC.  It's a $1.50 part and 15 minutes of work.  Does anyone know if the same part will work on a f87 that works on f30 and f80?\n\nThe problem is the gas, but if you have a lot of free time and you like to waste it, go ahead and mount sensors, spacers and more things.I dealt with this problem for almost 3 years, the problem was 250g. of gas, when it should have 560g.\n\nMy car is a 2021.

This is a 10mmx1.0mm pitch bleeder that is 31.35mm long overall.Anyone using these that can validate? I’d rather not pull a bleeder just to measure it.And BTW, I’ve used SBs for years and years, across lots of different cars, so don’t bother responding if your input is going to be something along the lines of “they leak!” or some other random fear-mongering that isn’t based in reality or producible documentation.Thanks!\n\nI took a chance and bought three 2-packs of Russell 639630 from Amazon. These are 10mm dia x 1mm thread pitch and 33mm overall length. The hex portion of the bleeder is a little taller than stock, and the overall length is a bit more, but the length under the hex is nearly identical. I reused the bleeder caps from the stock ones. They work great. Pics below.\n\nAny issues with these over time? I'm about to redo my calipers and want to pick up a set...

Work exactly as they should.If you have a Motive, Id not bother with Speed Bleeders though. Youd be using them pretty much the same way you would use regular bleeders (pump up the Motive, crack the bleeder open to purge and then tighten again). Stock bleeders are just fine for that.",

Wondering if anyone has some ideas/thoughts/suggestionsIt looks to me like all the oil is downwind from the drain plug. Checked and it was definitely tight. Wondering maybe if it's a bad rubber seal/crush washer.All this to say, really trying to figure out what best case/worst case scenarios are in order to effectively purchase this car.\n\nLooks like 6MT, not a DCT. There are no rubber seals or metal crush washers on the fill/drain plugs on these transmissions. Its just a metal plug to metal case seal.From the photos, it definitelylookslike the drain plug is leaking. Maybe the plug is damaged in some way and not sealing properly? The plugs are pretty inexpensive to replace:https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw...ug-23127602815\n\nIf the car doesn't make any noise, you can drain the oil and check how much it has, if it doesn't need much you can buy it, change the oil and put a new drain plug.Before draining the oil, clean the drain plug with a brake cleaner and take a good look at it, there are no cracks around the plug.\n\nThanks for the replies!Took a closer look and couldnt see any oil coming down the side, so dont think its the shaft seal. Its in with BMW now, we shall see what they say.\n\nThey feel pretty confident its just a bad transmission plug. 👍 Thanks for helping me diagnose!\n\nWell I drained the oil replaced the plugs and drove it for a few weeks.

I'm in need of front brake pads, I'll change only the fronts of I don't have to do both front and rears at the same time. Rears are pretty good on durability left.Changing the front pads once before having to change the rears is pretty common-- it has to do with weight distribution whilst braking; the rears just get used more as the car shifts weight forward.That being said, WHAT you replace them with matters.  I'm a fan of staying with the same compound for front and rear, but there is a case to be made where a dedicated front track pad (e.g. Ferodo 1.1/3.1) could be paired with a rear (e.g. Ferodo DS2500)-- but they're still running the same compounds, just different formulations of such.  And even then, I'd only do this for the track.As for track-- the DS2500 is recommended for *light* track duty.  I've used them and burned them up doing HPDE's, but I had a tune and was running a fair bit more power than stock.  After detune, the DS2500's were acceptable for HPDE, but I'd still consider them more of an \"aggressive street\" pad.R.\n\nFor road use really recommend ebc yellow stuff",

I had a friend who's experienced with manuals take it for a test drive and he said it was totally fine. Nevertheless, I still want to do something about this since it's a somewhat new car with under 30k miles. I feel like this shouldn't be happening.I'm interested in changing the transmission fluid with Redline DCTF (1.6L IIRC). I'm also considering doing the diff fluid with Redline 75W140 (not certain how much to use).Can anyone who's made this change tell me how it affected your car? I looked into the CDV delete + AA SSK but that doesn't really seem like it would fix the root problem here.edit: realized I put this in the S55 section, sorry.\n\nIs it possible the previous owner installed a ssk already? Also would you describe the shift action as resistant as opposed to notchy? Some indications of failed synchros would be resistance between gates as well as crunching and grinding.\n\nYour friend is probably right when he says it's totally fine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by(K)Is it possible the previous owner installed a ssk already? Also would you describe the shift action as resistant as opposed to notchy? Some indications of failed synchros would be resistance between gates as well as crunching and grinding.Everything is completely stock. The shift action has no resistance, the best way I would describe it is 3rd gear feels like there's a click when going from 2-3.3-2 can sometimes feel 'crunchy' where there's three or four of these clicks but still easy to get into gear and no noise unless I have the windows up and no music playing. There's no grinding sound from the transmission, only a grinding/notchy sensation when moving the shift knob into gear. I've also found that 1-2 is smooth when shifting in the 3-4k range and giving it an extra .5 seconds to let the synchros catch up.\n\nNo matter what, 1st to 2nd is never going to feel like butter. Due to gear ratio etc. I noticed the same 2-3rd (clunk) your talking about and I just got used to it over time but  theres nothing wrong with it. If you wanted to smooth that out you could do a ssk but I dont really think its worth it.\n\nA transmission fluid change, even as early as 30K miles, can make a noticeable difference.

I'm not sure it's outside of the normal range for these transmissions though. They just don't shift like a Miata.\n\nI'm thinking a fluid change at the very least should help. If you want to take it a step further then the Rogue Engineering transmission mounts may help even further.These transmissions tend to move around a bit so the transmission mounts should help to mitigate some movement. They're cheap enough (about $60) and easy to do.\n\n+1 to the comments above.Transmission fluid make a major improvement, even at 8,000km doing new stock fluid made a world of a difference. Like it was unreal how much better the car shifted. I have also heard nothing but good things about redline dctf so give it a try!Transmission mounts will help too, and if your gears aren't grinding you should be ok.In regards to diff oil only use the stock fluids, these diffs are sensitive to fluids so don't risk it, I would try to get MSP/A but likely you won't be able to find it unless you're in Europe or Australia, so get Saf-xj (NOT saf-xj + fm).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87source+1 to the comments above.Transmission fluid make a major improvement, even at 8,000km doing new stock fluid made a world of a difference.

Not as smooth or able to be as fast as I would like sometimes, but that's not how I would describe it.+1How I can describe it is:Knotchy is kind of a resistance, then a clunk/pop into gear.Crunchy is something entirely different, it feels hard to pull in all the way through the gate and when it finally engages it feels like there is a gritty sand/\"potato chip crunch\". That is not a good sign because your synchros are getting ground up.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87source+1How I can describe it is:Knotchy is kind of a resistance, then a clunk/pop into gear.Crunchy is something entirely different, it feels hard to pull in all the way through the gate and when it finally engages it feels like there is a gritty sand/\"potato chip crunch\". That is not a good sign because your synchros are getting ground up.Super easy to get into any gear. Almost no resistance at all. The best way I can describe it is the following:In second gear -> revving up ~5k -> moving the shifter forward and left (into neutral position) taking around 1 second -> pushing up into third with literally two fingers on the shifter -> third pops in easily but feels like there's some sand when it finally settles into gear.3-4 will feel similar as well, almost like there's some sand, and about 2-3 clicks or notches when pushing it into gear.Something I have noticed is all of my shifts are noticeably smoother on the downshifts (with Sport+ rev match).Oil arrived today, hoping to do it this weekend.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySS687Super easy to get into any gear.

Because forward and left from 2nd is reverse.Yeah that doesn't sound very good, that gritty sandy feeling might (but not guaranteed) be mechanical and that is never good. When was the last time you did fluid?But overall I would say try the fluid first and hopefully it helps alleviate these symptoms.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceFirst off I am assuming you mean forward and right to get into neutral from 2nd gear?

The trans fluid appears to have never been changed (only the diff oil according to carfax). I purchased this car around two weeks ago from a dealer. Underwent a PPI from a reputable indy shop and passed with flying colors. I changed the oil/filter + tires + battery within my first week of ownership. Nothing else has been done. At the time, the transmission felt great (either that or I didn't know what to look for since it was my third time driving manual ever).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySS687My apologies, long day.

According to the carfax, the car had a 'rear axel service' at 1k and the diff oil flushed at 27k (at a BMW dealer). I'll definitely post an update here once I change the trans fluid (as I'm confident it's never been changed before).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySS687In second gear -> revving up ~5k -> moving the shifter forward and left (into neutral position) taking around 1 second -> pushing up into third with literally two fingers on the shifterMay not be related to the issue but why taking as long as 1 second till the shifter reaches the neutral position?  Rev might drop too low after taking such a long time for a gear shift. Though rev match may fill the gap for you.In my case, stepping on the clutch, moving the shifter  and releasing the clutch pedal was in one motion. Rev  match is rarely activated.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySS687Thanks for the info.

If I can be very delicate with each movement and not push the shifter against the gate at any part of my shift, it results in the least amount of grind.",

    "title": "AGM Products, Jack Rod Review",
    "content": "Credit: F87SourceIntroduction:In this product review I will be taking an indepth look at the AGM products jack rod and all the benefits this incredibly ingenious tool offers. If you would like to buy this tool heres a link to do so:https://agatools.com/collections/jac...40756133527743Credit: AGA Toolshttps://agatools.com/I would also like to take the time to differentiate between AGA tools and AGM products, since both AGA tools and AGM products sell the patented jack rod. AGA tools owns ~50% of AGM, they share the same building and office space, and you can essentially think of AGA tools as the road car repair tools vendor (specializing in BMW repair tools) and AGM as the off road vehicle parts vendor. So in this review I will be looking at the AGM products labeled jack rod, but the AGA tools version is exactly the same with the exception being the label says AGA tools, and the box graphics are different (the box is exactly the same though).Disclaimer:Damage/Injury Disclaimer: Any information, guidance, technical advice, coding advice, tuning advice, datalogging advice, installation instruction, calculation, experiment, safety information, or product installation demonstrated in my reviews is to be consumed and or done at your own risk. I will not be responsible for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, or any damage to your car, or any property damage.Monetary disclaimer: I do not make commission, or profits or any kind of monetary gain from the sale of the Bootmod3 tuning software.Sponsorship disclaimer: The way my reviews work is that I determine what product that I want to buy and actually use on my own car, and during this process the product that I end up choosing is what I believe is the best option on the market. I then reach out to the company offering the product and ask them if they would be willing to sponsor me in a review, if the answer is yes then I write a review, if the answer is no I would end up buying the product (sometimes at a later date) but I would not make a large review about it. But the critical thing is that I reach out for a sponsorship and not the other way around, this means that the products I am reviewing are actually things I believe in and would use on my own car. This also means that I am not being paid to review something I do not care about. Would I do a review if a sponsor reached out to me? The answer would depend on if I believed in the product, and I would make it clear in my review if this were the case. But at the time of writing this review, such an interaction has not occurred yet.Time of writing disclaimer: everything I am writing about in this review is described at the time of writing and may not be updated in the future, so there is a potential things are no longer accurate  in my comparisons as parts are changed and upgraded as time passes.Bias and comparison disclaimer: Throughout this review I will attempt to be as unbiased as possible while drawing comparisons to other products.Image Credits:Images and videos used in this review are all property of their rightful owners as credited below each image, I am just using them for the purpose of this review but if you (the owner of the image) would like them removed please let me know via pm. Otherwise thanks to the respective image owners (I made sure to credit your online name and link where I found the photo) of the photos, without you this review would be so much more bland.Review Disclaimer:First and foremost I would like to thank the AGM Products for agreeing to sponsor me for this review. Despite this I will remain as unbiased as possible during the review. Please note, the dynamics of this relationship was that I reached out for a sponsorship review and not the other way around, this should demonstrate how I truly feel about the jack rod - in the sense that I truly believe it is an incredibly ingenious and useful tool, and would absolutely use it myself (in fact I am using it as I write this review, and I am using it to help me install some mud flaps - which I will be talking about in another review).Shipping, Customer Service, and Packaging:The first few things I would like to discuss is the shipping, Customer service, and packaging that I experienced when acquiring the jack rod.So customer service, customer service was very good, Kyle from AGM answered all of my questions promptly, was professional, courteous and extremely knowledgeable about the products I inquired upon (in this case the jack rod). When he didnt know the answer, he would contact the engineering department to get the answers for me - so props to Kyle for going above and beyond to help me. So overall customer service was great, no complaints here.Next shipping, the shipping experience was very good. I had the order placed around maybe 2PM PST (so later on in the afternoon) and despite this my order was packaged and shipped out via DHL on the same day, so order processing speed was absolutely astonishing (this can be very helpful if you need parts for your build ASAP). The package also reached me in less than a week despite it being shipped over the July 1st (Canada day) and July 4th (Independence day) long weekends and across the border into Canada.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourcePackaging was also excellent, the Jack rod itself was packaged in a cardboard box and surrounded in a foam insert perfectly cutout for the Jack Rod. This prevented the Jack Rod from being flung around during shipping and potentially damaged, so this was an excellent choice of packaging material. The other upside of this style of packaging is that the foam insert can be removed from the box and integrated into a tool cabinet allowing for a little insert to place your Jack Rod, or it can be used as a template for you to cut out your own section of foam for the Jack Rod to sit within.The shipping container was also high quality, it was a uline certified cardboard box (has a BMC certificate from ULINE) meaning it was tested for a specific weight tolerance and strength. Why does this matter? Well if your package is damaged the shipping company will often ask for the Boxs BMC to ensure it was a quality box designed to be able to handle the thing shipped inside of it, without a quality box your damage claim may be denied.Jack rod:Credit: F87SourceWhat is a Jack Rod? The Jack Rod is a compact spring loaded tool capable of turning your hydraulic floor jack into a replacement for the traditional jack stand and capable of holding anywhere from 2 Tons to 3.5 Tons! The Jack Rod works by slotting the lower cradle onto the front axle of your hydraulic floor jack (or for the 3 wheeled versions sitting right on top of the front wheel), you then press the handle and the jack rod extends the upper cradle onto the metal rod that supports the saddle of your floor jack. Next you release the pressure from the hydraulic jack and as the saddle lowers the jack rod will click into place and hold the hydraulic jack in a fixed position. Thats all there is to it, your hydraulic floor jack is now a jack stand! Gone are the days of constantly fiddling with the height of a jack stand and raising and lowering the jack to try and get it to fit, with the Jack Rod all you have to do is lower the jack and the Jack Rod will click into place - and this saves a massive amount of time.Heres a video from AGM showing it in action!3.5 Ton Jack rod:Next let's talk about the 1st variant of the Jack Rod, the updated 3.5 ton version - meant for 4 wheel jacks, and this is the version I have.Lets begin with some images:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceSo the 3.5 ton version is an update from the previous 2 ton Jack Rod because it adds an additional cross pin that increases its load capability to 3.5 tons. This cross pin is optional meaning you can use it with the cross pin to reach the 3.5 ton load rating, or without the cross pin to have a max load of 2 tons. I would also like to add that the main pin is locked into place (I believe due to friction) once the Jack Rod is loaded with weight, and this makes the handle near impossible to depress, so you dont have to worry about accidentally bumping the handle and unlocking the Jack Rod. Even with just my foot on the floor jack, or just the floor jacks built in leveling springs pulling the saddle down, I could not depress the handle on the Jack Rod and I tried quite hard to squeeze it. So accidentally bumping it will not cause the jack rod to collapse.Other than that the 3.5 ton is identical to the previous version with the exception that it has the additional cross pin to help it support additional weight.2 Ton jack rod:Credit: AGM Productshttps://agm-products.com/en-ca/products/jack-rod-standThe second variant of the Jack Rod is a specialized version with an enlarged lower cradle made specifically for the front wheel of the 3 wheeled floor jacks (2 rear wheels and one large cylindrical front wheel), this variant also lacks the cross pin and is limited to 2 Tons (which should exceed most if not all 3 wheeled floor jacks anyways, since these models are typically low load light weight aluminum jacks).Here is an image of the 3 wheel floor jacks that I am talking about:\\Credit: Canadian Tirehttps://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/m...1.html?loc=plpOther than that the 3 wheeled version of the Jack Rod functions identically to all the other versions (the new 3.5 Ton, and the original 2 Ton) and there are no other differences (minus the lack of cross pin) other than the larger bottom cradle to be able to support the large front wheel instead of a smaller axle.3.5 Ton Jack Rod Size and Specifications:In this next section I would like to go over the size and general specifications of the Jack Rod - because it is one of the biggest strengths of this product compared to a jack stand.First let's analyze a typical jack stand. I chose an Alibaba seller because they conveniently have a few models and their size and weights listed in a table, also because I'm sure a lot of the auto parts stores resell jacks sourced from similar manufacturers in China.Credit: Cangzhou Shengshi Weiye Automobile Accessory CO., LTDhttps://www.alibaba.com/product-deta...091612258.htmlIf we look at the specs of the 3 ton jack (to remain comparable to our 3.5 Ton Jack Rod) we can see that it has a minimum height of 285 mm, a max height of 426 mm, a base width of 180 mm (so the widest part of the jack stand), a cradle of 85 mm, and it weighs approximately 6.3 kg.Now let's compare this to our 3.5 ton Jack Rod:1) Weight:Credit: F87SourceThe Jack rod weighs in at 1.30 kg, so 5 kgs lighter than a typical 3 Ton Jack stand.2) Minimum length:Credit: F87SourceThe Jack Rod has a minimum length of *23.5 cm (technically a bit less because I measured to the top of the saddle), vs. 285 mm (28.5 cm and again its going to be a bit shorter because its also measured to the top of the saddle) of a typical 3 Ton jack stand. So the Jack Rod is 5 cm shorter than a typical jack stand.3) Maximum length:The Jack rod has a maximum length of 14 inches (35.56 cm) according to AGM products compared to 425 mm (42.5 cm of a typical 3 ton jack stand). So technically the jack stand has a ~7 cm taller reach, however you must factor in the height of the floor jack from the ground and the height of the saddle to the supporting rod and add that to the max length of the jack rod to get a true comparison.But the critical part here is that the Jack Rod has a bunch of height settings built into it, so essentially however high your floor jack can lift - the jack rod will be able to lock in at a height extremely close to that - and you dont have to raise and lower the jack to get it to lock in, all you have to do is slot the Jack Rod in and lower the jack and the Jack rod will automatically click into place. This is so much better than a jack stand, where you have to constantly fiddle with not only the height of the stand, but also you have to raise and lower the jack until you finally get it into a suitable spot for a jack stand to slot into a suitable spot under the car. So the result is you save a lot of time on lifting your car, meaning you can do whatever it is you need to do much faster.4) Width:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceThe Jack Rod has a width of ~4.9 cm at its shaft, ~6.3 cm at its saddle, ~2.4 cm depth at its center shaft, and ~8.4 cm at its widest point including the cross pin. While a typical 3 ton jack stand has a max width of 180 mm (18 cm) so the Jack Rod is at least ~10 cm narrower than the Jack stand.5) Saddle length:Credit: F87SourceThe Jack Rod has a saddle length of ~6.4 cm (keep this in mind when measuring your jack for fitment on the axle and saddle supporting rod), while the 3 ton jack stand typically has a saddle width of 85 mm (8.5 cm) so the jack stand has a wider saddle. This shouldnt matter at all because the true saddle width for the jack rod is whatever your floor jack has.So in summary: the jack rod is lighter, shorter, and narrower than a typical 3 ton jack stand - and by significant margins. This all means that it will be so much easier to store the jack rod: in a cabinet, in your cars trunk (or even under the trunk liner near the battery) or glove box or in a door pocket - which is extremely important for track day guys who also carry tires and tools in addition to a jack and likely will not have room for a bulky jack stand, and even on the jack handle itself via the jack rod mount (you can buy it here:https://agatools.com/products/jack-r...43500779405553)Credit: AGM Productshttps://agm-products.com/cdn/shop/pr...g?v=1686183531Applications and Benefits:Now that we know what a Jack Rod is and the 2 different models, let's talk about some applications and benefits for this incredible product!1) Jack stand replacement: Modern day BMWs like the M2 dont have many spots for jack stands - especially at the front of the car.Credit: SflBimmer8484https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...8&postcount=34If you look at the underbody of the m2 besides the 4 jacking points there really arent many good spots for jack stands. There are no exposed frame rails so you dont have easy access to those areas for jack stands, and putting a jack stand on the covered underbody is a major no go as you risk puncturing the sheet metal floor. Putting a jack stand on the suspension components is also a bad idea because you risk damaging the bushings in these components (as they are not meant to take the weight of the car, as the majority of the cars weight is on the strut towers) or throwing off suspension alignment. You cant put a jack stand on the differential of M cars since they have fins for cooling. The only spots you have left are the rear subframe and the front center jack point (which is impossible to reach without crawling under the car and is a small flat circular object that is not suitable for standard saddle jack stands). This means once you have a jack under one of the 4 jack points, your selection of spots for a jack stand is extremely limited and this makes it difficult to find a spot for your Jack Stand.With the Jack Rod this is not an issue because any jacking point is not only the spot for lifting with a jack, but also the spot for your Jack Rod to act as a jack stand.2) Ultra portable jack stand for the track: The jack rod is incredibly portable as discussed in the aforementioned section, this makes it perfect for track day guys who have limited room in their cars due to the tools and tires they are carrying. So no longer do you have to decide whether or not you should leave something behind to bring a jack stand or not. This means track guys no longer have to risk their safety by changing tires using a jack alone - it also makes jacking up an entire side of a car a lot safer:Credit: INDhttps://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=11668873) Non-intrusive: The jack rod slots right into your floor jack, this means it doesnt take up any additional room under your car while youre working - vs. a jack + jack stand combo which will take up additional space. For example if you place a jack stand under the rear subframe on these BMWs access to the rear differential for fluid flushes becomes extremely hampered. If you somehow got a jack stand on the front jack point (maybe with a flat top jack stand), then oil changes become extremely hampered and you might not be able to put a drain pan there.Hydraulic Jack:Before I show the Jack Rod in action I would like to quickly go over my 4 wheel hydraulic floor jack so you know what I am using. This section will also come in handy later on when I analyze the front axles carrying capacity and the safety of the Jack Rod.So I have a basic 2 ton power fist (princess autos in house brand) low profile hydraulic Jack.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceThis is a really generic Chinese made floor jack that I am sure is relabeled for all sorts of other vendors, for example a near identical one is sold under the moto master moncre for Canadian tire:Credit: Canadian Tirehttps://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/m...q=floor%20jackI have also seen this exact same frame being used on various lifting capacity jacks from 2 ton to 3 ton (the moto master one, and previous power fist ones I saw in store) to 4 ton (big read has an identical frame:https://www.amazon.ca/AT84007R-Hydra.../dp/B0897XRCPM). So I am fairly certain these jacks all have the exact same frame (also because it is fairly uncommon for a 2 ton jack to have this kind of frame, they are normally the super small compact ones or a 3 wheel version) but just different hydraulics to allow for them to lift more weight - again this will come into play soon when I analyze the safety of the Jack Rod.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceFurthermore my jack has a front axle length (between the frame mounts where the Jack Rod would slot in) of 13 cm, and a saddle support rod length of 7.5 cm. So this is more than ample for the Jack Rod.And this is what my jack looks like with the Jack Rod in place:Credit: F87SourceActual Usage:Now on to some images of the Jack Rod actually being used, here are 2 images of the Jack Rod on my SUV - the reason why it is on my suv instead of my m2 is because the ground clearance allowed me to more easily take images.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceStrength concerns:Now the final section of my review, and the major concerns with the Jack Rod - and this is how strong is the front axle of your floor Jack and can it handle these kinds of loads? Because if it cant, then the jack rod isnt safe.To answer these questions I did a lot of mini pseudo science experiments - in that I did not have any controls, I did not have any test samples, etc. All I did was a small test to see on my own jack so I could see if the concerns out there were pressing or not.First here is a video showing the construction of the Jack Rod, and the quality of design and manufacturing the goes into this product to ensure that it is high quality and safe:Now onto the analysis of the Jacks axle strength. The first bit of evidence I saw in regards to testing these jacks was from AGM themselves (1:00 min mark of this video):The result was that the axle didn't even start to bend until 4 tons was applied to the jack, which was double the jacks load rating. So this is a really good sign that these axles are strong enough to handle the entire weight rating of the jack and then some - and technically the front axle isnt supposed to be bearing the weight of the entire load by itself, the rear wheels are supposed to take some weight as well.Next my own testing - I will be using electronic calipers and an electronic hand scale, all measurements were taken multiple times and the measurement I saw the most or a median measurement was taken.Now some more measurements:Credit: F87SourceThe axle on my jack is 18.42 mm, knowing this - I wanted to see what the diameter of the rod supporting the saddle was. Because if it is similar in size or smaller then it should in principle be able to support aleast the same amount of weight - meaning if the axle is safe then the saddle rod is safe too.The saddle has 2 rods to support it, a front and back one and the saddle can pivot and slide around freely on these two rods so they can both experience similar amounts of weight as the load shifts around.Here is the rod where the Jack Rod sits:Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceThis rod has a diameter of 14.65 mm, so it is actually smaller than the front axle.Here is the rear rod:Credit: F87SourceThis rod is approximately 12.57 mm so a bit smaller than the front rod.This means the axle is going to be stronger than the saddle rod, but since the saddle rod is shorter it is less likely to bend, and if the front of the saddle is pushed up the rear of the saddle will go down putting load on the rear saddle rod so some load will be transferred there too. So factoring in the shorter length of the saddle rod and there being some weight transfer, imo the saddle rod is likely not the weak point - it will be the front axle.Now onto the testing, in my test I will be putting a weight on the jack in its highest lifting state (to push the weight as far backwards as possible). This will show the minimum amount of weight transfer the front axle sees, and from there we can calculate the percentage of weight the front axle sees. This will let us calculate a safe percentage of weight the front axle can hold via multiplying the percentage of weight the front axle sees from the jacks weight rating.Ok now some more measurements:Credit: F87SourceThe weight I used was 1.74 kgCredit: F87SourceThe weight of the front end of my jack lifted so the wheels are just off the ground is 4.90 kg.Credit: F87SourceThe weight of the front end of my jack lifted so the wheels are just off the ground with the 1.74 kg weight on the saddle in the highest position is 6.05 kgThis means that of the 1.74 kg weight, the front axle sees 1.15 kg (loaded weight - unloaded weight). This is 66.09% of the 1.74 kg weight being transferred to the front axle - which I thought was weird since I thought the large majority of the weight should be on the rear of the jack. But after multiple measurements this was the approximate results that I got, and I attribute this to be the cambered design of the jack frame putting more load on the front. Now note, this number should increase even more if the saddle wasnt lifted as high so this percentage should only be a minimum safety measurement. So a 2 ton jack can hold 4,000 lbs, and 66.09% of 4,000 lbs is 2,643.68 lbs, and this is more than any corner weight of a BMW ever could be (especially the m2). So imo (if my calculations are correct) it is safe to say that this Jack Rod on my 2 ton jack, can be used safely on any BMW. It can also hold half the weight of almost every BMW and still be within its safety range if we take my calculations seriously.Overall my personal conclusion based on this highly unscientific experiment is that the jack rod is safe to use - when calculated based on percent weight transfer of the front axle multiplied by the jacks weight rating. But based on actual testing by AGM the front axle and the saddle rod is much stronger - to the extent where a 2 ton jacks front axle and saddle rod can hold double its rated weight. This leads me to believe that the hydraulics is what limits the floor jack - not its frame. So again I would personally believe that Jack Rod is safe to use, and am currently using it to install my mud flaps and change the oil on the SUV without fear.Summary:Overall the Jack Rod is a small, portable replacement for the jack stand - and is a great tool to have in your collection! Thank you once again to the AGM team for sponsoring me in this review, I absolutely love your gaming changing product!\n\nReserved for future posts.\n\nThese are one of my favorite tools. I purchased mine when they first came out.Good to see they've updated the design and packaging since they were first released. I've distributed over 20 of them from a group buy I set up and those all came in plain boxes with no padding. It's nice they've also modified the saddles to support the 3-wheel jacks per my feedback.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFaRKle!These are one of my favorite tools.

Thanks for posting, OP.I'd feel comfortable with the load ratings and knowing that the jack won't collapse if the hydraulics were to fail, but what about the fact that the jack is still on wheels, vs. the rigid feet of a jack stand? It may be unlikely, but the jack could still roll, causing the car to fall. Is that addressed at all?Otherwise, this could be a solid extra layer of security even just for changing wheels, pads, etc.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymssVT98This is really interesting, I hadn't seen this tool before.

I've tested by pushing on the car quite hard and it wouldn't budge an inch. But for extra security I just chocked the jack wheels as well (I have rubber door stops that I cut down to fit the jack), and that pretty much solves that problem.\n\nI love my Jack Rod, here is my review.

I was hoping to get some advice RE: a few fault codes that have surfaced during an inspection of a 2021 M2C.I'm in the market for an M2C, a nice example (2021, HS) came up recently at a local BMW dealership. I organised a pre-purchase inspection, and everything checked out really well except for some fault codes that came up during the diagnostic scan. The codes were:138102 - Exhaust flap, activation: short circuit to ground138A02 - Exhaust flap 2, activation: short circuit to groundS0219 - Communication not possible with amplifierS0222 - Communication not possible with active sound designI've asked to the dealership to investigate + fix these. They claim that there is no issue with the amp or sound system, but the codes will remain present for the life of the car. They are also still investigating the exhaust flap codes.I don't know much about the technical side BMWs, particularly not on a car this modern, so wanted to get some advice here. What could these codes mean? Could they indicate more severe issues? Should they stop me from purchasing an otherwise good car? Any feedback or further information would be great!Thank you in advance,\n\n\"the codes will remain present for the life of the car\" is complete BS.\"S\" codes are not real codes from the car. They come up when ISTA adds them in due to various reasons. In this case those S codes are meaningless. You can simply do another scan that talks to those modules. It may be that the previous owner added an active sound design canceling harness.The other codes for exhaust will come up when there's an aftermarket exhaust or simply the exhaust flaps are disconnected (to force them open). It doesn't trigger a check engine light because it's not too serious of a code. It's really easy to determine if the exhaust flaps are disconnected.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byEnabled\"S\" codes are not real codes from the car.

Could you elaborate on this part? I'm not quite sure I understand.I plan on bringing an OBD Adapter and BimmerLink when I inspect the car myself in person. So I'll use those to make sure the dealer has fixed everything.In either case, it doesn't seem like any of these codes indicates any serious issues?",

I have a spreadsheet of my own Ive been maintaining, but its much simpler. I think Ill transfer my stats over to the one you shared. Thanks!\n\nOh my bad, I just changed access to it.\n\nMany people enjoy maintaining their car, and rationalize extra maintenance over the factory schedule. I used to be one of those people, then kids ate up a lot of my time and money so I only do what I think  actually needs to be done.My car sees 5-8 track days a year, as well as daily driving in summer and winter. I do the following:Oil change at 3k miles because of track use, otherwise I do 5k on all my past and current turbo BMWs. Engine air filter at 15k. Diff and trans are perfectly fine for 50k/5years on street driving. I probably will follow this with track driving too. 30k is fine for plugs with street driving. Id say 50-60k is a good idea for the water pump, coolant, and overflow hose. I’ve had BMWs long enough to have all this crap happen to me on different cars lol. But I wouldn’t change the coolant just by itself, just wait till you proactively or reactively replace something else. I don’t know much about the “mickey mouse” thing so can’t offer much guidance.Belts and pulleys, just replace when the bearing starts making noise. This is more of a wear out failure. Same with the OFHG, just replace it when you notice some weepage. As for the charge pipe, you are due already! My factory pipe blew at like 20k miles under warranty! I’ll be doing mine in the next 12 months (at 33k right now).Regarding coolant, you could also try out some test strips. I’ve never used them though. Check out the Nissan GTR owners manual for some interesting stuff on car setup and maintenance! They don’t skimp! Gotta change your rubber brake lines every 5 years!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byE90convertMany people enjoy maintaining their car, and rationalize extra maintenance over the factory schedule. I used to be one of those people, then kids ate up a lot of my time and money so I only do what I think  actually needs to be done.Yes, Id like to find that sweet spot of just enough maintenance to preserve the car well for the long term.Quote:Originally Posted byE90convertEngine air filter at 15k.If Im reading the owners manual correctly, it recommends every 10K miles. Do you read it differently?Quote:Originally Posted byE90convertDiff and trans are perfectly fine for 50k/5years on street driving.I noticed a difference with new manual transmission fluid at 30K miles. It felt like more than placebo effect to me.I was planning on waiting for the recommended 50K miles for the diff, but the car (I assume the CBS system?) notified me via the My BMW app to change it at around 30K. So Im assuming itll notify me similarly in another 30K?Quote:Originally Posted byE90convertI dont know much about the mickey mouse thing so cant offer much guidance.Ive only read about it failing due to it being a plastic part. What Im less sure about is low long it might last.

My factory pipe blew at like 20k miles under warranty! Ill be doing mine in the next 12 months (at 33k right now).Im a bit afraid of this one stranding me and my family somewhere. The car isnt tuned  and wont be  so Im hopeful I have some time. Im trying to figure out whether to go with a metal pipe (and whether thatll cause me problems with the car inspection here in CA) or whether to just preemptively replace with an OEM plastic pipe every 30K miles.Quote:Originally Posted byE90convertRegarding coolant, you could also try out some test strips. Ive never used them though.What would I be testing the coolant for?\n\nFor the air filter, it’s 30k or 3 years in the maintenance manual. I change it at 15k because I don’t want it restricting as it gets dirtier. For the transmission, it was probably because it has been 5 years, not based on the 30k mileage. I would change out the diff too. I don’t think there is any harm in waiting beyond 5 years though. It doesn’t get hot enough to degrade the oil significantly, and you’re not tracking it so contamination build up is less. I’d change it though, low cost and takes very little time. Honestly it could probably be a “long term” fill without track use. Perhaps a powder coated black charge pipe would go unnoticed, or finding a CARB compliant one.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byE90convertFor the air filter, its 30k or 3 years in the maintenance manual. I change it at 15k because I dont want it restricting as it gets dirtier.The owners manual maintenance schedule definitely confuses me. Its less straightforward than the maintenance schedules for Japanese vehicles that Ive owned  probably because its a matrix that tries to include all sorts of BMW models and not just my M2.And yes, now I see that it calls for every 30K miles for the engine air filter. Thanks for pointing that out!Quote:Originally Posted byE90convertPerhaps a powder coated black charge pipe would go unnoticed, or finding a CARB compliant one.Yes, thanks! Im strongly leaning in this direction. I just have to convince myself that itll pass visual inspection without being flagged. A powder-coated black one will probably sail right through.\n\nI originally had the coolant interval at two years. According toF87source, thats twice as often as needed:https://www.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...php?p=30253836So Ive changed coolant interval in the first post to every four years.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjefe2000I intend to DIY most of the maintenance on my 2018 LCI M2 with an N55 engine and manual transmission.

And, for some of the items that dont need as much attention as the spreadsheet suggests (like an alignment every two years), its easy to hide rows.As a side note for anyone else that starts using this spreadsheet: I had to input a row for each maintenance item that represented when the car was brand new. This was the only I could find to set a start date for all the maintenance items. Otherwise, all the maintenance tasks that havent yet been done  like fuel filter or brake rotors  appeared as overdue because their default/initial last maintenance date showed up as sometime in the 1800s. So I entered a row for each maintenance item with the date when the car was built as a way to seed the start date for each one.",

I heard some are not necessary, but I rather keep things running as smooth as possible, being better safe than sorry.As for how often I plan to use these products:I will use the Molygen oil change kit every 5,000 miles with Pro-Line engine flushJectron fuel injection cleaner, fuel cleaner system cleaner, and valve clean every 3,000 milesSpeed Tec gasoline additive after every 3-5 full tanks of gas used, 3,000 miles minimum (filled with 7 gallons of fuel left in system)If you guys have any suggestions / recommendations, please let me know !Thanks, Shane\n\nupdate: CERA TEC not needed for Molygen oil\n\nNo, and HELL NO!You don't need additives in oil. Oil already has carefully balanced additives. And if you are really that obsessed with health of your engine, use better oils. Liqui Moly is average at best product.No additives for gas. Gas already has enough additives!Good oil, Costco gas, and hit the road!\n\nDon't use any of that garbage. Switch to either Motul or PP oil, change it every 5k, and call it a day.\n\nYou guys beat me to it lol. I was gonna write that's all garbage and a huge money waste.If you want, I always run fuel system cleaner (the bmw stuff is chevron techron, but now they might have changed it so the small concentrated bottles might not be techron anymore) right before an oil change since I run ethanol based fuels and I want to ensure there isn't any gum or deposit build up.\n\nI was wondering what he might be doing to his engine that he needed to add that much Snake Oil?I suppose using gas that's a blend of varnish and sulphur - as it was cheap - might make some of it necessary...\n\nI wonder if it is safe to use engine flush?

As there is oil cooler, what will the remaining oil flush do to the engine?No do not use engine flush.The left over oil in the loop is inevitable, hence why you should always let your car cool down before shutting it off (don't drive it hard before you know you're going to park and let it idle for a min or two before shutting it off) so the oil doesn't coke up from being in hot engine components like the turbo, and why you should do frequent oil changes. Because you don't want high mileage oil left over in the loop, but low mileage used oil will be fine since it would only be a fraction of the fresh oil you put in (I think the oil cooler loop holds 1-2 L of oil most likely ~1.3L).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceNo do not use engine flush.The left over oil in the loop is inevitable, hence why you should always let your car cool down before shutting it off (don't drive it hard before you know you're going to park and let it idle for a min or two before shutting it off) so the oil doesn't coke up from being in hot engine components like the turbo, and why you should do frequent oil changes.

So honestly pick the oil that is cheapest and easiest to get in your area and don't look back. Me personally I sue pennzoil, I know that quakerstate in the USA is dirt cheap at walmart so that's a good option. Castrol is probably dirt cheap at walmart too, motul probably not.\n\nSoF87sourceis in Canada and doesn't have access to some oils as we do and as cheap as we do.First of all, take into consideration that BMW updated LL01 and LL04 specifications in 2018. BMW outright banned 0WXX oils in those approvals as they tend to either have more \"true\" synthetics and those cheaper ones have a lot of polymers. That means they will oxidize more (tru synthetics) or shear more (polymers).However, that was done to boost OCI in B generation engines. So it doesn't affect N/S55 engines.You can use 0W30 or 0W40 oils with confidence in M2 and they are cheap here.How they stack against other oils? IMO Castrol Edge 0W30 (expensive on Amazon) and 0W40 (thicker brother of 0W30, super cheap in Wal mart) are best oils for BMW engines. From UOA I have seen they just like that oil. They are tru synthetics and have extremely low pour point and very healthy HTHS.Now reason why all oils are not same is that approvals set up minimum requirements. True, those are stringent requirements, but there are good and REALLY good oils and then REALLY good oils but not quite right for certain applications.So I will give you 3 examples:Castrol Edge 5W40 is mediocre representative of Edge family. NOTHING special, basically bare minimum Castrol is getting away with. Liqui Moly products are in this category.Castrol 0W30 and 0W40 are top of the line Castrol products. Especially 0W30. That was only oil I am aware that had for quite some time Porsche A40 approval but was 30 grade. Porsche later made some tweaks to approvals that eliminated this Castrol. It is darling of Euro enthusiasts since beginning of 2000's. Castrol Edge 0W40 is thicker brother of 0W30. I use it on track in my N52. Exceptional results.Now third oil is Mobil1 0W40FS. Track capable oil like Castrol 0W40. Lots of ZDDP, and gentlemen's set of base stocks. But SAPS level (sulfated ash and phosphorus) is ridiculously high. If you had port injection engine like I do, no worries. But DI engines really don't like a lot of SAPS as SAPS is what carbon build up is made of. So excellent oil, just not for your application.Now approved LL01 oils! Which one? As F87 mentioned Pennzoil Platinum Euro 5W40 is very good choice mostly bcs. GTL base stock, high HTHS, low Noack wtc. Very low Zinc so not as best option on track but best option to save timing chain guides in N20 as guides don't like Zinc.Motul X-Cess 5W40 GEN2 is another very sophisticated oil. Great HTHS, good amount of ZDDP. But IMO, both of these are just notch below Castrol Edge 0W30/40 and Mobil1 0W40.Now F87 and I discussed this a lot. He is in Canada and these 0WXX oils are fairly expensive, not readily available.Here is my UOA of Castrol Edge 0W40 that has 47 laps at High Plains Raceway. To the righ is previous analysis of Castrol Edge 0W30 I used in winter months. No track. As you can see 0W40 did better although it was used on track. This UOA is as good as it gets.So hopefully you have enough info. Ask if you need more information.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolSo hopefully you have enough info.

    "title": "Which Jack To Buy",
    "content": "I need a jack to get my lowered M2C on 4 jack stands. I would like to use the front center jack point. It's 33\" in from the front so the entire jack would need to slide under and my CF front lip is 3.75\" off the ground. The race ramps with the correct degree are only 3\" tall. That would put me at 6.75\". Low profile long reach jacks all look too tall in the frame/pivot area around 7.5\".I currently don't have a jack and would prefer to only buy 1 jack and 4 stands.Anyone have any recommendations?Also looking at the ESCO stands, do you need the BMW jack pad adapter with the ESCO's or can you drop the car onto the rubber pads at the jack points?Thanks\n\nQuickJack Lift + Esco Jack stands for 100% convenience, future proofing and safety is what you need, youll thank me later (and yes it works in lowered cars, Im on Bilsteins). With the QJ, I have all the space I would ever need underneath, oil changes, exhaust work, suspension changes, rims or brakes jobs are a breeze.Esco jack stands are great, but I would still use the BMW jack adapter pads.  I use them as a safety add-on causePics tell the story\n\nIf you don't want to spend a lot for the quickjack system (which is obviously great), this may work (credit: other bmw forum)http://www.omegalift.com/ProductDeta...ack/29023B/763\n\nIf youre going to be jacking it up a lot the quickjack is worth the money. If not, grab a low profile jack from harbor freight. It still wont fit all the way under without first jacking up the sides to put a small piece of wood under each tire in the front, but that takes all of 60 seconds.\n\nAny low profile jack will work if you use the right strategy.For lifting the front, I'll jack up one side using the REAR jack pad on either side, then place a jack stand on the front pad on that side.  That gives clearance to move the jack to the center jack point under the engine, which you can then place a jack stand on the opposite side and the front is secured.For the rear, I use the black cross bar (part of sub frame) behind the rear diff.  That will get you high enough to place jack stands on the rear lift pads.I would recommend the Esco stands, LOW PROFILE version.  And at least 2 BMW pad adapters.\n\nI actually just purchased a 2-ton Daytona aluminum floor Jack from harbor freight and two jackstands from rennstands. https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?store-page=Rennstand-Each-1-Piece-p252276669IMO its a really good way to lift the car using the existing plastic jack points. I was also able to use this setup on my x5 and didnt have any issues when changing the brakes.",

All the threads coming up on bimmerpost are like 3-4 year old so I thought I'd ask again.Can I use any 0W30 oil thats BMW LL-0 certified? I read on the other threads Motul was good but it will take few days to ship from Amazon for me.Are there any good oils you guys would recommend I can buy (at any of the mainstream stores) for time being to top off my car until my next oil change?\n\nThere are probably a number of quality synthetic oils that can be used, but for a new car under warranty why bother?  Just stop the the dealership and pick up a liter.  Heck, if you want to wait a few minutes, the dealer will top it off for free.You can also order it from Amazon - if you have Prime, you'll get it by Friday.\n\nThe Manual says BMW Longlife-01 FE, and 0W30.  Since its hard to find Motul Oil, I'd go with a Mobil 1 or Castrol Edge 0W30, or just go to the BMW dealer.  And while you are there ask which brand they use when they do oil changes.\n\nThe dealers use to use Shell.  I understand that they have switched back to Castrol.  You need an LL-01 approved synthetic oil.\n\nThe dealers use BMW-branded oil (at least for newer cars/under warranty), probably made by Shell given their agreement with BMW.  One (internet) reference I saw said it was made by General Oil Company.I don't have a bottle to look at the back to see if it states who makes it.

Sent it back to the dealer two times to get it checked up and also raised up the issue to the customer service in Germany. What Ive been told is that the noise came from the compressor, and BMW has decided not to fix it for me because BMW Germany claimed that it is how the M2 is, just like rotor shield vibrating thing. Is this for real? Anyone else had the same problem and got it repaired under warranty?Some of my local M2 had experienced the same noise but they just ignored it. I mean the noise is not a big deal but quite annoying when I am cruising and want some quiet time alone.Here is the short clip I recorded to explain the noise.\n\nHey,Did you ever solve it?

Combinations with other vehicles are not required, it's just for the M2.I would suggest looking at the list that Bimmercode supports, they all seems of high quality. And since they work with the BC app, they serve dual purpose.\n\nThe MHD F series wifi obd2 adapter is the best one available that bimmercode supports. It is able to fully utilize the bmw flexray system and has insane flashing rates. For example the vgate i car pro bluetooth adapter was recomended by bimmercode and that took ~30 seconds to load some of the modules in bimmercode, the mhd adapter loads those same modules in under 1 second, same goes with flashing.Also the mhd adapter has an ethernet jack so you can also use it with ISTA and ESYS, therefore you can get two devices for the price of one (ENET cable and wireless obd2 adapter). This pretty much justifies its high price tag.\n\nI had a veepeak, now I have the MHD and it's so great, really fast.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceThe MHD F series wifi obd2 adapter is the best one available that bimmercode supports.Also the mhd adapter has an ethernet jack so you can also use it with ISTA and ESYS, therefore you can get two devices for the price of one (ENET cable and wireless obd2 adapter).

Is it only for tuning/ mapping? Can you go resetting service codes, fault codes etc... Is there a database with the error/ service codes?Any other recommendations others please feel free to input their features for other users in the future.It can also function as a regular wifi adapter for things like bimmercode.Yes you can reset codes via MHD.The generic obd2 codes are pretty much crap for BMWs, they don't tell too much about the car. That's where ISTA comes in as it is factory BMW software that they use at the dealer to diagnose cars. It can read codes, clear errors, run through diagnostics etc. You can use this in conjunction with the mhd WiFi adapter and Ethernet cable. Just be careful when using it so you don't screw up the car.\n\nIf you happen to want Bootmod3 in the future, it might be worth just investing in an E-Net cable, and a Ethernet to Lightning port adapter so you can connect it directly to your iPhone. To my knowledge Bootmod3 currently only works off a wired connection.The downside is that it's a wired connection, so a little more \"hassle\" when it comes to coding / flashing the vehicle, but it allows you to do the flashing / coding significantly faster and will work on almost all the available apps and tuning platforms available. The MHD adapter is just as fast when it comes to the wired setup, however it's a pricey module. The upside to this setup is that it offers the same advantage of the MHD wireless adapter, but at a cheaper price point.Either way you can't go wrong! Just providing another alternative.\n\nI have both the enet cable and setups for the E series BMW and F series. But if you just want to clear codes and run scans, nothing beats the convenience of an ELM adapter and Torque Pro from the app store. Used it on all my BMWs without issue. Most important it provides accurate and specific code description. Personally I haven't had an issue with speed or latency.https://www.amazon.com/Veepeak-Bluet...3781337&sr=8-4\n\nI use the Veepeak to do some work with Bimmercode but yesterday I was trying to connect it with TrackAddict and it wasn't reliable.

Anyone experienced the same? And will the WiFi MHD version be better?Mhd WiFi is amazing, loading modules takes under 1 second or 3 at Max whereas the I car pro takes up to a min. Flashing takes about 1 second while it takes 15 seconds + for the vgate I car pro. The mhd WiFi adapter is stupid fast.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDalmangoAny recommendations for a high-end OBD scanner to reset service intervals & fault codes.

This is what I found out about my vgate I car pro, which was $30.So that would be a quality issue. If you buy for example the obd link lx or mx generic obd2 adapter, then yeah it'll be pretty good.\n\nFantastic input guys, many thanks, right it seems that MHD is well thought of & larry.beck many thanks for sharing your experiences with Veepak; this is the exact feedback I'm after.Right I'm looking at the MHD so far unless anyone else comes up with something else quite impressive. I'm not too worried about loading times, so long as it's under 10 mins or so. I'm only using it to service my own car; not in a professional capacity.Thanks again people, I got some great input here & am most grateful.\n\nISTA + used laptop + lead (or wifi dongles if you insist) = everything that BMW can do for you for less than they would charge for a single diagnostic.As you're only looking to service your own car, the longevity of the physical components when subjected to daily use is less of an issue.Edited to reflect feedback from F87Source.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyINPA + used laptop + lead (or wifi dongles if you insist) = everything that BMW can do for you for less than they would charge for a single diagnostic.As you're only looking to service your own car, the longevity of the physical components when subjected to daily use is less of an issue.Not trying to be a douche but you're incorrect, INPA is for older E series bmws.

I know the brake pads have not been replaced since first owner, so the mileage doesn't seem realisticAny pointers would be helpful, thank you!\n\nThese checks and services have been done by the dealership (for instance, they have serviced/changed the brake fluid, so it now shows the 2-year period to the next service interval).Im sure the BMW dealership will provide the service history if you request a print out.Sounds like they have serviced all outstanding items.  Is the car CPO?  If so, they may have changed brake pads, etc.  its a rigorous program.Good luck and enjoy the car!\n\nBrake fluid due at 3 years from build date so that's normal.

Because as the battery gets older the car progressively charges it less and less in accordance to the progressively declining capacity of the battery. This is how the smart charging system works, however when you replace the battery you must recode the car otherwise the car will think that the battery is old and will not charge it to its peak capacity. Thus you will under charge the new battery and cause issues.2) Do you have any accessories like dash cameras or anything like that plugged into the car? That could cause battery drain over time. Especially things plugged into the obd2 port or into the fuse box or battery directly, because these things may not turn off when the car is off.3) Do you have any abilities to scan the car? There are cheap apps out there like bimmer link that allow you to have a very good diagnostic scanning, and the app is cheap so it really is a nice little tool to have for any bmw owner.\n\nF87source, hiThanks, in answer :1. A dealer fit so I will have a record somewhere, I think about 18m ago. Understand the battery point, sat next to the M2 is a GT3 that is used much less and has a smaller battery.2.

If the dealer installed the battery it should have been coded correctly, so no worries there.2. Interesting so there is nothing to potentially cause drain there. I don't have anything off the top of my head that would explain your situation, so you'll likely need to scan the car for codes.3.https://www.bimmerlink.app/This is the link, you will need a wireless obd2 adapter though (you can get something cheap like the vgate icar bluetooth adapters), but this will let you scan the car for any error codes.

They forgot to take it out when I purchased new.  Guess they installed them on their vehicles before they sold them in case someone stole it?  Kept draining my battery if I let it sit for a while.  It was in my truck and had some extra wires coming off the battery directly.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCarrera2RSThanks, I drove it on another longer journey over the weekend (40 miles or so each way) and it didnt do it for the first time, so perhaps it is intermittent. I'll take a picture when it does it again. It spoke about discharge and restart and drive, but I did do another 70mile trip before and no change with these messagesMy '17 with a new battery (as of one year ago) complains when there are shorter drives in the colder months.

If you have collected your M2C, can you confirm if the car came with Lithium battery as the M5 does?I find the information useful, one of the page mentioned the 24V EPS in the previous model, the large capacity battery can eliminate the need of DCDC, a 2nd battery and therefore 90lbs weight savingsounds like a no brainer, I will be angry with BMW if they don't come std in all M models.Thx.\n\nThe  M2C does not come with an Li battery like the M3/M4 do;if it had it would drop about 30lbs of weight.  It would also result in a $1500  battery at replacement time.  It's not a direct swap as that link shows; plus I'm guessing the charging system would provide the wrong input cycle and voltage for an Li battery.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCSBM5The  M2C does not come with an Li battery like the M3/M4 do;if it had it would drop about 30lbs of weight.

That’s exactly what I was looking for. I’ve got 2 vehicles (car and Moto) with Antigravity batteries in them already, but hadn’t yet seen this.For weight savings, I’m planning the battery, exhaust and wheels (763M already installed). That should be ~100lbs. I have kids, so no rear seat delete for me. After that, it gets pretty expensive (Carbon Hood-Trunk-Roof, AP Brakes, Seats).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byBill in MarinAfter that, it gets pretty expensive (Carbon Hood-Trunk-Roof, AP Brakes, Seats).That's why you have to work your way backwards. Start with the $32,000 Brembo Carbon brakes to shave ~50lbs. Then the $5400 carbon fenders to lose 7lbs. Then the more you buy, the more sense it will make to be buying it. And the better you'll feel about it. You'll be feeling FANTASTIC once you remove the rear seat for FREE and lose ~60lbs. lol\n\nDid you end up getting the battery?

With age being the only factor when you replace a battery with one of the same kind. So when you register a new battery, it is resetting the algorithm it's using to charge the battery. I'm not particularly sure this is a good idea to do if you're replacing your battery with a used one.\"The negative battery cable has an electronic control unit on the battery end of it called an intelligent battery sensor (IBS). The IBS measures the state of battery charge and sends this information to the ECU. The ECU uses this information to control how much charging voltage is needed from the alternator to support vehicle electricity needs. A battery deteriorates normally over time and depending upon service demands and driving profile. The IBS reads this and the ECU tells the charging system to increase voltage and amperage output incrementally as the battery matures. Therefore, at battery replacement time, if you don't tell the ECU it has a new battery it will overcharge the new battery causing it to wear out faster.The registration process takes place in the ECU, which is the main player in this system. Also, when the IBS sees that battery voltage is too low for normal vehicle operation it can start shutting down vehicle functions to conserve power while keeping the vehicle operational. This would be accompanied by a check control warning of excessive battery discharge.”https://www.1addicts.com/forums/show....php?t=1338304\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAnthony1sQuote:Originally Posted byPoochieActual, anytime the battery is replace with a neworused unit, it needs to be registered to tell the IBS to adjust to the proper charge cycle.Well \"need\" is a strong word. \"recommended\" and \"potentially optimal\", I think would be more accurate.My dumbass friend believed the same as you and didn't bothering registering his new, OEM battery he installed because he didn't want to spend the extra $50.Within a year, the battery was dead, I mean completely.So it's one thing to make armchair assumptions about whether or not you \"need\" to register the replacement battery but it's completely different to witness it before your eyes.BTW, his new battery, after the one that died, which was registered the second time around, lasted 4 years going into 5.It's your car and money, so do whatever helps you sleep better at night but factually, if you don't register the replacement battery, it will die prematurely.Just some friendly advice based on personal experience.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPoochieMy dumbass friend believed the same as you and didn't bothering registering his new, OEM battery he installed because he didn't want to spend the extra $50.Within a year, the battery was dead, I mean completely.So it's one thing to make armchair assumptions about whether or not you \"need\" to register the replacement battery but it's completely different to witness it before your eyes.BTW, his new battery, after the one that died, which was registered the second time around, lasted 4 years going into 5.It's your car and money, so do whatever helps you sleep better at night but factually, if you don't register the replacement battery, it will die prematurely.Just some friendly advice based on personal experience.Well no, you're not stating facts.

Seems to me that the dealership may be stretching the interpretation of the third oil change coming w/ spark plug replacements to possibly generate revenue. Anyone else had their spark plugs changed at such low mileage?I believe that the US maintenance warranty is 36 months. My car had the break-in oil change and 3 more. The last 4th oil change at 36 months included brake line flush, engine oil change and new spark plugs. I didn't think at 20k miles it would need plugs but after the change the idle was smoother with no misses.\n\nYep, my plugs were changed at the third oil change, around 15,500 miles.  I asked my SA about it, and he told me it is BMW policy to change plugs every third oil change, at least on these engines.  As long as BMW was paying for it, I had no problem letting them.  I really doubt I will be replacing them every third change on my dime, since I am currently only driving about 3000 miles a year.\n\nI'd run far and fast from that stealership. Oil changes are called for at 1200, 10k, 20k, and 30k while you are under the free 3/36 maintenance. Spark plugs are called for at 30k. Saying that the 1200-mile service counted as \"1 oil change of 3 included\" is just wrong, and most likely the SA knows it, but that's their own business practice to lie to the customer and then do crap like change the spark plugs early, because BMW will pay for it once.Changing the plugs at 8600 miles is a complete waste of time, money, and parts. If my dealership tries any such nonsense, I'll be complaining to BMW corporate.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevinCI'd run far and fast from that stealership.

If my dealership tries any such nonsense, I'll be complaining to BMW corporate.My spark plugs were changes after three years.  That technically was during the fourth oil change.  After the breakin oil change my oil has been changed once a year due to oil age not mileage (under 10K miles per year).\n\nKevinC- It would have made more sense if I was on my third annual service as similar todavidkand DanG I don't hit 10k miles before annual service is due. Just thought it was weird and wanted to see if people are having similar experiences. I certainly echo davidk's sentiments in that I would not be replacing spark plugs at such low mileage on my own dime.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's your first service or your 20th - plugs don't care about time, they care about how many times they're fired, i.e. MILEAGE. These stealerships are just grabbing money when BMW allows it. Shameful. And a head-scratcher as to why BMW allows it.\n\nAt 8,600 miles in that long a time - unless they were track miles - they're probably fouled.So, you 'could' have them changed. Or you could take it for a several hundred mile drive at sustained high rpm and - in addition to having fun - \"service\" your plugs...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevinCIt doesn't matter if it's your first service or your 20th - plugs don't care about time, they care about how many times they're fired, i.e. MILEAGE.

The longer a plug sits, it may gradually \"corrode\" to the head which makes removal less than fun\n\nWhats the average price for a plug change?\n\nI had the same thing …3rd oil change , only had 12100kms and they did the plugs .\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMaximus_M2Whats the average price for a plug change?I don't know what dealerships are charging as I only use them for covered services.

Pretty sure even the BMW brand oils thus far have not had this and their engines haven't changed and have been doing great on the LL01LL01FE i wouldn't bother.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevM2Do you know what it's NOACK score is? Couldn't find it anywhereI'd say that there really isn't any good info aside from forums on the actual NOACK of the Motul X-Cess.  I do know that my Subaru EJ257 drank a lot less X-Cess over the M1 0w-40 and the X-Cess is cheaper than PP Euro 5w-40.  So really I think this is a situation of just choose whatever is easiest to obtain.\n\nPennzoil platinum euro 5w40 is only a little more than $6/qt on Amazon right now, after coupon and rebate.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevM2So from my research thus far this is a short list of what I would consider the best oils for our cars:1. Motul 300v 5w402. Motul x-cess/Xmax/sport 5w403. Total Quartz 9000 energy 5w404. Redline 5w305. LiquiMoly 5w40 Leichtlauf High TechThe order of these can be debated as can some of the weights.  What oil do you use?Total Quartz and LiquiMoly have been the go-to oils for M motors for ages.  Maybe not the most popular on the forums but a very common choice among specialists/mechanics. Not sure about Redline or Motul.. seem to be more popular in the domestic crowd but these oils really are not that different. Are you changing it every 5,000km? Then it isn't really that big a deal. Any quality synthetic will be fine. I'll probably run 0W40 if I'm near winter or 5W40 in summer.\n\nThanks for your input.  Yes I will be changing it every 5000.  I guess it doesn't really matter but I just want an oil with the lowest volatility possible while it meets the LL01 rating since under warranty.  For my first oil change after break in, lll probably use Redline 5w30 since it's thinner but still at the upper range of 30 in terms of viscosity and it has higher ZDDP for more protection.  But for my subsequent oil changes I will likely go with Pennzoil Euro 5W40 (summer driven only).I'll be sending all my oil changes to Blackstone so I'll post the analysis.\n\nso ive got some Castrol edge bottles at home to do the intermittent oil changes its a 'Titanium fst, 5w-30 A3/B4.. is this suitable for not losing warranty?",

Made a world of difference and for the good, too.You can maybe find an app for your phone or just search out stations along your route that carry 91 and fill up sooner rather than drive until the tank is bone dry and hope you can pull into a station with 91.As others have mentioned Boostane is a good octane booster. At the Boostane web site you can find a chart that will tell you how much of what flavor of Boostane you need to add to XX octane of gasoline to get it to 91 or whatever level of octane you want.Depending upon how successful you are at finding stations with a suitable grade of octane available you might need a case of the stuff.Car owners who have used Boostane report deposits (orange which I think is MMT?) but the deposits don't seem to affect the engine.While on the road it might be a good idea to use Chevron Supreme (91) with Techron which might remove the deposits.\n\nI would steer clear of additives, I used them for only a short period maybe a few weeks and when I took my downpipes off my entire turbo and cat was covered in thick neon orange residue. Not good\n\nAs a follow-up.  We took our trip from Lincoln, NE to Palm Springs, CA and back (3,700mi.) without incident and without the need for any octane booster.  Even when crossing long desolate areas of the desert and way up the mountains we were still able to find suitable 91 Octane fuel.  I appreciate all the great feedback from everyone.",

    "title": "Dealership Wrecked/Damaged M2C During Scheduled Maintenance",
    "content": "Yup, you read that right.Took the M2C into the dealer for scheduled maintenance today, and the dealership damaged it significantly. I drive a 2020 M2C, with less than 10k miles on the odometer, I've had it in my ownership for less than 2k miles (actually purchased the car from another forum member). The car was scheduled for brake fluid, oil change, spark plugs, and cabin filter. I also asked them to take a look at the rear taillight as I was receiving intermittent alerts saying there was a taillight malfunction.Not sure why it took them 4-5 hours (I had an appointment at 9:30am) to do a fluid change amongst other things, that should be fairly quick/simple, but they finally got back to me around 2:30 PM and informed me that my car was damaged. Their excuse was that the \"tech was avoiding a car that was swerving into him, and so he tried to avoid it and instead hit the curb\". I really wish I had a dashcam because I don't buy any of it.So far, the damage looks to be the front bumper, front lip, and both passenger side wheels. Pics below. This literally happened today (a mere few hours ago) and I am absolutely livid, speechless, and sick to my stomach. There really is no excuse for that car to have gone off the lot for a few fluid changes. I tried to get the exact location of where it happened, but the service director could only point me to the general area. I decided to walk up to the area (about 3-4 blocks away) and noticed quite a bit of skid marks on the road - though I can't be certain that was from my car or not. Sadly, I have no proof that their story pans out, but I firmly believe the tech took it out for a joy ride.The service director apologized and stated that they would obviously repair the damage. I told him that this is obviously going to hurt the resale value, etc., and they replied that they can do everything in-house and no need to get insurance involved. I haven't decided which course of action I will take yet, but I will at least email them here shortly to ensure I'm documenting everything (e.g. - making sure they are admitting fault, etc.).Would love everyone's recommendations on how to proceed forward with this.. I'm so angry at the moment.Not sure if I need to get a lawyer involved. I want them to repair the damage + more for all of the troubles. Not only do I want them to fix everything that they damaged (including alignment), I want them to upgrade me to 763m wheels, replacement of my aftermarket carbon lip and side skirts to OEM carbon parts, new tires, and reimbursement for cost of PPF on the front bumper and lip.I was scheduled to take this car out to the track next month and was really looking forward to it.. but looks like that will have to wait.Pics below:\n\nSickening. Honestly, Id ask for brand new wheels, bumper, splitter, have the tires checked out to make sure theyre ok and ask for lifetime alignments. If theres any chassis damage, youll know pretty soon.Guaranteed it was a joy ride mishap not a typical evading a lane drifter event, in my opinion. Im so sorry this happened to you.\n\nOne thing to consider is to have it repaired at your own shop of choice. I'm not sure who they use, but I would only take it to a certified collission center.\n\nWow I would equally be livid. You definitely have every right to be.For what it's worth I just did that same service on my 2020 with 16k and I do have a dashcam. The tech drove it, I assume to make sure plugs were running correctly. He didn't get on it hard or anything though.Hell I'd make them foot the bill for a dashcam install 😂\n\nEven if an insurance claim is not filed, the shop may automatically report the incident/repair to Carfax. Which, to be honest, is only right. The next buyer ought to know that this happened.It sucks. Maybe the dealership is willing to guarantee value - ie well honor excellent quality KBB for trade in. Youd need that in writing, I suppose.Ive had situations where the shop caused minor damage that they repaired and I traded in shortly afterwards and the dealership gave me a big discount on my next purchase along with KBB for trade. Something to think about. Id figure out someway to offset the diminished value on the car.\n\nIt honestly looks more to me like what might happen if you're fucking around on your phone and veer into the curb accidentally. But if you saw skid marks perhaps they are being honest. Not sure if that lip is oem, but they absolutely should replace your lip, repair your bumper, replace your wheels, and fix any other damage 100% on the house. They should also offer you free alignments going forward, a guarantee on the work they perform to repair it, and perhaps a gifted ultimate care plan if you dont have one. I doubt you can get 763's out of them, but they should use oem carbon to replace what you had imo. They should redo the ppf for you too.\n\nDamn, this hurts to see.. I am sorry you have to deal with this man hopefully it gets fixed without anymore headaches\n\nI got my car back after the 1200mile breakin service with 9 extra miles.  They told me that they needed to test it after the service.  BULLSHIT!\n\nWow.Get a list of everything that is damaged.Looks like- wheel- front bumper- front spoiler- tire looks weird so replace tooGet everything new, painted, mounted etc. Also ask for loaner during repair and $500 for compensation for your time and hassle.Get them to agree in writing, email is fine.  No need for a lawyer as long as they agree, which they will, and that will just water down what you get as he don't work for free.\n\nWow I'm so sorry this happened to you. I'd be fuming as well. Good luck.\n\nThanks all for the advice. Like some of you mentioned, one of my biggest concerns will be with the damage unseen - mostly on suspension/alignment. I am currently exchanging emails with the dealership, and I have in writing that they are at fault and will repair the car accordingly. However, we've yet to discuss exactly what will be done, in addition to what they will do to make this right. It's hard to put a price on the inconvenience, the headache, and the hassle I am about to go through.Verbally, dealership stated they will replace the wheels with new ones and they will not refinish them. My main concern is what they will do with the bumper. While I'd prefer for them to replace the entire bumper, I'm afraid of how well they will be able to paint match it, especially with the PPF on the surrounding front clip. I will also ensure they somehow replace or reimburse me for the PPF and ceramic coat on the bumper + lip.\n\nDamn sorry to hear man. Double check, but I would make a claim through the dealer's insurance and make a \"diminished value\" claim as well.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygoprophamThanks all for the advice.

You don’t want bondo on the edge of the bumper like that.I would personally have the car thoroughly checked out at a BMW certified collision center. Curbing the wheels at speed is absolute murder on the suspension components. If there is damage to the control arms, then it’s time to start thinking about the frame. I doubt it’s that bad - I would expect the tires to have popped in that scenario.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byWakkaHell I'd make them foot the bill for a dashcam install 😂And if they are like \"many\" BMW dealers, company policy is to unplug dash cams while in for service (anecdotally based on bimmerpost threads on the subject).\n\nSo sorry to see this.Brings back some PTSD.  After my M5 was taken for a joy ride (based on mileage in/out, no damage) I started explicitly stating to the SA that I didn't want any of my cars driven unless I was contacted.  I even left a post-it note on the steering wheel with the mileage (maybe that was a dick move, but it worked).  We added a new Z4M coupe to our garage in 2007.  In 2009, it was due for routine service and my wife dropped it off without my usual precautions.  I get a call saying the wheel was curbed and they would be replacing it.  Okay. Great, things happen, and the dealer is making it right.  However, it stretched into a week (waiting for the wheel, etc.). I pick up the car and it is pulling a bit to the right.  I garage it, inspect the front of the car and can tell it had been repainted, with overspray at that.  Words can not express how I felt, but you obviously can empathize.  The dealer finally admitted the car had been taken for a joyride, the tech and lost control and slid into a curb.  The dealer fired the tech (I didn't ask them to do this).  They attempted to make things right by repainting the car, and giving me stuff, etc. but it never seemed right to me.  Thankfully, this was only car we ever leased because at the time BMW couldn't sell these and the lease deals were so incredibly good.  I had planned to buy it after the lease, but turned it back in.  Of course by this time it was 2010 and Z4M coupes were no longer in production.  It took me almost a year to find my current Z4MC, a one-owner car with 8K miles.  I guess all is well that ends well, but it was a painful experience.Assuming the suspension is okay, you are in reasonable shape in terms of resale because a new splitter and new wheels/tires are obviously not a big deal.  These days, repainting the plastic bumper covers should not affect the resale value assuming the work is of the highest quality (not the case if a panel was involved).None of this eases the pain, of course.  You'll get new wheels, new tires and a new splitter.  Make sure the paint job is done by the best paint shop in your area.  I'm sure you can convince them to throw on a few extras as you suggest.GL and I hope this all works our for you.\n\nI would try to get them to upgrade you to a CS on them. Ok bad joke because this is a nightmare and you have the right to be extremely frustrated and mad, specially since you just had the car for such short time. Hopefully the car is ok but I bet it is, we definitely get super picky about our cars here and start thinking that there could be hidden damage but there is a larger chance there isn't. I don't feel good about the \"we won't report the fixing\" because I think that is a scumbag thing to do, the next owner will buy the car and have a clean car fax and maybe later find out the bumper is not original or it looks repainted, ect... I would definitely ask for a new bumper and just make sure the paint matches (its hard to see sometimes when there is not a lot of light, take the car outside and check from every angle). Absolutely get all new carbon parts and they should be OEM, new damaged wheels as well. I would probably get the PPF done at a good place instead of letting them decide since you want a good PPF shop and who knows who they will use to try to save some money. As far as the 763M, you could certainly try, doubt they will go for it but could be some compensation for your troubles (and its not even enough compensation).Good luck, I do think you will get the car back and will look good and you will have time to enjoy it. Does suck that you will probably have to skip a track day because those are the best days but more will come, summer still young.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMooMooM2I would try to get them to upgrade you to a CS on them.

Maybe even seek their guidance on how to proceed.If the dealer pulls any shenanigans during the process, BMW NA will step in to make things right.\n\nMan, this is an M2 owners worst nightmare.  We dont have the most expensive BMWs, but boy do we have the most coveted BMW out there.  My F10 got totalled a couple of weeks ago, and I've been looking for a replacement for it, and given the car market I had to go to all my local DC area dealers over a span of a few days.  And EACH AND EVERY TIME, there was a bunch of dealer sales or tech guys hovering around my car admiring it.  Every dealer asked if I wanted to sell my M2 \"for a ton of money\".  It is truly a car that everyone wishes they drove.Similar to you, I too witnessed a young tech driving my M2 fast around the parking lot of the dealership after the service.  I called it out and reported to the service manager.  No need to be driving it so fast. I'm gonna DM you OP as we are in the same city and I'm curious as to which dealer this is\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMavussucks man! that's why I go to my indy cause I don't trust stealership aholes.I'd want car on the lift and full inspection of suspension and body parts with images to get the total damage assessment, parts & labor.As soon as the warranty ends I will be doing everything at the indie and even then I want to get some suspension work done and will get it done at the indie to start building the relationship\n\nOP, very sorry to see this happen to you. I honestly would not be able to live with it. Impacts to the wheels are bad. All the suspension components and bushings have likely been tweaked. Albeit very little, but certainly more than road miles can produce. Also the rear diff is a sensitive component, impacts from the side are the worst.There will likely be many that think this mentality is over the top, but if it were my car it would bother me forever.\n\nIf I got the car back and it looked good and if I drove it and it drove well I would sleep well at night. I need my car to be a fun thing and not a stressful thing. When mice got inside my car I had a couple of stressful days thinking about it and the damage that they might have done or will do but at the end of the day its just a car, not going to stress about it, enjoy it and eventually sell it. But the repair has to be done properly, no half ass crap where you can feel it drives wonky or the paint does not match. It will be fine OP",

Has kind of a shoosh/whoosh aspect to the noise, not a distinct tick.A mechanic's stethoscope can be used to pinpoint the source of the noise. From under the valve cover almost certainly valve train related but don't rule out an injector.Might add my experience over the years is engines get noisier as the oil accumulates miles. This is normal.Even so it is quite remarkable to when after changing the engine oil and to fire up the engine -- with the engine hot -- and letting the engine idle while I clean up how much quieter the engine is. And because I changed the oil with engine up to temperature the new oil heats up quickly so it is not just the oil being \"cold\" that makes the noise difference.Not suggesting you throw some super high viscosity oil in the engine. My advice is to use the oil the factory calls for. But an oil change -- if the oil has some miles on it -- might quiet the engine. By \"miles\" my SOP was to change the oil every 5K miles. So if the oil has close to 5K miles maybe an oil change might help. But if the oil has fewer miles, <4K, probably not.Not a fan of oil additives, but some techs I knew advised me to use Swepco 502 oil additive. I had a sample analyzed. It contain 200ppm of molybdenum. They told me they recommended this to owners of cars who didn't use the car every day but were bothered by the valve clatter on engine start after the engine had sat unused for some time.My car engines at the time required 2 bottles of the stuff because of the amount of oil (approx. 9 quarts) they held. Understand the engines were not excessively noisy to begin with. Nor did I let either car sit more than a day or two between use.  I was just curious.I tried some and it seemed to help, seemed to reduce engine noise a bit.When I sold those cars and bought new ones I didn't continue to use Swepco additive because the factory cautioned against using any oil (or gasoline) additive. Also, the new car engines were not noisy beyond the usual engine clatter level.",

Stock suspension, no mods.  I've heard it now and then since just a thousand miles or so, and while surprising each time, it doesn't manifest in any noticeable change of feel or physical sensation at all.  Sounds to me like a spring squirming on its perch perhaps, though it's often when turning but not under much squat or intense throttle/handling.  I'd be surprised if that could happen on such a modern car.   Any ideas?\n\nAny updates on this? I'm hearing a clunking sound sometimes going over pretty big bumps on what seems to be both front wheels. Driving straight or turned. 6,500 miles 2018.\n\nBumping my old thread here to see if anyone else has had a creaky front suspension and what they did? Mine creaks from the front passenger side when going over bumps in a straight line (can really hear it at low speed) and when hitting small bumps while the wheel is turned left. It goes away when turning right and it doesn't happy when you turn the wheel back and forth while stopped.I do have KW V3 coilovers but it made the exact same noise when on stock suspension so it's something unrelated to the actual shock/spring, but it has progressively gotten louder and seems worse when it's hot outside. First noticed it with maybe 1500 miles on the car, currently have ~7500.In retrospect, I should have taken it in for BMW to look at before installing the KWs since they will just blame the coils, and I don't have the energy to redo the whole install x 2 right now. I plan on taking everything off about 6 months before warranty expires and having all these little things looked over before re-installing them but was wondering if you guys had any thoughts right now?Thanks!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypruettfanAfter spending the last 9 weeks driving these crappy Houston roads I am surprised anyone can tolerate an M2 on these streets.

Let us know if you figure yours out and I'll do the same!I just realized you're the one who made the giant KW v3 install guide. So you probably replaced the bolts I listed when you installed your coilovers.Quick update from me. My DP arrived damaged, so I have to wait a bit longer to proceed with my suspension noise ideas. Back when I had my KW's and sway bars installed, my mechanic and I went through and replaced every bolt he took out. I was kinda hoping we missed the bolts I mentioned above, but so far that doesn't seem to be the case. Because my mechanic gave me back all of the \"not reused\" bolts from the install and they match the stiffening plate bolts I got in the mail Friday. I have 12 in my bag, which is 8 stiffening plate bolts and 4 rear suspension brace bolts. So seems to me they were replaced during the install. Either way, they have to get replaced again with the downpipe install, so it's not like I bought them for no reason.Once I get the carrier bolts and top hat bolts in the mail, I'll compare them to them to my bag of \"not reused\" bolts and see if they were replaced already too.\n\nMy 2017 M2 LCI had front right suspension clunk when going over humps or driveway entry at low speed, thing is it doesn't always happen so I didn't bother to look into it and later sold the car..\n\nI want to add my recent experience in case it's helpful to anyone...I took delivery of a 2020 M2 Comp in August.  Right away I noticed a significant metallic ping, creak, or tick sound coming from the front suspension.  It would happen when entering my driveway or articulating the front suspension but also when turning the steering wheel while maneuvering into a parking spot.  It was not a repeating rotational noise associated with the front wheels turning or related to applying the brakes.  It sounded like something was loose or shifting whenever a load was applied.They checked out the calipers and tried the shim fix between the hub and disc.  The dealer eventually diagnosed it as a problem on the upper front strut.  They ordered new guide supports and washers (basically the upper mounting of the strut where it bolts to the frame) and replaced both driver and passenger side parts.It appears to have fixed the problem so far...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byGoneIn4Secsdoes this occur on the M perf suspension too?I have squeaky rear M perf suspension.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyI have squeaky rear M perf suspension.Do you fixed it?

    "content": "Helloi want to change all liquida (oil)  in my M2 LCI.  Few days ago i allready bought an oil for another car, but now i dont need it.Try to check if this oil is suitable for the M2 gearbox but i only found the origine Part number for oil, no specifications. I bought this oil:https://www.ravenol.de/de/produkt/ge...vsg-sae-75w-90Ravenol VSG 75W90 SAEIs it Ok or need i another oil?Best regards Christian\n\nI think the original gearbox oil is GL-4 rated and 75W80 weight. So, no.Why do you need to change it?\n\nI do this with all my cars. BMW says its a lifetime fill. When the gearbox is broken, lifetime is over.Oil manufactors like castrol give their sealed products a best before time around five years. Every oil aiging, even when it is used, the additives wear also. The oil in my M2 is know five years old and around 50tkm in use. So its a good time to change it, also the diff again. Next change again five years or at 100tkm.The best example.for a very fast wear of additives: My daily Bimmer E90 has a very sticky gearbox. Often first gear wont step in in first try. Changes the oil, it was a bitt better. Then fill in two portion of Liqui Moly gearbox additive. It was amazing, the first time it was like having a brand new gearbox and was very happy. But lasts only 500km (city traffic), then slowly start to get sticky again.So, i guess its a good idea to change it time to time.\n\nCheck your clutch hydraulics. If there's air in the system the clutch won't fully disengage and give you the symptoms you describe.Hope this helps\n\nGearbox oil is mtf -lt5 spec'ed which is a low viscosity dct fluid, hence why the gear box oils that carry mtf-lt5 specs are oils like redline dct, motul multi dctf. So I would use one of those oils, but I did hear some very very good things about redline's dctf so I would pick that one.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyCheck your clutch hydraulics. If there's air in the system the clutch won't fully disengage and give you the symptoms you describe.Thanks tonyour advisr. Bit it a known issue of the E90 gearbox. I bleed Clutch sereval times,  removed CDV, get Clutchstop. Clutch is fine, its really the gearbox.F87sourceThanks, will take a look to this oil.\n\nAs you can see I've had 3 M2's, and always have used the factory spec'd oil by Pentosin:https://www.bimmerworld.com/Fluids/D...uid-Liter.html\n\nI just go to the Redline oils site and use what they suggest.\n\nThat very interesting. I checked different german premium manufactors, and no one offers oil for M2 gearbox.And in US market it seams no problem to get a compatible oil. 75W80 GL4 rated oil is available in Germany, but they dont give offficial specs as a replacement.I will handback the not needed 75W90 and buy a SAE 75W-80 GL-4 oil.\n\nNot sure about 75-90 or 80. Bmw uses 75W-140 in the F87 M2\n\nThat's the diff oil, the gear box doesn't have a specific weight rating right on the package.I think the OEM is pentosin so I'll check what pentosin says the weight is.\n\nWell, as per my earlier post, several suppliers say it's 75W80.An example:https://www.bimmerworld.com/Fluids/D...d-1-Liter.htmlThe actual MTF-LT5 does appear to come with only a 2-year warrantee interestingly...\n\nA few days ago I changed the oil in my 6MT, Motul DCTF together with the ultimate shifter.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byProdrive_XA few days ago I changed the oil in my 6MT, Motul DCTF together with the ultimate shifter.I guess it's hard to compare since you changed the shifter also, but any improvement from the fluid?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byProdrive_XA few days ago I changed the oil in my 6MT, Motul DCTF together with the ultimate shifter.Nice!I heard motul dctf is a decent fluid, but I also heard redline was even better.

So technically redline has better quality base stocks, but the major factor that influenced why I think it's better is the testimony from the m2 owners saying it was night and day vs. stock fluid and even fresh stock fluid. So I too will go redline likely next year. But note with heavy Pao and ester oils they oxidize easier so you'll have to lower your fluid change interval.But good to know the motul is good, I might do that instead of redline if the redline oxidizes too quickly. I'd prefer to do changes ever 3 or 4 years (since I don't drive enough for mileage to be a limiting factor) so if it can't last at least 3 years that might be a problem for me.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceQuote:Originally Posted byProdrive_XThe car has 28,000km i change the fluid to see what state the old one came out in, it came out a little grayish but nothing worrying, and also before the first gear was difficult to enter, now all the gears are very fine, I'm sure the redline is much better , in the next change I will try itYeah redline is Pao and ester based, while the motul is synthetic base which likely means some group 3's in there.

But note with heavy Pao and ester oils they oxidize easier so you'll have to lower your fluid change interval.But good to know the motul is good, I might do that instead of redline if the redline oxidizes too quickly. I'd prefer to do changes ever 3 or 4 years (since I don't drive enough for mileage to be a limiting factor) so if it can't last at least 3 years that might be a problem for me.Check HPL.

This is the same as every BMW I've ever owned. 2xE36, 2xE46, 1xE82, 1xE84, 1xF87. It's as easy as it gets.As far as the drain plug there is no bottom panel in the way of the drain plug. It's right there in plain sight. All of my other BMWs have either had it in plain sight or at worst required a plastic trap door to be opened that did not require any tools. The M2 is far and away the easiest oil change of any BMW or other car I've owned assuming of course that you put it up on ramps as it sits fairly low. One exception. The front spoiler sits very low so putting up on ramps requires that your ramps be long enough.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPackPride85I don't plan on waiting until 10k for the free change.

As a normal daily driver the BMW oil is sufficient but if you start tracking the car it's advisable to look into higher protective alternatives.\n\nHey I hear you on your request, research and your final solution. Am in St.Louis area, and frankly get oil service done at my dealer over here, and yes I guess I could save some on it. Love to do it, but I have no desire to lug oil in a container to a repository place...no matter how close. Did that in Chicago area for years on all out Brit cars...and those days are done. I also have some strong relationships with dealer, the techs, am allowed to interact and for the extra money I spend it HAS paid off at times where there was some small issue at stake. BUT using stock oil and filter is just fine..and as above if you are not tracking the car, or abusing it as a prat might, then stock is fine for your sitiuation...and mine now for that matter. Road America is no longer on the agenda. Cheers...",

No issues since.But if it returns out of warranty I just plan to code out the bulb check using Bimmercode. I tested this for a bit before having my right side replaced and it worked without issue.But also hoping that if it fails again it's within 2 years since there is a two year warranty on parts.\n\nI wouldn't stress over this. Since this issue was already covered under warranty before and has come up again while still under warranty you are covered. The dealer should also cover it if it happens again outside of warranty as a good will repair, especially since it's a safety issue. If they don't talk to a manager, go to another dealership or call BMW NA and express your frustration.\n\nGot service done today.  They found 106 turn signal malfunctions.

Corrosion or just condensation?  Bad seal?Hi, sorry I didn't reply earlier, I didn't check the mentions.I did not see condensation/corrotion/burnts/rustiness. It happened during summer (wet area near the sea). I opened, cleaned all the contacts properly with circuit cleaner and so far, no issues.Mine is an LCI, if it helps\n\nI'm at the dealer currently having my '19 M2C rear lights replaced due to the malfunction, and my service advisor just told me that BMW extended the warranty on the rear units to 10 years. I'll see if I can get a screenshot of the notice he was reading later, but for those of you out of warranty it might be worth a try to check with your dealer.Update: I just took a look at the service note and it doesn't actually say the tail light assembly warranty has been extended, but instead just mentions the taillight assembly side mounting tabs. So unlikely the entire assembly warranty has been extended.\n\nSo you get a message in the cluster when this happens right?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byGoneIn4SecsSo you get a message in the cluster when this happens right?Yes a message appears on the dash.  The signal also does a quick flash.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byGoneIn4SecsSo you get a message in the cluster when this happens right?Correct. In addition the malfunction is stored in the computer so the dealer could just scan the car to see that the problem occurred. In my case, they found that the malfunction has been occurring for the past year on both the right and left sides, so they replaced both tail lights.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDanGI see that the  administrators closed my old right turn signal malfunction thread.So I guess I need to start a new one.Two years after I thought my dealer had fix this problem, I just started to get the dreaded right turn signal malfunction message.I go to the dealer in a little over a week.  I guess we will see what they do this time.  Good timing though.  My warranty is up at the end of this month.can you provide a link to the old thread?  I just bought a used M2 and would like to learn more about this issue.Quote:Originally Posted byDanGYes a message appears on the dash.The signal also does a quick flash.It did happen for me once when I signaled, that the flasher was quick, like there was a burned out bulb, but when I tried the signal again, it was normal.I'd like to read that thread for more info.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJackhammer909can you provide a link to the old thread?

I believe it is 83222365988.I always recommend sticking with OEM fluids for the diff because they are so finnicky. So MSP/A if you can get it - I believe Europe still uses MSP/A (I think Canada is switching to SAF-XJ now), or SAF-XJ (remember it has to be exactly SAF - XJ, not SAF - XJ + FM as the FM is additional friciton modifiers and meant for the E9x m3 and will blow your F8x E diff).The reason why I didn't buy Castrol syntrax limited slip gear oil was because it is also compatible with the E9X m3 which requires more friction modifiers to stay quiet and operate optimally. So if this gear oil works with the E9x m3 will it have too much friction modifiers for the F8x e-diff? I emailed castrol to ask about this and they could not dig up any more technical data or certifications from bmw, so it really didn't give me any extra confidence, so I would just stick with OEM fluids.\n\nthen CASTOL TRANSMAX may be the right oil, they are stingy with information on the CASTROL site.

So don't take any risks and stay on the oem versionTransmax is gearbox oil, it is defintely not the right oil. Also ISTA doesn't even specify its compatibility (ISTA does mention syntrax though - but again my communications with castrol were not promising).In summary yes, don't take any risks with the diff, stick with OEM fluids you get at the dealership. With the transmission and engine oil you can experiment, with the diff don't mess around.\n\nTRANSMAX is a limited slip differential oil or else they write lies on their websitehttps://www.castrol.com/fr_be/belgiu...f%C3%A9rentiel\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bythebadboyTRANSMAX is a limited slip differential oil or else they write lies on their websitehttps://www.castrol.com/fr_be/belgiu...f%C3%A9rentielWhy risk it?

I have a minimal 2 car garage that houses 2 cars all the time so really tuff to find storage spaceIt's fairly straightforward! The frames can be stored against a wall (or park over them). You'll need a little bit of space for the hydraulic pump (roughly the size of a small 1 gallon air compressor). Check it out in the image below--the frames are no big deal.Quote:I saw the Quickjack at my local Costco and was debating buying one. I think you've just tipped me over the edgeDo it! No regrets, I look forward to doing a lot of things I wouldn't normally do that would take a whole lot of effort (cleaning wheels off the car, detailing the rocker panels, etc.)Quote:I have been looking at these since I do a lot of lifting for track wheels and brakes. Is it possible to fit it in the trunk to bring to the track (5k model) and has anyone tried the 12v option.That's one of the reasons I got the 12V DC power supply, but the 7000lb version seems simply too heavy at 2 frames x 100lb + 1 pump x 30-40lb. Maybe the 5000lb one is light enough? Either way, the frames are fairly long (about a foot short of touching the tires when placed under the car) and might be awkward to get out of the car without scuffing the protector or bumper by yourself--may be a lot more manageable with 2 people. It does work great on a portable car jump starter or the car battery itself, though--tested it both ways.\n\nYeah, I don't think you'd be able to travel to the track with wheels and QuickJack's in the M2. You'd have to have the seats folded down to get the frames in and then fitting wheels around would probably be challenging (especially to also secure them safely so wheels or jacks don't move while driving).If you were trailing the vehicle then they'd be super convenient. As mentioned though, 2 people would make loading and unloading them much easier, at 84lbs for the 5000lbs models I can move them around my garage easily enough but lifting them into a vehicle without scratching or otherwise damaging the paintwork wouldn't be fun.I went with the 12V so I do have the option of taking them to places without nearby power but that was on the assumption that I'd not be transporting them in the car.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bynd2002Might just put up backup jackstands for additional peace of mindI'm not worried about needing additional jack stands. Typically good safety factors are built into products like these. Quickjack has a video of the 5000lb model holding over 15,000lbs once the mechanical locks are in place (they started by lifting 5300lbs to full rise, engaged the mechanical locks, and then used a fork lift to add more steel bars).Quote:Originally Posted bym2ruderI want one but not sure where to stow those big things.

    "content": "I've seen recommendations to change the manual transmission oil at 1200 to 2000 miles to extend life (not from BMW, of course). I found the spec of MTF LT-5 for the oil but I can't find a fill capacity. Does anyone know how much oil is needed? Thanks.\n\nWhere did you see those recommendations? I was debating changing my manual trans. fluid too but I didn't see any data supporting a change one way or the other - Blackstone didn't have enough data either to tell me whether it was necessary.At any rate, the filling capacity is 1.6 Liters. Note that the instructions say to fill until overflowing, which in my experience is typical for a manual transmission fluid change:https://www.newtis.info/tisv2/a/en/f...box/1VnXyO2l8u\n\nI thought the fluid got changed as part of the RIS?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyI thought the fluid got changed as part of the RIS?Nope, transmission fluid is not changed as part of the run in service.\n\nWell, How long are you planning to keep this car for? If you're going to replace it before the end of the Warranty period, you may as well leave it alone.Back in the days of BMW not filling the transmission with LTF-1 or LTF-2 and changing the customer for oil changes, they used to say do it every 2 years.For reference, I replaced the LTF-1 in the gearbox of my e46 330ci at 150k miles. It was as black as soot and had the consistency of milk. Noting that the stuff going in looked like apple juice, the question with the LTF is more what counts as the \"Life\" that these gearboxes are \"Filled For\"?HTH\n\nI changed my 6MT at the running in service.  Cheap insurance.  Capacity is around 1L I believe, but I'd check an actual service manual to determine exactly.  Or do the old fashioned way and use your pinky.\n\nThe recommendation for an early MT oil change is from Mike Miller of BMW CCA fame. After that it's every 30k miles. Just like the engine, a low mileage change can remove any manufacturing debris or any odd bits that are generated in the first few miles of use. Makes sense to me, anyway.Sure, if you'll only keep the car for a short time it won't make any difference, assuming the right amount of oil was put in there to start with. Probably a good bet that everything's fine but it's a simple service and provides peace of mind.\n\njust curious I track the car about 15-20 days a year. Does the transmission fluid need to change on the MT sooner? Shifts feel fine always rev match on shift and never engine brake\n\nI changed mine at 1200 miles and will do it again at 30k if I have the car still.The factory fluid by Pentosin, buy 2 of them, takes about 1.6 liters:https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw...ntosin-1052107",

The OnBoard App is kinda cool too. It tracks you, but you can choose which trips are as a passenger, via public transport, or driving. As far as AAA is concerned, public transit where I am regularly goes over 90mph and brakes hard very regularly. Coincidentally, my driving is stellar and Im projected to get a 28% rate discount next yearI cant say enough good things about AAA.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byj23I read somewhere that you're not suppose to use the BMW bumper tow eye to pull and secure the car on the flatbed..If you can't use the tow hook to pull the car onto the tow truck, what good is it?

That's a whole different force vector.I've had a driver tell me prior that they don't want the cars driven onto the bed and will only tow them onto the bed so i had it just in case. luckily the lady that was driving this flat bed just said drive it up onto it and call it good. I also wouldn't recommend using the tow hook as a hold down point either. just the normal tire tie downs are plenty.I purchased a new rear tire from tire rack at noon today and the estimated arrival of the new tire is tomorrow by 9pm. Dang that's quick haha\n\nI've been an AAA member for a couple of decades. They were awesome for my lowered Lambo. Very careful and used wood blocks like the OP mentioned. AAA didn't hesitate to respond to a call for a pricey sports car.  I know some other tow companies refuse and are worried about liability, etc.He used the tow hook to pull it onto the flatbed. But you are correct — it's not to be used to secure the car. You secure the wheels / tires to the flatbed. Why? Because then the car can ride on it's own suspension. If you try to cinch it down by the tow hook or other \"sprung\" parts of the car it will come loose as the tow truck bounces down the road. I used to tow for a garage and you should never try to strap a car down by anything that is sprung. Same goes for motorcycles. Guys are always trying to ratchet the crap out of them to compress the forks and rear shocks. All that does is blow out seals and the load can still come loose.On a side note, the tow driver was stoked to have a fun car to pick up. He sat in it so I could take his pic to send to his family back in Africa. Was a great experience all around.\n\nHmm.  Why didn’t you use the BMW Assistance?  They will tow you to the nearest BMW center for free.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byBigKuttaYes, BMWs have motion sensors that are for this very reason...someone flatbedding your car to steal it.

In simplistic terms, it has a ball in a diaphragm cup that detects movement, a real MacGyver-like design.So the parked position of the ball is stored using the current longitudinal angle and transverse angle. The tilt sensor then regularly checks for new longitudinal and transverse angles i.e. movement of the ball from its original set position when the alarm was armed and if it moves, the sensor assumes the vehicle is being raised, for example; to steal the wheels or tow the vehicle away, thus, a message is sent to the vehicle's control unit to trigger the acoustic alarm, activate the hazard lights and \"deadlocks\" (disables) the doors handles and center unlock control button. However, due to liability reasons, thedeadlockingfeature is not applicable in US spec vehicles (S8TGA Thiefproofing device).Although it might sound rudimentary in it's design, the (ball) tilt sensor algorithm is still designed to prevent a false alarms, even if the vehicle is rocked quite strongly. The alarm siren also has its own backup battery power, so even if you disconnect the vehicle's battery or cut any of the alarm's control wire(s), the sirens acoustic will still sound as usual.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPoochieI cracked open a BMW alarm tilt sensor just to examine its make up and its MO is pretty cool.

There is one exception though, BMW's old shell made LL01 TPT 5w30 was amazing oil to the point where you were on the level of aftermarket oil. Bmw's LL01FE oils absolutely suck imo, they're more optimized for fuel economy rather than protection.\n\n...still missing the point of the post.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyWell, if you read this - or other forums covering the M2 - you should expect:- the crankshaft pulley to spin the first time you downshift- the engine management to have been coded or tuned such that the warranty is already Void- the amplifier in the boot to be full of water (and therefore defunct) following the valeting the dealership gave the car prior to sale- the front wheels to have been scored by stones trapped between the brake calliper and the wheel such that they are on the point of splitting in two- the exhaust to have been cut up and then patched to 'make it sound better'- the oil drain plugs on engine, transmission and differential to be cross-threaded through multiple changes between scheduled services by previous owners- the oil/fluid to be something other than what BMW recommend as the people doing the changes above spoke to someone who said that there were better products available and they happened to have some going for less than BMWs (or the recommended manufacturers) price- the instrument cluster to be extensively scratched by overzealous scrubbing with less than totally lint-free cleaning cloths by either obsessive previous owners or dealership valeting staff- the rear springs to snap while the car is parkedand finally:- some of the many cleaning products previously used on the car may have had an adverse effect on the surfaces they were being used on.That just about sums most of it up except he forgot the famous-Left and Right rear turn signal spontaneously malfunction which has no solution. Often dealership will replace tail lights.Not to discourage you from owning the car, I still very much enjoy mine and have grown to enjoy it as a daily driver. My gauge cluster was already scratched by previous owner but it doesn't bother me. I've had the HK amp replaced under warranty although I'm still concerned since I bought a MatchUp 7 Amp.

Unlike the twin turbo N54 engines the flaws that created substantial buildup on the valves has been addressed and is not a significant issue with the N55 engine. Pretty well documented throughout the various threads on other cars that use the N55 engine.I was not aware that the valve build up was an N54 issue.  I was under the impression that it was a direct injection and PCV system issue both of which still apply to the N55.  Actually the M2 comes with 0W-30 weight whereas the N54 came with 5W-30 oil with the likelihood that the thinner oil sill have a slighter higher propensity to end up recirculating into the intake and mucking up the intakes over time.I know Ford has added Port injection to their V8 motor to reduce this issue (it is now both port and direct injection) but not aware of anything that BMW did on the N55 motors.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_c...&v=xrLNDgrIw3UI don't believe they they added port injection, oil separator or anything like that to significantly reduce this?Can you please elaborate how the N55 generation of direct injected motors will no longer muck up the valves like the N54?\n\nBut 0w30 is thinner than 5w30... so I would assume based on that reasoning it would be worse... however, I think it has to do more with their NOACK scores and not viscosity... plus the difference between a 0 wt vs 5 wt is only at start up.... from all my reading so far, the general consensus is that the n55 is much less prone to carbon buildup compared to the n54 and that it will take at least 80-100k miles for this to happen...\n\nBest valve cleaning take place on the track.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevM2But 0w30 is thinner than 5w30... so I would assume based on that reasoning it would be worse... however, I think it has to do more with their NOACK scores and not viscosity... plus the difference between a 0 wt vs 5 wt is only at start up.... from all my reading so far, the general consensus is that the n55 is much less prone to carbon buildup compared to the n54 and that it will take at least 80-100k miles for this to happen...Yes, it has more to do with NOACK but generally within the same brand and type of oil, the NOACK scores are higher on the thinner oil.  I recently spoke to Shell about the BMW M Twin Turbo 0W-40 NOACK score vs their Pennzoil Platinum 5W-40. They refused to give me the NOACK score for either but eventually I was able to get them to confirm that the 5W-40 was slightly better than the 0W-40, both made by Shell.  It was a slip where he was trying to tell me not to worry the 5W-40 was only marginally better (lower NOACK) than the 0W-40.Despite NOACK scores though, those only reduce the amount of vapors that make it through.  You also have unburned fuel that are part of the Direct Injection problem, not an N54 problem.So again, I am just asking for clarification that BMW has resolved the intake valve direct injection issue?  Ford had to add 8 more port fuel injectors to resolve it. I am just curious as to what BMW wizardry was applied to resolve it on the N55?\n\nhttp://bfy.tw/HAmh\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevM2But 0w30 is thinner than 5w30...only while cold...\n\nI know the n55 engine isn't prone to carbon deposits like the n54 and if it does get any, it will probably be in a long long time.... however, are there any downfalls to using something like the CRC GDI cleaner for the valves say every 40K miles to prevent any long term deposits?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bylook585Best valve cleaning take place on the track.While that may be true on engines that develop exhaust-side build up, hard running does absolutely NOTHING for the intake backside problems seen on DI engines.+1 on the more an N54 problem vs. the N55.

GM has tried to cure it on the 3.6 V6 with increasing valve open overlap to try and get some fuel mist onto the backside of the valves during the intake stroke with some success.\n\nCertainly no harm in the occasional \"Italian tune up\" but likely doesn't do much. But there are many who swear by it.  When it comes to carbon build up on valves of a DI engine, it's like atherosclerosis in coronary arteries... virtually everyone gets it regardless of how careful you are, and you can definitely reduce risks, but whatever you do, you will either die of it or die with it.... just take measures to reduce risks of early carbon buildup (good oil and frequent oil changes, Italian tune ups, top tier fuel/additives to keep injectors clean, valve cleaners through air intake) and if you do end up with bad gunk then clean it with walnut blast... meanwhile enjoy and have fun with your n55 because chances are it will outlive you",

I would assume that this would also be applicable to the extended warranty.Coming from the BMW corporate world, this also make sense, as the warranty programs between Canada and the US are different, so it would only make sense for the company to offer warranty repairs in the country that the vehicle was sold in.

    "title": "Tail Light Malfunction",
    "content": "I know there is already a thread on the subject, but that thread got closed. Just wanted to share, in case it helps anyone else. One of the questions was, whether the error gets stored and based on the dealership info on the invoice it does (and counts the amount of it having happened). It took me several times to capture the error message, as it sometimes went away quickly. So, for those who encounter the issue, the dealership should see it.Outcome was the same as for most, tail light assembly got replaced. The fact that it was in stock at the dealership suggests it is indeed a common issue.\n\nMine was definitely stored.  They redid the wiring harness about a year ago.  I haven’t had a problem since.\n\nYup had to do both of mine, at different times. Had a quick popup the other day after a big storm but it went away right after.\n\nI am reviving this because I have had a left rear turn signal malfunction for a bit over a year (usually lasts less than a minute before it clears itself) now on my 2018 M2.  I had the dealer look at it when it was still under warranty, but they were \"unable to duplicate\" (even though they were able to see the code, as well as my pictures of the error), and sent me on my way hoping it wouldn't return.  Is there any one cause for this error?  Since it clears itself fairly quickly, I haven't been too concerned, but it is beginning to irritate me.\n\nGuess you found out why BMW Northwest is not the best service dealer in our area.  BMW has service bulletins out on this problem.  They were suppose to check the wiring harness first.  If no problems found in the wiring then replace the taillight assembly.Poochie thinks it is a software problem and has a fix by turning off the bulb check routine.BMW Seattle replaced my rear right taillight and I have had no problem since then.  By the way I had over 100 right taillight malfunctions that they could read.\n\nIf the dealer is brushing you off you just need to be persistent. The dealers should know by now that it's a common issue. Many are replacing lights immediately without fuss (mine sent me away the first time it happened, but replaced it when I came back a second time with the light actively on, and they replaced the 2nd taillight immediately without question when the issue appeared there too). Maybe BMWNA is starting to get annoyed and your dealer is trying to wait out your warranty to make their lives easier, but that's purely speculative.Either way, you just need keep bugging your dealer until they fix it. The issue will get progressively worse.EDIT: Saw the poster brought up the software fix. You can do that, but it means other faults might be masked as well. Users have reported their taillights malfunctioning with no indications because they used the software change. I would definitely try to get the issue fixed by the dealer if you still have a warranty.",

Any help would be appreciated.Thanks.Thanks to all who responded.I tried hooking a CTEK tender but it does not detect the battery - so possibly the battery is dead. Now the question is lets say the battery is completely dead, can't I still put the jumper under the hood and power on the car to a point at least to open the trunk? Is there a main fuse that has blown? If so, where is the main fuse located.\n\nOk will jump in here...probably get flamed. But a similar situ as I store the car and always disconnect battery...but made mistake of closing trunk with it disconnected.No way to crawl through back seat...you have correct...so went to Autozone, bought the NOCO Boost Plus little gadget, paid enough for it, but at that point I could care less.Charged it good and long, popped the bonnet, as it needs no battery, (as door was open) attached NOCO properly, and in a moment, I could push the trunk button as there was enough volts??? (hey I am not into what it took to do that) and voila, open boot lid.I always have a nice towel at trunk lid opening so as to leave it safely open, but, well that time, was in a hurry and just shut the trunk out of habit.You still will need to replace the battery---for peace of mind. Fuses?? I know nothing but I DO know how to get the thing open and started now with my NOCO. Hopefully this will help you.\n\nBTW-- the CTEK was a circuit issue and yes, no detect of battery. The NOCO was an outside source for enough to activate the trunk button. Bests on this...most irritating at best to deal with it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byzazziThanks to all who responded.I tried hooking a CTEK tender but it does not detect the battery - so possibly the battery is dead.

I also leave the car in gear as I slow for a stoplight and let the EfficientDynamics gauge stay in the blue for as long as practical before coming to a stop and shifting to neutral.So if I had to guess, between auto stop/start and the EfficientDynamics battery charging (if that's the right word?), my battery is probably cycling more often and will last consequently shorter amount of time.\n\nI replaced mine at 5 years 40k miles with a diehard before my first track event. Didn't want to have issues while at the track.Measuring voltage at the battery in the car it was down to 11.8 at full charge. Turns out this car has a large parasitic load when off as when I retested battery out of the car during replacement, it went up to 12.2. Probably had another year or so left on it but doing more track events now it's piece of mind.\n\nThanks for the post. Have been wondering about this myself since I just passed the 4 year mark. In my 135 I had to replace every 3 years like clockwork. Live in Phoenix, summer is brutal on batteries. But so far no issue in the M2.Glad at least some people are getting warnings. When my 135 batteries went, it was like 1 slow crank start, then dead, or nothing at all. Really annoying",

At least check that first.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPrudhvionlineSpoke to service rep. He said keep driving until it feels unusual.

He said keep driving until it feels unusual. The light will be fixed in the break in service.You gotta love it, are you sure he didn't say 'break down' service?I hope you at least slapped him?\n\nthe light gone after 2 days. running perfectly normal now. my guess is a misfiring in the initial stage as I felt the vibrations in idle.\n\nif it is the small evap leak error code due to the gas cap then it will clear itself....just takes a little bit\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPrudhvionlineSpoke to service rep. He said keep driving until it feels unusual. The light will be fixed in the break in service.I would get that in writing.  Glad that it is gone now\n\nSame thing happened to me saturday. I picked up my '18 LCI Oct. 12, have ~300 miles on the car now. I gave her a bath on saturday, started her up and got a CEL. Still hasn't gone away, checked gas cap, and car runs fine. Called service, but they haven't gotten back to me yet. Autozone couldn't pull the code, since the car isn't in their system.\n\nI got a light that cleared after a day. It was a misfire on one of the cylinders. Car went into a truly ugly limp mode. It cleared up next time I fired it up. I took it to the dealer and their book said clear code, drive for 10 miles and if it doesn't reoccur, give car back to customer.I had a P304 that I was able to read with my phone.http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1416662\n\nI already had the break in service done at 1270 miles. Now the car has around 2300 miles and the CEL cam on again. Last time it was gone in couple of days. Its been two days now. I have a long drive this weekend. Is it worth taking the risk to drive on.\n\nYou should pickup a code reader. Better yet, get the one compatible with BimmerCode so you can also code if you like plus read/clear CEL.\n\nI started the car to go to the dealer and Surprisingly it didn't lit up. It was lit for 2 days. A similar behavior from 2000 miles ago.\n\nMy check engine light lit up yesterday while I was putting around in rush hour traffic. I'm taking it in to the dealer later today.  Also, the day before yesterday my idrive screen reset while I was driving. The car hasn't felt different bit it's all a little unsettling. I've done the run in service already and I'm at just under 1300mi.\n\nWhat gasoline are you guys using?\n\nI'm using California's best, 91 oct\n\nI got it back yesterday and per my SA it was just an engine misfire. The light had already turned off when i was on my way to take it to the dealer and so far no other issues.\n\nI had the light checked at the dealer and its a engine misfire somewhere around 500miles. I did had the iDrive screen restart once while driving.\n\nThe car is at the dealer from past two days. getting the diagnostic done and spark plugs and coils being checked. they couldn't figure out the problem yet.",

    "content": "What's everybody's thoughts on this ? I personally would never remove spark plugs with an impact , but I just saw the technician who did my spark plugs do thisThink I should take it to an Indy to make sure the threads are good ? I may … next time the dealer touches my plugs it will be out of warranty .\n\nThe technician is an idiot; it's wayyyyy to easy to break the insulator or strip the spark plug threading on an aluminum block with the torque from an impact gun or power ratchet, which would be a total nightmare to rethread.If the plug had seized up, he could of simple hit it with a lite coat of WD-40 and use a breaker bar to loosen it by hand. He instead took the riskiest route.I don't know if any damage was done and it would be difficult to gauge but I would still try to get an analysis to verify if this is the case.\n\nThis is exactly why i will do myself my spark plugs and oil change next time even if my car is still under warranty with free maintenance.I'll be sure everything is done correctlyI'll be sure that my new ngk plug are gaped correctly and installed with 18 lbs of torqueI'll be able to put the oil I want in the carCan't believe he used impact on spark plugs\n\nBMWs technician is an idiot , but I have it all on dash cam.He also decided to take my car for a quick burn before bringing it in the garage ….did 2 illegal u turns , broke the speed limit and revved the Shit out if it in first and second .\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byROBM2CIt's technician is an idiot , but I have it all on dash cam.

It may not work but at least you gave it a try and can always put the videos on YouTube for our enjoyment.Sorry about this unfortunate situation but since dealerships cannot retain their talent nowadays service is going down, way down.\n\nWell I have started with emails to the service advisor who took care of the car , service advisor manager , and shop manager . After that I will send one to the general manager .Yes dealer talent is sub par these days, buying a used car with all dealer receipts does not add value anymore it takes it away . Dealers ruin cars. Best to take it to your favourite Indy or do it your self .I haven't thought of the extended warranty I will definitely bring this up .Thanks\n\nIf the dealer doesn't take care of you contact BMW Canada directly.https://www.bmw.ca/en/fastlane/Contact-Us.html\n\nYou'll be doing all of us a favor - the only real disincentive for this kind of BS is if the techs and service managers know they could get in trouble for it.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is happening to lots of performance cars in a lot of dealerships .If you don't have a dash cam or don't wait for your vehicle it's getting \" test driven \" and you wouldn't be none the wiser .I'm almost going to have a running go pro next time to catch every second .Luckily my cam was recording at all the important parts .The GM got back to me and said he's investigating …\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byROBM2CI'm pretty sure this is happening to lots of performance cars in a lot of dealerships .If you don't have a dash cam or don't wait for your vehicle it's getting \" test driven \" and you wouldn't be none the wiser .I'm almost going to have a running go pro next time to catch every second .Luckily my cam was recording at all the important parts .The GM got back to me and said he's investigating …Most dealers around here unplug your dashcam and they have a notice that you're supposed to disable it before leaving your car.\n\nI've seen plugs removed with a low powered tool but not with an impact (hammer) gun. I'd be concerned.Hope they didn't impact it back on.\n\nWell here is what the Gm of the dealership told me .He said it's BMWs procedure and happens on all of their cars. Apparently they crack the plugs with a hand ratchet ….then they unscrew them with an electric ratchet ( I'm pretty sure it was an impact ratchet by the sound and look of it )Also apparently they hand screw them in , then tighten them with the electric ratchet that apparently is specked to the exact torque value .Asked about the joy ride he dodge it a few times and said he needs to confirm .He wants to meet and look at the car , for what idk…I'm going to review the videos and try to isolate the frame with the \"electric ratchet \"Why would it be procedure to use electric tools on aluminum heads ? Goes against everything I ever learnt about cars.So apparently all of our plugs are changed this way .\n\n@kellyzerxThat's a dealer I would never go to again .Nobody has a policy like that unless their doing stuff they don't want seen .Go pro on your back corner window up top in the corner behind the drivers seat most won't see it until it's too late .Or soon it's going to be hidden cameras at this rate lol\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byROBM2C@kellyzerxThat's a dealer I would never go to again .Nobody has a policy like that unless their doing stuff they don't want seen .Go pro on your back corner window up top in the corner behind the drivers seat most won't see it until it's too late .Or soon it's going to be hidden cameras at this rate lolI don't know what they're going to do when the day arrives when recording cameras are built into the car.Three different BMW dealers and a Toyota dealer have all unplugged my dashcams here in Toronto.\n\nYou need to check if you are in a 'one party consent' or a 'two party consent' state for recordings - IIRC, in a 2-party state it is illegal to tape somebody w/o their consent so it gives them justification to disable the gear.  If you do record and upload it or share it about, they can sick the lawyers on you.  I don't think this would apply to a device that simply recorded where/when/how fast a car was driven while in their custody (I don't think ABS activation, illegal road speeds, or burnouts are a standard part of the service check).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byROBM2CWell here is what the Gm of the dealership told me .He said it's BMWs procedure and happens on all of their cars.

Goes against everything I ever learnt about cars.So apparently all of our plugs are changed this way .Spark plugs isn't something overly complicated so it's not something that most techs would've looked up ISTA for, but I'm fairly confident the instructions don't say to unscrew and tighten spec'd to the correct torque with an electric tool (unless that's changed in the past decade+). When I used to be a BMW technician, I did use an electric screwdriver gun to take out the plugs after I've cracked them loose by hand. But, the my electric screwdriver gun wasn't very powerful and you could pretty much stop it by hand if you wanted to. Install was only ever by hand ratchet and torque wrench though. Sure, I understand dealer tech works flat rate, but I always operated on the principle \"Would I do this to my own vehicle?\".If the dealer says that the way this dealer technician did it is BMW procedure, then have them show documentation. Have them show you on the instructions where it mentions to use an electric tool. BMW is notorious for documentation so if it's procedure, it'll be in there.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMaynardYou need to check if you are in a 'one party consent' or a 'two party consent' state for recordings - IIRC, in a 2-party state it is illegal to tape somebody w/o their consent so it gives them justification to disable the gear.

I don't think this would apply to a device that simply recorded where/when/how fast a car was driven while in their custody (I don't think ABS activation, illegal road speeds, or burnouts are a standard part of the service check).I think wire tap laws are what you're referencing.Generally only applicable in situations in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (home, public restrooms, healthcare settings, etc).In public spaces there is typically no expectation of privacy.  However, Wwhat you do with the recordings could potentially be restricted (for instance, harassment).Recording events within and around your car would generally be viewed as acceptable use. The dealership would of course have the right to refuse you service if recording was in violation of their polices but they should never tamper with your personal effects / devices without prior expressed permission.\n\nBefore you guys jump down the mechanic's throat so fast, there is a VERY valid reason for him to drive the car.Sometimes, if the spark plugs, or coils are stuck, a great technique to free them is to get the cylinders hot.  It's also better to bring the temp up quickly (hence, the 1st & 2nd gear pulls) because ideally, you would want the head temperature to come up quickly and keep the spark plug as cool as possible.  I'm willing to bet that a lot of mechanics do this without even checking if they are in fact stuck.As far as the use of an impact wrench, that seems overly aggressive to me, and probably something I wouldn't want to do.All that said, I am not a mechanic, however, I have worked on my own cars for the past 37 years.Also, note that I am not one that is comfortable with leaving my car with mechanics.  That's why I do most of the stuff myself.  I do it out of fear, not because I'm trying to save money.\n\nSome tq wrenches are pretty weak. I use one for almost everything. But just like my elbow, my trigger finger is calibrated to the correct tq as well. YOLO!\n\nI reviewed more camera footage and it gets worse … the parts guy was bringing over the parts and dropped 2 spark plugs on the ground . 🤦They just picked them up and put them with the rest .",

    "title": "Creaking Driver's Seat Fixed!",
    "content": "A few months after getting my new car, the driver's seat would creak as I would accelerate or brake.  I could rock back and forth in the seat and easily recreate it.  It was incredibly annoying.  Noises usually don't bother me much, but this made me not want to drive the car.  I brought it to the dealer, and the seat frame was the culprit.  I unfortunately didn't get much detail.  After the fact, I realized I should have asked to see the bad part just to understand what was happening.  Anyway, they replaced it, and so far it is as good as new!On another note, they gave me a 330i G20 as a loaner.  After driving it around for a couple of days, it's a nice car and a great commuter, but I was glad to be back in my M2.  The G20 is boring in comparison!\n\nMy car makes the same sound, do you have the receipt that shows what part number was replaced?\n\nMine started doing this after about 1000 miles.. hmm\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byspeedsniceMy car makes the same sound, do you have the receipt that shows what part number was replaced?I sure do.

I also can recreate it be rocking side to side or back and forth. Very noticeable under lateral load in turns.

Both of the seat bolsters appear to rub both sides of the center console so I'm surprised they'd go through lengths to apply soft velcro to the buckle but not protect the expensive seats. Tape solves the wear problem, but yah, it doesn't look good at all and you gum up the alcantara. Seat bolsters are just too big for the cabin. That or the center console is 2 mm too wide.

This might be just exclusive to the VW group only.The dimming glass BMW now uses is difference from VW and is not very opec when activated, so I can see why they might of omitted it for safety reasons on the passenger side (M340i glass below).Of course this is just my opinion, I could be wrong.. 🤷🏻\n\nany way to retrofit this?

I believe the BMW tech eventually found that it was catching on some wire and could have eventually worn down or snapped the cable.

I took it to my dealer and they essentially refused to look for it and said  it was just because the car was cold.  The clutch pedal does not operate as smoothly as it did when I first took delivery of the car.  It does not seem to affect the operation of the clutch.Does anyone have any ideas or have better searching abilities than I?Any and all help is appreciated!I have a 2017 M2.\n\nThere may be a number of reasons why your clutch isn't as smooth as it once was, but the bits that move in the bell housing are extremely unlikely catch on anything.

Where I live (Saudi Arabia), dealerships here have shorter intervals (10k km or 1 year), that's mainly due to the heat around here.I took my car in for service yesterday since I've driven almost 10k km since my previous service. However, the dealership required I get the 'short service intervals' programed/flashed to make things easier for me and them in the future.Anyone heard of anything similar to this? Would that have any effect on the car's computer (head unit) or is it something completely safe?\n\nI'm in Bahrain and bought my M2C new here.My car service interval is programmed for generally 12k km or 1 year, which isn't far off from what you've stated. It's actually Condition Based Servicing (CBS) and could be as high as 15k km i.e. it's not a fixed number.Regardless of what the schedule is, I take my car in every 7.5k km (5k mi) for servicing. Your dealership will also oblige if you don't have the free maintenance package (Bahrain does not offer it).Overall, it can't be \"recoded\" because its based on your driving habits. Just keep track of mileage yourself and bring it in accordingly.

I didn't know about the Condition Based Servicing. The previous service was done because it had been 1 year since I had the service before it.

I wouldn't mind paying for the service, but I'm already on an extended maintenance package and it would be a waste of money (in my eyes at least) to pay for maintenance twice, especially that it isn't cheap here and I don't track my car.\n\nQuote:If that's the case, would it be safe to drive the car around until I get an alert telling me to take it in for service?

My interval is based on Toyota's interval for their Land Cruisers in desert regions. What is considered a \"safe\" interval depends on whether you're keeping the car short or long term.You hear a lot about walnut/dry ice blasting, installing oil catch cans and generally questioning whether the service intervals are just for what BMW considers the lifetime of the car - warranty end period. There is a reason for that based on people's experience with not only BMW, but all manufacturers.I can't answer whether its safe to just take it in when it alerts you - it depends.Do you want to keep the car around only during the warranty and maintenance period? If so, then yes it is perfectly safe to do so.If you plan to keep the car for the long run, then no, it is not in your best interest to follow a 10k+ km interval for oil changes or believing the transmission fluid is \"lifetime fluid\".Toyota follows a 5,000 km/6 month oil change interval for Land Cruisers in the Middle East. I do 7,500 km/6 months, so even I am not as stringent as they are. Albeit, I considered that their interval is inclusive of people actually taking their LCs off-road, so I have some leeway.Since you have a maintenance package, you can do interim oil changes at an indie and request they don't reset the CBS. I've read several people do that and, based on reviews, I'm sure you can find a reputable one in Saudi Arabia.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDooba97Short answer - Changing your oil early is cheap insurance.

That's why I got the package for cheap.I ended up paying for the oil change myself which they gave me a really good deal on, I practically paid nothing for it, and I asked them not to reset the CBS, they agreed to do it that way. So, I'll be taking in my car every 7k km instead, that's more reasonable than every 12k km.They actually advised against the factory recommend service intervals, even the shorter ones and said it's not ideal for our weather conditions in the area. I'm assuming it's the same in Bahrain.Thanks again for the advice.",

It sits directly behind the rear passenger arm rest. I found simply removing this panel provided a huge improvement in normalising the cabin pressure.

    "title": "Electrical noise in cabin",
    "content": "Hey all. I recently coded out ASD using Bimmercode and started noticing a very high pitched electrical noise in the cabin. The noise is not too loud, but definitely can be heard over an idling engine. It's a high pitched noise that you'd normally get from electronics power adapters. Like current flowing through or something.I tried to trace where it's coming from. I'm roughly guessing it's either the center speaker, the center screen, or the gauge cluster, but I can't pinpoint the exact location.I get this noise with the engine on or off. I tried rebooting the iDrive system but the sound is still there even during the reboot. Fwiw I don't think coding out ASD caused the problem - it just let me hear it more clearly.Does anyone have the same issue? Or know how to solve it?\n\nWeird. I too have coded out ASD with Bimmercode, no such issue. Is it possible there's another electronic device there someplace causing this - like a dealer lot tracker left in the car? It's obviously not in the OBD port or you'd have already stumbled on it.\n\nI would pull the fuse on the amp and see if the noise goes away.  Sounds like an amp problem to me.\n\nStart with some basic troubleshooting. Reenable ASD and see if the issue goes away. If it does you're on the right track. If not then it might be something else that was coded or some other coding potentially conflicting with the ASD disable. In that case I would reverse every change back to stock and see if it goes away. If it does work your way back up one change at until you find the culprit. GL\n\nI found a similar thread on X5:https://g05.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1589172This person uploaded a videohttps://g05.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...3&postcount=37which sounds very close to what I'm hearing.I'll try pulling the amp fuse and report back.By the way I think there are a couple fuses related to infotainment and amp, do you know which one it is?\n\nThanks for the replies! Here are the experiments I did so far:1. turn off the center screen - doesn't help2. turn down interior light (both through the dial left to the steering column, and also through \"Vehicle Settings\") - doesn't help3. restore ASD through Bimmercode - doesn't help4. Pull fuse 121 - noise goes away! (see pics for the exact fuse I pulled)Of course after pulling the fuse the center screen stops working, and the speakers as well. At least I didn't hear the \"gong\" at start up.At this point I'm suspecting the noise is coming from the speakers. I listened very closely by literally glueing my ear to all the speakers, and I'm quite certain that the noise is coming from the speakers mounted on the door inside of the side mirror. (Not sure what the technical name is for the speaker, but it's the one on the door, the upper one, with \"Harman Kardon\" on it). Both left and right speakers are making the noise.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byhotpxl(Not sure what the technical name is for the speaker, but it's the one on the door, the upper one, with \"Harman Kardon\" on it)Tweeter\n\nReporting back, TLDR is I resolved the issue with ASD harness.It turns out that ASD was the problem after all. Even if I coded back the ASD I still get the noise (albeit slightly different frequency). I googled it more and found some posts on X3 forums about this issue, that's when I suspected ASD. I installed a TechnicPNP harness and the noise is fully gone. Of course there's still tube rush in the tweeter (like any other audio system), but it's very minimal and within normal range, and the tone itself is not annoying anymore.I don't care about fake engine noise either way, but one great benefit of installing the harness is the audio quality is now much much better.

Great for oncoming traffic and I turn it off when following cars\n\nThanks for the replies guys.Did you guys just follow the steps in that video or was it different for M2C?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDriftKr6lThanks for the replies guys.Did you guys just follow the steps in that video or was it different for M2C?https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...ive+headlightsI followed the directions from a previous thread.  If I remember correctly there are two different functions to change. One is anti-dazzle and the other is VLD (Variable Light Distribution).I was thinking of cross referencing with the Video to make sure mine has all the changes. The thread is long with lots of opinions. VLD is absolutely safe to code, anti dazzle is controversial but if you don't use it when following traffic it's safe. Just push the auto headlight button on the turn signal lever and use the high beams off and on like the old days.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAlpsRiderhttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...ive+headlightsI followed the directions from a previous thread.

Lots of conflicting information in it - yes you can enable it in US-spec cars, works perfectly. You can enable it, but it's not the same result as a euro car because the headlights themselves are different and not built for it. Won't blind oncoming traffic at all.

Might blind some oncoming traffic. Blah blah blah. Which is accurate? Never could come to any firm conclusion from reading everything I could find.Right, I've got through all of those threads and there was never a definitive conclusion. Some people say it works flawlessly, others say it's dangerous. I saw the different PNs for the euro headlights vs the US ones, but that doesn't really prove anything, as it could be anything from a simple label change for us regulations vs euro, or more major with actual hardware changes. Someone even tried to post a side by side internals comparison of the US vs the Euro ones,but it turned out to be fake, as an image search turned out that the one headlight was from a MINI...So again, I've just gotta do it for myself and come to my own conclusion. That, or I'd have to get in contact with some of my old BMW colleagues who would be able to give the definitive answer.\n\nIn my experience it definitely blinds other vehicles. I've personally tested it by driving in front of my 2018 M2 LCI with my wife driving the m2. It looks like your brights are on.You can also tell the light is not shielded properly, it is very obvious when you approach a vehicle from behind on a dark road … it clearly throws light into their rear and side view mirrors.Oncoming traffic I have not been able to test as that is harder to arrange.\n\nUpdate on this headlight coding, as I've finally had a chance to try out the Variable Light Distribution (VLD) and Glare Free High Beams (GFHB).VLD: Don't really notice this too much. It's clear that it's working, as when stopped, the left headlight is dipped slightly, and the right headlight is up. Out on the road though, it's hard to notice the difference. On the highway, it does seem that the light throw is a little farther, but it's marginal at most. Helpful tip; when you throw it into reverse, the light pattern goes back to factory setup, so it's easy to see if you've coded it correctly.GFHB:Definitely notice this one working properlyand coding according to my previous post worked. As others have pointed out, it isn't as sophisticated as some of the more expensive models with the tunneling effect, but it clearly dips the individual beams to not blind oncoming traffic and coming up behind other vehicles. Works great to light up road signs and the ditch when traffic is in front of you, and it clearly swivels the light as you proceed to pass, then finally dipping as you get within 20ft of vehicle.It wasn't 100% flawless, as I noticed it is a little slower to react around large trucks, but not to the point of blinding them in their rearview mirrors. Over the 200miles or so that I had them turned on, there was only one instance where I blinded/flashed another driver. I came up behind a pickup in the left lane, and as he transitioned over to the right, the high beams switched on unexpectedly and the guy wasn't too happy when I passed him, as it seemed like I flashed him (probably swearing at me and saying \"Who's this F**king a-hole\"). I don't really attribute this to the GFHB coding, as I have had the automatic high beams do weird things like that previously. But other than this one mishap, they worked very well and as I expected them to.So, after months of reading countless threads/comments going back and forth on whether or not this can be safely coded into M2 LCIs (and subsequent models) and used on public roads,I can definitively say that GFHB works as intended.Hope this puts this debate to rest finally!\n\nHey Fred,Thank you for updating us. Two questions:1. Can you code GFHB without coding VLD?2. Could you share the exact coding you did for both for sake of completeness in this thread?Quote:Originally Posted byFred ConowayUpdate on this headlight coding, as I've finally had a chance to try out the Variable Light Distribution (VLD) and Glare Free High Beams (GFHB).VLD: Don't really notice this too much.

You'll likely find you are in fact blinding other drivers, just as I did. In my experimenting in this manner, I found there must be missing hardware in the headlights in USA vehicles which prevent light from being properly shielded.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDriftKr6lHey Fred,Thank you for updating us. Two questions:1. Can you code GFHB without coding VLD?2. Could you share the exact coding you did for both for sake of completeness in this thread?DriftKr6lUsed this post fromAndrewC1989:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...8&postcount=50To answer your questions:1. Cannot answer this as I have both coded. I would assume that you can since the functions are separate in Bimmercode2. See above link. Because I am on Android, I was not able to select both options in the menus for LUT_FLC_FORWARDLIGHTING_Y, C_AFS_ENA, and C_HBA_ENA. I believe I only selected the bottom-most options, as this should have enabled both, but I would have to go back in and check that for sure.One final tibit of info, I re-watched a video (see below) that was posted previously on one of the other threads. This was a Euro spec vehicle. I didn't notice my lights tunneling around cars as much as it did here, but it may have had to do with the difference between 2-lane highways versus interstate driving. I think I will have to do some more driving on darker roads to see if I can really see the tunneling effect, or if my lights are doing something different. Regardless, they still do more than simply shutting on and off, and they do not blind drivers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEBCdv-f9Fw",

On the plus side, this isn't one of those problems that signifies abuse or mistreatment unless it was caused by a tune (and unlikely they would have replaced parts under warranty if it was).\n\nPlugs are replaced under maintenance at year 3.

    "content": "Good morning everyone. I'm in the process of purchasing a 2020 M2 Competition (Laguna blue) that has a ton of BMW performance bits including the gold wheels, cs brake upgrade, carbon fiber diffuser, side skirts, front spoiler, kidneys, full ppf, etc.. I was scheduled to pick up the car today from the dealer (not a BMW franchise dealer) and just received a call that when they were replacing the clutch (they had represented that this job was already done on the car) they realized that the alignment tool did not come with the clutch kit and they are now having to put me off until next week before they can finish the job. They also put new tires on her.My question is would it be normal to have to change the clutch on a 12,000 mile example? I have the carfax that shows two prior owners and a reposession from the second owner. Car was originally sold by Germain BMW of Naples and the second owner bought it from Hgreglux (2nd owner was the repo).This dealership is in New Port Richey, FL and I am certainly not buying the car at a bargain price.I'm open to suggestions on whether I should cancel this deal (all paperwork signed but vehicle not delivered) and pursue a different vehicle or would it be somewhat normal for have to replace the clutch on well driven M2 Comp?Thanks!\n\nIt is extremely unusual to replace the clutch at 12,000 miles.

With the AGA Jack Rod, I can simply pop it into place on my floor jack, and have no more need to place an additional jack stand under the car making things faster and more convenient.Quote:Originally Posted byIndex0:00 Intro0:13 Why we use jack stands0:48 How the Jack Rod works1:50 Floor jack compatibility4:50 Making the top cup more narrow5:49 Jack rod disassembly and inspection13:03 Jack rod use with car14:23 Conclusion\n\nReally neat tool! Kind of expensive for what it is, but really neat! I do wish it had more height adjustment range though.\n\nThat looks interesting. I use my QuickJack, I'm fairly trusting of the locking mechanism on those but will occasionally use jack stands too if I'll be spending time actually under the vehicle while raised.This price looks perhaps slightly better than that other jack stand option which I've seen recommended a bunch of times with the jack-pad type thing which then has legs you can slide in after lifting the car to put a jack stand under the same point as you used to lift the car. I liked that concept too but think it was also $200+ which just seems extreme when I'd rather just go with using a traditional jack stand for the money savings. The extra convenience seems difficult to justify the extra expense, this at least looks more reasonable.",

Sucks for you.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bynioh_lbbm2Some of the mid interval changes were probably screwed up and had the CBS reset when it shouldn't have been. Sucks for you.^This. The spark plug replacement assumes only the factory counted oil changes (excluding the 1200 mile break in) at 1 year or 10k miles. Your plugs were definitely changed too early which isn't really a big deal since that is covered up to 30k under the free maintenance. I would take advantage of their error though and try to get another set before free maintenance runs out at 30k lol.\n\nAt my last free service, the plugs were replaced on my 2018 with only 16,000 miles.  I asked the SA about this and he told me BMW replaces plugs after every third oil change regardless of mileage.  Since they were still paying for it under the free 3 year maintenance plan, I didn't question it, but it would have been a different story if it was coming out of my wallet.\n\nJust to keep all relevant info in one thread .My 2020 Bmw M2C has 11 900kms on it .Going in for 3rd oil change dealer is changing the plugs and air filter as well even with such low mileage , they say its due and its free so why not.Seems a bit premature but I guess its every 2 years if your a low mileage driver .\n\nAs another member stated BMW changes the spark plugs every third oil change.  In my case it was after three years due to low mileage during the pandemic.",

    "content": "I was not paying attention and accidentally filled up my F87 with 87 fuel. Should I siphon it out, or will I be fine with just one tank?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byLastBastion1005I was not paying attention and accidentally filled up my F87 with 87 fuel. Should I siphon it out, or will I be fine with just one tank?Personally I would just take it easy driving out half a tank or so, and top off with the good stuff.Edit: Even better if you have access to high octane race gas…couple gallons will get you back to premium levels.\n\nI just did the exact same thing.  This car does not like 87 thats for sure.  I just left it in and topped it off when it got down to 3/4.  Ive done this twice now and still had a 1/4 when I had the brain fart so I will top it off once more at 3/4 before running it down.  Its already not noticeable but prior to the first top off it was noticeably coarse and less power/responsiveness.\n\nThe cars smart enough to adapt by pulling timing, but you must baby it like crazy to ensure no major knock events damage the engine. Also make sure you don't have low rpm, high gear, high load events because LSPI with low octane fuels would be devestating.A can of octane booster would help if you had some available locally, just make sure the octane booster is good and not a bad brand.\n\nIf you have a full tank just pour in some octane booster and go easy on it. Top it off as soon as your burn off a couple of gallons with high octane gas and you'll be fine.\n\n😳I'd siphon that gas into somebody else's carAnd then I would follow up with some BMW fuel system cleaner prior to properly filling up again\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///M TOWN😳I'd siphon that gas into somebody else's carAnd then I would follow up with some BMW fuel system cleaner prior to properly filling up againYou can't siphon these cars anymore, bmw put something in the fuel filler neck that prevents tubes from going down into the tank.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceQuote:Originally Posted by///M TOWN😳I'd siphon that gas into somebody else's carAnd then I would follow up with some BMW fuel system cleaner prior to properly filling up againYou can't siphon these cars anymore, bmw put something in the fuel filler neck that prevents tubes from going down into the tank.Good to know dudeCan you drain the tanks content from below ⁉️\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///M TOWNGood to know dudeCan you drain the tanks content from below ⁉️No I do not believe there is a hole to drain from below either. So if you are really in a pinch to drain the tank these are the options:1. Take off the lpfp hat and you have access directly into the tank from inside of the car.2. Disconnect the lpfp line and turn the car on into accessory mode and let the lpfp pressurize itself and that will cause fuel to drain. I am not sure if the pump cuts off eventually so you might have to cycle the ignition alot.3. if you have an inline fuel filter like the one bend calibration sells there is a bung on it that allows you to depressurize the fuel line and that will allow you to empty the tank like method 2 but you don't have to disconnect anything.\n\nJust take it easy on this tank, and/or add some octane booster if you're really paranoid. Complete waste of time/money to drain the 87. IMHO.\n\nTake it easy like others have said. If you're really concerned baby it till you're down about 4 gallons and find 100 octane to replace it with.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevinCJust take it easy on this tank, and/or add some octane booster if you're really paranoid. Complete waste of time/money to drain the 87. IMHO.Oh absolutely not if it's not easily done I'm clearly it's notBut I'd definitely stick a small bottle of BMW fuel system cleaner in before I refill the tank just to make myself feel better\n\nRun it to near empty, pop a bottle of octane booster, fill up with premium, and you'll be fine. Do this for the next 2 or so fills if you're still concerned.These tanks are small so you'll be back to the gas station before the end of the week.\n\nNot to worry. Don't flog the beast (the car) and, as mentioned previously, the gas tank is so darn small that topping off with \"Supreme\" and you will be fine in no time all.

It will not start because you were in accessory mode to begin with and you have to click the button again to start, but you can do that with the clutch pedal pulled out a bit.

With your foot off the clutch, pressing the start button twice will put it in ignition on mode. Pressing the clutch in after this will not put it back into ACC mode. Same as an automatic (but with brake instead of clutch).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byLaguna Seca BlueUnless something has changed dramatically since the E9x generation, you can indeed pop the clutch while in gear on a rolling bmw to get it it running.

In fact early BMWs under the free maint did not even include the 1 year oil changes. You had to know to ask for them or it was two years.Basically bmw pushed the limits and it has cost them in long term reliability.The fact is, most bmw auto transmissions will fail at 100k miles due to lack of fluid changes.\n\nhttps://www.bmwusa.com/explore/bmw-v...nty-books.html\n\nAs stated above it is condition based.  When I track my car 80 mins on track knocks off about 3,000 miles of oil life on a hot day.  You never go for more than 12 months without an oil change regardless of miles.Since I track my car I pay no attention to the condition based interval and do oil analysis and change oil between 4,000 and 6,000 miles based on the number of track days I do.  Because of heat I run a slightly thicker oil based on a recommendation by the good folks at Bimmerworld.

It heats my garage, and I get to stare at the engine whenever I go to the garage, so win/win/win.Yeah I think dropping the hood allows it to latch better than trying to push on it, same thing applies to my acura and honda they don't latch well when you push.I don't think heat will damage the wiring and plastic bits too much on bmws since bmw does use alot higher quality components compared to subaru for instance, but it shouldn't hurt to pop the hood everytime. Me personally I just don't bother.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceYeah I think dropping the hood allows it to latch better than trying to push on it, same thing applies to my acura and honda they don't latch well when you push.I don't think heat will damage the wiring and plastic bits too much on bmws since bmw does use alot higher quality components compared to subaru for instance, but it shouldn't hurt to pop the hood everytime. Me personally I just don't bother.I always drop it, for sure, I'm just going to have to drop it from higher up.  I only pushed on that edge for a moment to see if it would latch under a bit of pressure, but it didn't, despite going all the way down.  Weird, really.\n\nScrew in the left bump stop a hair.If that doesn't do it, unscrew the left hood latch a hair.Should get a nice even close each time.\n\nI definitely did the \"look back\" at my car a few months ago and thought \"wait...what?\" and saw my hood was slightly unlatched on one side. I'm pretty sure I didn't need to open it again to latch it all the way, just give it a shove, but i'm not 100 percent sure, it was a few months ago.So yes.\n\nI think the proper way to close it is to let it drop from about 18 inches (its in the owners manual someplace). Ive never had a problem. Yet at least.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevinCI think the proper way to close it is to let it drop from about 18 inches (its in the owners manual someplace). Ive never had a problem. Yet at least.I'm probably not letting it drop from high enough.  But I guess that's because in the past, any car that I dropped the hood on that didn't latch, it was from the middle.  I don't guess I've ever had a car with a latch on either side.  And to my thinking, if you're dropping it straight down and one side is latching but the other isn't, it's probably an adjustment issue.  But my gaps look good.  I think I'll spend some time tonight looking closer at where the latch strikes, and the gaps to see if anything looks out of adjustment.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///MPhaticI'm probably not letting it drop from high enough.

My shop foreman doesn't drop it as high but he pushes down on the hood while letting go to get it to accelerate to a faster speed.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceIf it was the striker being too high you would have a mark on one side of the hood and not the other.For me if I don't drop it high enough it doesn't latch properly either, you have to drop it at a fairly decent height. My shop foreman doesn't drop it as high but he pushes down on the hood while letting go to get it to accelerate to a faster speed.I checked everything out really well tonight.First the hood latches.  They were both seated fine, and upon pulling the plastic pieces down they both have 5 threads showing.Lowering the hood down and looking at how the hood striker hits the latch there is a difference.On the driver's side (the side that always shuts) the striker hits first by about a ¼\", and the striker comes down perfectly in the middle of the latch.  (first picture)The passenger's side seems to make good contact, but the hood striker is positioned off center to the left, making the latch not contact the middle of the hood striker, but off center. (second picture)I'm wondering if I should try to just adjust the latch a bit, as the striker can't be adjusted, or if they are all this way?\n\nI drop mine from about 12\" high and I've never have any issues\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///MPhaticI'm wondering if I should try to just adjust the latch a bit, as the striker can't be adjusted, or if they are all this way?Yup, I would unscrew the latch a hair.  I posted earlier and wrote striker but meant the latch.\n\nMine closes fine with no issues.\n\nYes",

This is around 0F, and as you blend down this threshold increases.Having run E85 blends thru several winters, I’ve found the best general rule of thumb to not experience 5-10sec cold starts for me is to match the Emix to the ambient temp. Meaning E30 for 30F, E40 for 40F, E50 for 50F, and any mix above 60F starts fine.I’m currently working on the new BM3 Stg 2+ E50 beta map with Halim and I have E51 in the tank and the average daytime temps this week are 20-30F, so hopefully I don’t kill my battery trying to start up!It’s also becoming a challenge just to have enough grip even for a 4th gear pull bc we’re likely >550wftlbs and I’m still running 4S’s!

I'm not even sure the coolant was up to temperature since the ride was 10 minutes at most, and it was about 25 degrees out.  I figured it would shut itself off, and indeed when I came back to the car later it was off.I previously had noted the same thing a couple weeks ago, after the drive to the gym as well.  And one other time I noticed it was in my garage after getting home from a drive.  When it happened in the garage, it shut off within 5 minutes or so.Is this something I should bring up to the dealer or is it completely normal?  I would understand if it was during the summer heat and additional cooling was needed after the coolant stopped circulating, but this was in freezing temperatures in the dead of winter.\n\nIt's normal.

Especially in that ambient temperature.Might be normal, but it's is not bcs. oil cooling.I personally would check coolant temperature and potentially codes.I hooked up my OBDII adapter and used the Dash Command iOS app with a coolant gauge yesterday.  Outside temp was 20 F.Made a quick pit stop at the CVS around the corner less than 1 minute away and shut down.  The fan was not running.Then went for a 30 minute drive.  The coolant temp was up to temperature pretty quickly, between 5 and10 minutes.  It went to 217, then dropped to 195, and stayed in the 200-210 range for the rest of the drive.  When I arrived at my destination the gauge was showing 205.  The fan was not running after shutting off the car.I checked to see if there were any stored codes and there were none.The car sat for 2.5 hours during my visit.  The ride home was 2 miles and took 5 minutes.  I had disconnected the OBDII adapter, so not sure what the temperature was.  When I shut the car off in the garage, the fan was still running.  When I checked 5 minutes later, it had already turned off.My guess is that it's nothing to worry about, but it seems to be an odd algorithm that decides whether it will stay running or not.\n\nOk, that indicates ok water pump.",

What I am going to mention below occurred at Shelly BMW in Buena Park.For the past month, my M2C has been bugging me to bring it in for service, so I went ahead and did it for warranty purposes, mind you I changed my own oil using Motul LL-01 FE back in July (3,329 miles on the odo.  Waiting in the lobby, a service advisor calls my name and immediately says to me, I have some bad news, your car needs new tires.  Uh, come again?  So I proceed to walk outside with him and he starts pointing at the outer edge of the tire saying my tires are worn out. I point out to him that my tires are nowhere near the wear indicator and then he proceeds to give me some BS response.  I told him Im no spring chicken when it comes to tires/automotive repair and the tires look fine. He continues to push for new tires and an alignment and I just say no 3 or 4 more times.  I noticed on my repair sheet that he put my tires in the red and that I declined tires.After doing the initial paperwork, the SA says there are other services available for my car that are not part of the maintenance plan. I entertain him asking him what else he is trying to sell me.  He lists off a fuel system clean, an engine oil flush, and something else, but I lost interest and stopped paying attention to him.So here are pictures of my tires which have 5,446 miles on them. Tell me what you think.\n\nThe SA is an idiot.  Those tyres look almost brand new.\n\nNo sign of mis-alignment on the outer edges?Noting that the SA probably has some kind of up-selling target to hit and will therefore try it on with every customer, there is a faint possibility that they got the customer/car mixed up (so there's some other owner out there driving around on 'semi-slick' tires without realising it), and - rather than admit the mistake - kept right on digging...Maybe use that as an approach for a question to the Service Manager?\n\nThis kind of thing is becoming standard practice at dealerships, unfortunately.You already know the answer to your question; your tires are fine.\n\nYup, tires look fine. And hilarious that the SA was trying to get you to add unnecessary service items. They should know that most M owners probably know more about service requirements than they do.\n\nThe problem I have is, due to sheer ignorance of those who may know nothing about cars, but who has he taken advantage of with unneeded service or repairs just so he can make is upsell target?Do I talk to the service manager or just let it go?  I don't know if it is worth my time and effort.\n\nYou could try calling the GM. Who knows they might comp you something. It could be that the techs and SA are running a side show and either keeping the tires for themselves or even worse, selling them on the used market. I don't believe those tires would get thrown away.\n\nEngine flush? What an idiot! Call GM and complain bcs. other people.\n\nThe best thing you can do is to see if you can fill out a survey from bmw somewhere. These dealers live off those surveys. If you have extra time go on Yelp, google and leave reviews there too.\n\nI always say the squeeky wheel gets the grease. The GM will be accommodating even if he's in on the cheat. He doesn't want BMW NA on his ass.\n\nGive them a 1 on the survey.\n\nSo as a new SoCal M2 owner, I'm guessing I should avoid Long Beach and Buena Park dealerships?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byLastBastion1005So as a new SoCal M2 owner, I'm guessing I should avoid Long Beach and Buena Park dealerships?Couldnt say. I am just sharing my own experiences and opinions. If I do go back to Buena Park BMW, I will ask for a different advisor. I might give McKenna BMW a try next time my car needs scheduled maintenance for warranty purposes.\n\nSadly some of these SAs are on commission plus a very small salary.  My SA here in Sarasota, FL told me that if they don't hit their target for upsales their salary gets decreased.  These dealerships are becoming unfriendly to customers.  And by the way, we are CUSTOMERS, not guests !\n\nForget the dealership, just send it to BMWNA. You could probably return that tire to Tire Rack and they’d assume it’s brand new.Also, if my car needed an alignment at 5k miles, my expectation is that it’s done under warranty.",

    "content": "Hi all,So what are some things to take into account when storing a car for 2+ years?Think of the tyres, the suspension, the paint, rubbers, seals, gaskets, fluids, lines, hoses etc.What to do with the battery? Wheels on or off? The car on jackstands? Should the brakes be under pressure or not? Should you have a dehumidifier in the car?Any tips?Thank you!\n\nI've only stored for 6 months but my 2 cents are:Disconnect battery, take off wheels and store on jack stands, fill up tank and use a fuel stabilizer.And obviously use a good cover.Wondering if anyone on here has stored for that long and can give you more details.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byHunterHofmanHi all,So what are some things to take into account when storing a car for 2+ years?Think of the tyres, the suspension, the paint, rubbers, seals, gaskets, fluids, lines, hoses etc.What to do with the battery? Wheels on or off? The car on jackstands? Should the brakes be under pressure or not? Should you have a dehumidifier in the car?Any tips?Thank you!1) Tires should be inflated to operating pressures, and resting on flat stoppers to avoid flat spotting. Generally winter storage for around 6 months is really getting to pushing a tire's ability to rebound from flat spotting - so people generally rotate the tires to avoid it sitting on one patch of rubber for too long, so 2 years would way too long to let a tire just sit. So imo for a 2 year storage flat stoppers are a must.2) Suspension - imo it is better to leave a car resting on its suspension, having a car on jack stands and having the strut being stretched out likely isn't good for it since it was designed to be compressed essentially forever - as cars sit on their struts forever. Having it stretched out can induce corrosion on the shaft if in a really humid environment - although this is really unlikely.3) No brake pressure, because this can cause the pads to sieze to the rotors, also having the rubber brake lines to be cosntantly under pressure is not a good thing. As long as your calipers are properly bled you will be fine.4) No real need for a dehumidifier in the interior so long as it is not in a super humid environment.5) Otherwise fresh fluids in a standard oil service, battery tender, close all vents and plug the exhaust, cover the car and you should be good.Also put plenty of pest repellent around the car incase you have rodents in your area because they can eat wiring harnesses.\n\nThank you both, very good info. Happy to hear of more tips & tricks from others\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byHunterHofmanThank you both, very good info. Happy to hear of more tips & tricks from othersOh and also like the other user said, full tank of gas until it is about to over flow, this way moisture will not enter the fuel tank and cause issues. Fuel stabilizer will help as well, I prefer stabil fuel stabilizer. In terms of fuel try to get ethanol free gas so moisture absorption doesn't occur during the 2 years of sitting.\n\nRather than pump gas and stabilizer it would be much better to simply fill with a more stable gas.  VP  C9 or similar.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZL9M2Rather than pump gas and stabilizer it would be much better to simply fill with a more stable gas.  VP  C9 or similar.VP C9 is $80 per 5 gallons iirc, you need 52L to fill up the tank so 15 gallons is needed as they sell in multiples of 5 gallons. This means you need 3 barrels at $80 a barrel you would pay $240 to fill up the car. and regardless of fuel type, in 2 years you will have oxidation in the fuel rendering it garbage.This is not a cost effective solution at all, if your goal is to keep the fuel system saturated and prevent moisture from entering the loop and causing issues. Fuel stabilizer + pump gas is the best option. Then in 2 years you can just drain the tank and pump in fresh fuel for a fraction of the cost.\n\nI don't believe VP will oxidize in 2 years, but that's just what VP has told me.  Pump gas will turn to varnish no matter how much stabilizer you add over that timeframe.  We spend $240 for one tire on these cars...  I'd call $240 on storage fuel money well spent.  But that's my opinion, I respect yours.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZL9M2I don't believe VP will oxidize in 2 years, but that's just what VP has told me.

But that's my opinion, I respect yours.That depends on how full the tank is filled, because if you have a near empty tank the gas will volitilize easier leaving varnish behind. If your tank is near full the headspace for volitilization is smaller making it harder and thus slower to volitilize and leave varnish behind. Generally 1-2 years will be fine on a full tank of fuel, any longer and issues will occur. IIRC stabil was tested for 2 year fuel storage.Also any fuel will made of hydrocarbons will eventually volitilize and leave varnish behind, so even with c9 that'll still happen to an extent.So it is better to run pump gas and just drain the tank after storage, then run some fuel system cleaner for the next tank or two of gas right after.\n\nI would not leave regular gas in anything for 1-2 years.  But that's just me.",

    "content": "Fully stock, unmodded car.  I had a money shift earlier this year that resulted in a full engine replacement by the dealer.  Since the replacement, I have had a CEL for the cat -which the dealer is telling me will require a cat replacement to fix.  I decided to get an second opinion at a local independent shop, where the following two error codes were logged:180001 - Catalytic converter: efficiency below limit value (intermittent), and120308 - Charging pressure control, plausibility Pressure too low (intermittent)The local shop visually checked and found nothing wrong, but found that the car had an older integration, so updated it and cleared the codes (while charging me nearly $400...(secondary question, was I gouged?)).  Two days later and the CEL for the cat has popped up again.Having just moved across country, I sadly do not have the necessary tools to properly investigate this myself, so I am at the mercy of using the dealer or local shop to diagnose/fix this.  That said, I am humbly asking for any advice as to the cause and solution to what could be wrong before I dump more money into testing/replacing stuff.1.  Assuming the cat is damaged, would continuing to drive the car cause damage to the turbo (as indicated by the 120308 code)?2.  What is the most reliable/accurate way to diagnose what the actual problem is with the car?  IE, could one of these faults be causing the other?3.  With limited tools, what can I do myself to diagnose this problem?  I have done a visual inspection as best I can and saw nothing obvious.Any help is appreciated!",

    "title": "Battery Tenders / Long Term Storage",
    "content": "I'm planning an extended trip. I've seen here and there on the forums that if you are going to leave one of these cars for any long period of time, that it is a good idea to leave a battery tender on it to keep the battery health.I've read that the battery in these cars are crazy expensive, and if I use the wrong charger it can destroy the battery, and they are something like $1200 to replace. I have a battery tender for my Ducati, and a Dewalt charging station that I've used on another car of mine, but I'm not sure what makes these chargers safe or not safe to use on this car.\n\nVery good question.  It must have the ability to maintain the charge, not just charge continuously.  Also, must have the ability to charge AGM type batteries.Here is a solid recommendation for a \"smart\" battery charger.CTEK (56-864) MUS4.3 12 Volt Fully Automatic 8 Step Battery ChargerSo, this will get you in the right direction.  The cool thing with our BMW's is that you can charge from under the hood...and not the truck (where the battery actually lives)...biz\n\n+1 for the CTEK unit.  I've been using it on my GT4 during the wintertime.  What convinced me?  Finding the Porsche's battery dead after a few weeks of sitting.  Where's the battery?  In the front trunk.  How do you open the front trunk to access the battery to recharge it?  An ELECTRIC switch next to the driver's seat.  A switch that won't open the front trunk when the battery is dead.  Turns out I had to connect an external power source to a special metal connector in the fuse box to be able to open the front trunk with a dead battery.  Then I had to jump start the car with jumper cables, because the roadside assistance guy's battery charger didn't have the required juice to restore the Porsche battery.  The official \"Porsche Roadside Assistance\" guy turned out to be a local third-party guy who had never dealt with this type of situation before.  I googled it and we figured it out together.  Nice enough guy, but he had no clue.  Not very reassuring, Porsche.So get a quality battery maintainer like the CTEK.  Well worth the money!\n\nthanks for the replies. I'll start looking into ctek. I went and looked at the battery. it's some massive lithium ion laptop looking thing. I absolutely do not want to piss away money fixing that. much less finding myself locked out of my car because of it.\n\nIt's not a \"lithium ion laptop battery thing,\" it's a pretty standard (for German cars) AGM battery. There's \"a thing\" attached to the top that is part of the SOC (state of charge) monitoring system, and somewhere in all the mess there will be a pyrotechnic charge that fires in the event of a severe accident (this is the battery disconnect system since it isn't up under the hood like in most cars).They are still not cheap batteries, plus if you want to not prematurely kill the replacement battery, you need to have the dealer do the swap (or someone who has access to Rheingold so they can run the \"new battery who dis\" procedure on the car's software). This dance is required because the car \"learns\" the battery's characteristics over time and adjusts charge voltage based on temperature and other factors. If you just change out a dead battery for a new one, but don't \"reset\" this table of learned charging factors, you end up killing the new battery much more quickly since the car ends up overvolting it (new battery doesn't need as much voltage to charge as the old one did).The CTek chargers are solid, as are the actual \"Battery Tender\" brand. Just hook your tender of choice up to the posts under the hood - do NOT try to attach directly to the battery, as this would bypass any protection in the car and is the opposite of what you want to do.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeIt's not a \"lithium ion laptop battery thing,\" it's a pretty standard (for German cars) AGM battery.

I have a bit of a dilemma. I live in a condo in downtown, and I don't have access to an electrical outlet. Considering the various battery sub-systems you've mentioned, I'm guessing I can't take the battery out and run the tender out of my condo unit (or anywhere else for that matter)?For everyone else looking for the specific CTEK mentioned above, apparently it's been replaced by a successor, the CTEK 40-206 MXS 5.0-12 Volt Battery Charger. This is according to various reviews/answers on Amazon. I believe one of said reveiewers called CTEK to confirm, but you might want to do the same to be sure.\n\nI personally use a ctek multi us 7002 for my personal '17 m2 which has an AGM battery.

They should mostly (if not fully?) figure that out when you hook it back up to the car though.The concern about attaching the tender directly to the battery is only a concern if the battery is still in the car.

This approach is not ideal as it'll charge the battery more than the IBS would.Correct, damage only occurs if you attach a charger directly the the battery itself if it's in the car. This is because it bypasses the IBS and can over charge the battery. Also if you're not using a voltage stable battery tender the pulses in the current delivery can damage the IBS itself.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceEdit- I didn't read the previous post correctly.Correct, but you don't necessarily need to remove it, of you do make sure you're using a battery tender that can monitor voltage vs. a standard battery charger.

I am trying to find out if I damaged the battery or IBS. Any idea on how to check?Yeah this is pretty common, and when I was new to this platform I did it on my m235i as well. Since it was with my CTEK mus 7002 it was fine as it was microprocessor controlled and monitors voltage, and comes with a low ripple rating to prevent electronic damage. Zero issues with the battery as it was never over charged (had the car for a couple of years and zero problems with that battery even in the winter), and IBS had zero issues as diagnosed below.1) This is the most important one, but what charger did you use? If you used a low ripple charger that is microprocessor controlled to not over charge then the chance of damage to the IBS is literally almost zero. If you used a really crappy charger the chances of damage are higher, and if you jump started the car you have an extremely high chance of frying the IBS. If your charging and jump started had a surge or alot of sparking then there is a huge chance your IBS is dead.In most cases the battery will be absolutely fine, unless your charger doesn't stop charging and just keeps force feeding the battery.2) To check if everything is ok here is what you should do:a) For the IBS check ISTA, if ISTA doesn't show any codes and can stilll report a battery voltage that matches what your multi meter reads (while the car is in accessory mode) you should be fine. There are also ISTA diagnostic procedures to check if the IBS is ok as well, and you can run that.But if no errors are reported the IBS is fine. Also check it to see if there is any physical damage.b) For the battery check it with a multi meter is the voltage within normal range? If yes you are ok. Then check the physical shape of the battery - is it warped or swollen, are the terminals damaged? if not you should be fine. The battery should be the toughest part of the system and if it didn't blow up, catch on fire, or warp/bulge, and or melt from over charging and surging you are fine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceYeah this is pretty common, and when I was new to this platform I did it on my m235i as well.

    "title": "Changing out spark plugs",
    "content": "Hi all,Can I hear your thoughts on changing the spark plugs on my M2?So, my M2 currently is 4 years old and has done 15k kilometers (9k miles). Would it be a good time to have the spark plugs changed, and if so, which ones should I get?Having said that, the car has the following upgraded parts:CSF intercoolerFTP chargepipeFTP boostpipeMST turbo inlet pipeMST cold air intakeThe software and downpipe of the car are stock.Again, happy to hear your thoughts on changing out the spark plugs.Thanks!HunterHofman\n\nI'd say unless you have a specific reason to think the spark plugs need to be replaced, I wouldn't bother. I believe they aren't due for replacement until 30K miles. Maybe a bit sooner for a tuned car.\n\n15,000 miles at a minimum, and as stated, more like 30K normally.\n\nBMW Canada's service interval I guess was 50,000KM or 3 years for the spark plugs, they were changed for me at the 3 year mark when I took it in for the oil and filter changes (that was despite being at around 30,000KM).\n\nI would go with the stock bosch plugs and stock gap, no need to go to a colder plug unless you are making crazy power (Gtr's use the same heat range plugs as the stock ones and they're fine up to 700 whp) so keep an eye on your plugs to see if they are running too hot and if you need to go colder but chances are you won't need to. Stock gap should be fine up to 450 whp or more (m4 gts and m2cs are running the same plug and gap as us and they're making around this power level without issue). If you notice a misfire then you can start to gap down.So don't start gapping down for no reason because it can induce harsh idles and stutters.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceI would go with the stock bosch plugs and stock gap, no need to go to a colder plug unless you are making crazy power (Gtr's use the same heat range plugs as the stock ones and they're fine up to 700 whp) so keep an eye on your plugs to see if they are running too hot and if you need to go colder but chances are you won't need to.

So getting colder plugs wouldn't hurt/negatively affect anything right? Although unnecessary: if it can't hurt, then might as well right?Hurt no, but possibly cause a rough idle due to incomplete combustion maybe. But the good thing is that these cars aren't super sensitive to plug heat ranges from what I see (they're more gap sensitive). So if you must you can get colder plugs just keep stock gap and don't just gap to 0.020\", gap down sparingly and only if needed (stock gap should be absolutely fine even on stage 2+ maps, but if it's not go down in small incriments).Although keep in mind I think it's a huge waste of money to go with a colder plug for no reason because ngks are $20/plug and the oem Bosch plugs are $6/plug. So over 3x more for no gains or benefits at all (untill you're making significant power).\n\nRunning a colder plug without the added heat from more power will just foul the plugs faster. No difference in performance though.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceQuote:Originally Posted byHunterHofmanThanks for your reply.

First he asks me to \"bring it in, we'll look at it\". Wut? I asked him if there's some way to visually confirm they changed the filter, tell me what they're going to \"look at\" and I'll look at it. Eventually he talks to the tech, who is no help. You'd THINK he could ask a simple question like \"would you EVER do an oil change w/o doing the filter too, perhaps you just neglected to add it to the invoice?\", but that apparently didn't happen. So I'm doing an interim change this week at 6500, will do the 10k service there again, then between official 10k-intervals, will continue to do a 5k change on my own, which is my normal regimen.Maybe the mysterious wiper blade change was actually the filter, but wrong part number input by someone? Nobody knows, and nobody gives a crap. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it, at least the oil was drained, and I'd think/hope that any further debris would continue to stay suspended/caught in the original filter.\n\nIt's almost laughable how incompetent dealers can be sometime.I suspect you may be right re the wiper part #You could pull the filter out & inspect or just change it w/o doing the oil again.\n\nI think the folks here are correct.

However unless you're in a really hot country like Australia then your dealer might not stock 5w30 in their barrels and convincing them to use the bottles during the oil change especially when the m2 calls for 0w30 is highly unlikely. Especially since not many dealers are willing to look through ista for approvals, and this will make warranty a nightmare as well. So generally unless you live in a hot country or have a cool dealer that'll let you swap to 5w30 (also not ///m oil) then you got 0w30 ll01fe, which is used on all other bmw models except the new b58 where they're going even thinner for emissions (thicker oil = more parasitic loss) which is dumb as hell.Also the old 0w40 m power oil is no longer approved iirc, so if you force the dealer to use those bottles - again highly unlikely they'll do it since it most likely will not be covered under warranty by bmw and thus they'll have to pay for it, or if you decide to pay for it. Then you risk getting denied warranty in the future as well.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///M TOWNUnrealWhen did all this happen?2016 iirc, this is when they stopped approving/making 0w40 m power oil. This is when they worked with shell.However it was not all bad, iirc the tpt 5w30 shell made oil is even better than the 0w40 m power oil, and it wasn't even close. So you could always request or buy that, but people don't recognize this as they only think higher weight = better oil but that's not always true.But, now a days with Castrol once again making the oil idk if 5w30 is good anymore. Because shell really pushed the limits of oil tech with their 5w30 and I really don't know if Castrol can compare. Only time will tell.Either way my advice is while under warranty stay with bmw approved oils, and be fine with the 0w30 oil they're using now adays. No point fighting for 5w30 anymore since we don't know if it's worth it. Then when warranty is over ditch all that bmw oil and get some good aftermarket oil like PPE 5w40/qse 5w40, or motul xcess gen 2 5w40, and even Castrol edge 0w40 or 0w30.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceQuote:Originally Posted by///M TOWNUnrealWhen did all this happen?2016 iirc, this is when they stopped approving/making 0w40 m power oil.

I lived in San Diego and know climate and I ran 0W30. I lived in Alabama, much hotter, and still ran 0W30.Your oil temperature is maintained by cooling system, and cooling system n M2 is excellent.You are also at pretty much sea level. Altitude is much worse for engines when it comes to cooling bcs. thinner air means less heat exchange between radiator and surrounding. It is easier on an engine in the Death Valley in summer than Vail pass here in CO in summer.So, heat? Absolutely no worries whatever you run LL01 or for that matter any Euro oil.Cold start? The difference between 0W or 5W oils matter somewhere around -30c. I started my engines (X5 35d) here in CO at -44c using Valvoline 5W40.From that stand point, absolutely don't worry.Castrol 0W30/40 are good bcs. they are very shear stable, especially for 0W oils (the wider the spread between XW and WXX more shear. That is countered with high quality base stocks like PAO and POE. So, from production stand point making 5W30 and 5W40 is easier to make than 0W30 or 0W40. But Castrol has very low shear, lower than most 5W30/40 oils and very low evaporation loss (Noack). That is bcs. Castrol 0W30/40 are loaded with PAO (very low pour point indicates A LOT of true synthetic base stock, and it is -60).So, you will be served well with this oil and in LA don't worry about ambient temperature.I bet your dad would be interesting guy to talk to regardless of subject.\n\nThank you, very much appreciate your insight on all this.  my parents were incredible and you are right, he kept current and was a blast to engage on any subject.  my mom was a concert pianist.  they were both incredible.  they were both from chicago and we moved to LA when I was young. life is bittersweet\n\nyou make an impression + I don't want to deal with 5 qt bottles, I ended up just getting the 0/30 at walmart.  thx again for your time\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2LAyou make an impression + I don't want to deal with 5 qt bottles, I ended up just getting the 0/30 at walmart.  thx again for your timeWal Mart has 0W30?Online?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolMB229.5 is in general more stringent specification.

It is non issue if timing chain is done correctly and on N/S55 it is done properly.Very interesting, I have been running PP Euro 5w40 in my 2001 525i as I thought it was one of the best oils out there from my readings but sounds like at least in some ways Castrol Edge may be the better bet.\n\nThere's another alternative too if you want LL01 like me (I don't want to take chances on the timing chain despite it being built properly, and the valvetronic system relies on oiling as well and these things have been shown to be problematic on some cars with the worm gear wearing prematurely). But overall listen to edy, the guy taught me everything I know (and I know almost nothing compared to him) about oil on BITOG.https://www.motul.com/ca/en/products...ess-gen2-5w-40https://bobistheoilguy.com/forums/th...-5w-40.336438/It has a solid HTHS of 3.8, higher levels of Zinc compared to PPE, Porsche A40 and MB229.5 approvals as well.The problem with this oil however is price (it's kind of on the expensive side compared to PPE and Castrol which are known to go on sale for 50% off very frequently), and availability (this is readily available in Lordco in Canada, I don't know about the US).I'm thinking about moving from PPE 5W40 this oil, but we will see - it's still fairly new and I haven't seen a UOA yet.\n\nFill it with what BMW recommend maybe?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyFill it with what BMW recommend maybe?bmw recommends FE oils which aren't that good. But they also recommend LL01 oils which can be really good. So you have to make sure you select the right one despite bmw recommending oils.Personally I am using PPE 5w40, but thinking about motul xcess gen 2 5w40. I am still unsure if the benefits will be worth it because it costs alot more, and since my oci is quite low flash point retention of PPE isn't a huge concern for me. Zinc seems to be in the 900-990 ppm range which is only slightly lower than motul at 1099 ppm and castrol which is in the same range. So is it worth it for me to spend alot more for minimal to no gains idk. But castrol is out of the picture for me since it is really hard for me to find the correct version of 0w40 locally.\n\nAlso with oil formulations change so rapidly, and new oil analysis may reveal new details for oils that what is recommended today may not be recommended for tomorrow, so the suggestions always are dynamic and forever changing.So if you want to avoid the headaches just buy the cheapest LL01 oil you can find and you will most likely be fine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2LAHiValvoline vs Pennzoil vs M1 vs CastrolReading through some of these posts answers the question of why I drink as much as I do lol.  2017 M2 manual.

I made a mistake before saying BMW TPT oil was good, the 0W30 is okish, but the 5W30 is really good because the 5w30 is LL01 and 0W30 is LL01 FE.So either get tpt 5w30 that is LL01 only, or move to an aftermarket oil.\n\nIt's not junk, and it will be fine unless you track the car regularly. BMW was filling S65 with 10W-60 until 2013. If it were going to be a real issue, it would not have been approved for S55 and the manual would not have been updated. People read BITOG for 5 minutes and think they know more than BMW, or exaggerate the minutiae, at least. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to suggest that you don't know what you are talking about, but I think the difference is overblown. Maybe non FE is better in the long run or severe service, but there is nothing about the 0W-30 that screams dangerously inadequate.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719It's not junk, and it will be fine unless you track the car regularly.

Maybe non FE is better in the long run or severe service, but there is nothing about the 0W-30 that screams dangerously inadequate.I'm not saying it's dangerous to use FE oils but it is not optimal compared to non FE oils. There is also speculation that FE oils could have been a reason for increased bearing wear on these engines along with the potential of exacerbating rod bearing failures.BTW Edycol is one of the highest rated members from BITOG and worked in certifying oils.... So he knows what he's talking about....\n\nAfter spending a long time following the S54, S65, and S85 bearing issues, I would say that any speculation about oil affecting the bearing wear is just that. People ran every oil you can imagine in those engines and they still had abnormal bearing wear. I think you really need to know the root cause, because it may not be helped or mitigated by higher HTHS.Yep, I have seen his posts on BITOG.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719After spending a long time following the S54, S65, and S85 bearing issues, I would say that any speculation about oil affecting the bearing wear is just that.

So depending on how your car is driven oil changes can come sooner or later.Now despite the fact that oil doesn't absorb water (moisture can still be present in oil just not absorbed into it, but with the presence of water the oil will become milky and that is really bad as well) it oxidizes over time so oil shouldn't be used past the 1 year mark. Also if you have alot of water in your oil you'll have to change it as well.Note 5,000km is around the beginning stages of when you should normally change your oil if you want your car to last, bmw's standard service interval is much too long.

Remember oil is cheap engines are not, so change your oil frequently it is the cheapest insurance you can get for your car.There is a lot of info missing there.1) there is no oil quality sensor, only an oil life algorithm. This works on heat put in the oil, length of journeys and time since last oil change.The manual says to do an oil change every XKm or 2 years, whichever comes first. It is now just going by the age of the oil.2) Unless all your drives are under 30min long you do not need to worry about water in the oil. The oil gets to 120c in normal conditions, enough to evaporate all of the water in the oil.If you get Mayo you have a bigger issue or have been only driving short journeys. A long drive will sort this.3) Oil health and miles are related but not the be all connection. 5000km on track will have a different oil wear to 5000km doing 100kmh on the highway. The reason Americans change their oil more often is (in my opinion) partly cultural (quick lube propaganda) and because of their shit fuel with more sulfur that will acidity the oil sooner than say EU fuel.I would change the oil, it's cheap to do and ensures it's good. This is a high performance turbo car, it needs good oil to live a long life.If you don't track I would follow what the car says. If you do track then change it more often. The only way to know for certain you have the \"right\" interval is to have the oil tested.Not big in the EU (for cars, boats it's more common) but there are some companies popping up to do it.\n\n5,000km is just just over 3,100 miles.Noting that some parts of BMW Europe mandate 2 year intervals for oil service, It may be that you can safely leave it another 12 months based on the distance travelled.Obvs. if those were 5,000km of trackdays (or you've been 'visiting friends' in southern Germany on a regular basis), change the oil and filter as it won't hurt, and is cheap compared to the cost of pretty much any repairs.\n\nHigh grade oil and an oil filter was only €70 and I will do the work myself so no biggyI guess better safe than sorry...\n\nSo, left hand lane all the way on the autobahn then?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftySo, left hand lane all the way on the autobahn then?Unfortunately notBelgium is limited to 120 km/h\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMacFeverUnfortunately notBelgium is limited to 120 km/hHence the reference to Germany...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMacFeverHigh grade oil and an oil filter was only €70 and I will do the work myself so no biggyI guess better safe than sorry...Absolutely unnecessary.

My SA (great guy) shared that BMW does a wheel hub alignment for cars with electric steering instead of a wheel alignment in order to get the most precise alignment possible.Can anyone shed more light on this? Is it worth nearly 3x the price if I can't find an Indy shop that can do the same for a more reasonable price?\n\nIf it's a BMW dealership, they will be doing a full 4-wheel alignment, including the rear camber. And it will use the BMW KDS (made by Hunter) system - which can be seen in operation on YouTube - but appears to mount to the wheels.BMW hourly workshop rates are always going to be higher than an independent, as they have to pay for all those front of house staff (such as your SA) somehow.HTH\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyIf it's a BMW dealership, they will be doing a full 4-wheel alignment, including the rear camber.

Does this system provide significant benefits compared to what you'd find at an Indy?At the end of the day the machine doesn't matter so much, the operator makes the difference.It's very very hard to be accurate to .0X degrees as the alignment will change ever so slightly as you tighten up the bolts. Also there is a bunch of squishy rubber in the suspension.

Per seller, he has not replaced it, so Im assuming its an original pipe.  When I removed the sensor from the charge pipe, I noticed a few small pieces of plastic stuck to it.  No idea where they wouldve come from.Should I be worried if any other small pieces have already been sucked into the engine?\n\nPhotos of the debris.  They definitely felt like small pieces of plastic when I removed them.\n\nWell, plastic is unlikely to be more than additional carbon deposits in the combustion chamber. The question is more where did said plastic fragments come from?\n\nThat’s what I’m curious about.  Is it possible they may have come from a broken charge pipe?

Although very minimal (negligible imho), it would indeed be better to prime the oil filter as well, however there was still a little bit of oil left in the oil filter housing (can't be seen on video), so it was kind of primed after all when refitting it.The jack and 2 jack stands were all the tools that I had available, I will be buying a quick jack (or ramps) at some point! The drain plug, however, was relatively far down and on the back side of the sump; the slight angle it was on wasn't an issue at all I think (but yes, having it flat would be better, strictly speaking).Good point on the part numbers, I'll include them in the description!

If you really want to you can dunk your filter in oil and fill the housing with oil. However the oil filter housing drains to the sump extremely quickly without the cap there so if you're slow to screw in the cap the priming is for nothing.\n\nWhere did you locate those jack stands?Thanks for posting the video.

They also said they changed the friction modifier package alot, so it made me worried it was also designed to satisfy the + FM requirements of the e9x cars so I'm not too keen on it.Bmw is still making saf-xj in the us, iirc the manufacturer dates are still new on these bottles.

This will prevent the O-ring from binding, pinching/tearing, or rolling up and causing a leak. This is a large reason why some cars experience leaks.2) Do not break bolts with a torque wrench. For viewers with click type mechanical torque wrenches, even if you set the torque wrench to the maximum setting so it doesn't click you are still wearing the internal spring mechanism out as you are still causing it to deform while loosening the bolt. This will cause the torque wrench's calibration to become more and more inaccurate over time as the spring mechanism wears out (hence why after a certain amount of clicks you must recalibrate), this is the same type of wear that your torque wrench experiences while in normal operation however you don't want to accelerate its wear by using it to breaking bolts, tightening bolts, and especially yielding bolts. Instead use a ratchet or breaker bar for this task.For a digital torque wrench i'm not sure if it must be recalibrated after use, but I still wouldn't risk additional wear and tear on the electronics by using it to break the bolts.3) I think your diff oil is quite dirty, it came out nearly black with alot of silver metal shavings (from the gears and likely clutch pack) with no golden color left - I think you should shorten your diff oil change interval since these diffs are quite sensitive. If you want it to last do the changes more frequently and let the diff warm up via gentle driving for a bit before beating on the car.Otherwise no other comments, good video overall - quick and concise.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceQuote:Originally Posted byHunterHofmanHi all,Made a quick and simple video on how to change your differential oil:Hope this helps any of you and look forward to your comments/input!Best,The HunterHofmanGood video but here's a few nit picky things.1) The most critical thing is that you must lube the o-rings on the fill and drain bolts.

I usually never use my torque wrench as a breaker bar, but thanks for the headsup.Finally, that car has had its differential oil flushed at the run-in service (1200 miles) in December 2018 and the car now has almost done 10,000 miles.

So yeah that should be fine to run that mileage on the fluid. I'm just surprised how dark it is, I mean it is a diff so there's supposed to be alot of metallic wear from the clutch packs. But wow it's quite dirty, however at that mileage I'm sure it is fine.I wouldn't however do the bmw recommended service interval of 50k miles or 5 years though, that would be way too many miles. I think max 40k km or 4 years whatever comes first. Of course if you track alot you'll need to change fluids frequently too.",

So imo if you want the car to last I would do every 4 years or ~40,000 km whatever comes first (essentially half of bmw's recommended range).Me personally I do it every 4 years because I don't drive enough to hit the mileage requirements.I don't have a dct so I have no clue about range and intervals as I didn't look it up. But I would also do it every 4 years or 40,000 km just like the diff (I use the same intervals for my 6mt). I also believe the dct has a filter which you may need to change as well.",

Sure enough, the headlights were aiming lower, but they're still WAY TOO STRONG. The road signs are still extremely bright, and turning on the high beams lights up everything like it's day. So I parked the car in the garage and turned on the regular lights - they were difficult to look at from about 15 meters away, and to me they really did seem way too strong, both left and right headlight.What could the dealership have possibly done while replacing the headlight to make such a mess? Is it possible they had to \"reset the settings\" or something and the settings defaulted to pre-LCI lights, so now LEDs are getting to much curent / voltage?In any case, I'm going to another dealership tomorrow morning (currently in Berlin - oh what a joy it is to travel with a \"broken\" car), and I'll see what they have to say, but I'm interested to hear what people here think it could be.\n\nI hope you figure this out, as I'd like to mess up my car that way",

    "content": "I bought my 2015 M235i from a North Haven CT dealership 50 miles from me and was very impressed and pleased with the service there during the three years I owned the car.  I bought the 2021 M2C from Rallye BMW 125 miles away in Long Island NY.  I liked that dealership as well, but it is too far to go for service.This week the M2C was due for the 1200 mile run-in service.  I made an appointment with the dealership in North Haven and drove an hour to bring it in and waited while the service was done.  Everything was great as expected - oil, filter, and rear axle fluid all changed and the run-in service reminder cleared.  As well as a white glove treatment with plastic covers on the seat and steering wheel and a paper floor mat when I got back in the car.There is a BMW dealership 7 miles from me that's a 10 minute drive.  I have a couple BMW friends, including an M2C owner, who take their cars to this dealership and are satisfied with the service there.  I considered it as well, but in the end I chose the dealership an hour away because of my familiarity and trust with them.  Secondly, the dealership in North Haven is an M Certified Center, while the dealership close by is not.Is it being too OCD to only trust an M Certified Center with an M car?This is the dealership I went with for service.https://www.bmwofnorthhaven.com/m-certified-center/\n\nFrom what I understand, this is more of a sales focused program. The CAs go to SC for some driving and extra training on the M products and the dealership puts out a dedicated display. I don’t think it affects service much from what I’ve read. Especially not routine service. I’d feel comfortable getting fluid changes etc. anywhere.\n\nAgree with Chris above. My rather \"smallish\" dealer in a larger 5 dealerships in the area keeps his  tech's all well trained. And just no problem from a diagnosis on a trouble area, or fluids and PM's. Now I have spent time building a relationship with whole team over the years; they know me how careful we are with my wife's X3, our Z4 and the M2. I would go close...that's easy peasy when needed, and build a relationship. That goes a loooong way.\n\nYeah, there's a difference - they get to post a sign that says \"M Certified\". That's probably about it.",

So I suggest you call the dealership that you use for servicing and inquire about the recall. If it is legit they will tell you so and then at that point book and appointment and come in to get it fixed. Also make sure you ask about any fees - if it is a recall it will obviously be free and of course do not pay over the phone.",

Maybe it isn't that much better if better at all.IIRC base stock was more stout though.\n\nLooking at your PPE 5w40 VOA (https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1840235), PPE has more Moly by quite a bit although below 100 ppm, more boron, alot more magnesium, and more phosphorous. It also has alot less calcium and just a tiny bit less zinc.Looking at PPE vs. Motul in terms of anti wear additives: PPE has alot more moly and a tiny bit more phosphorous while being a bit behind in zinc vs. motul. So overall I would think the PPE 5w40 has more anti wear additives overall.Looking at PPE vs. Motul  in terms of detergents/dispersants: PPE has alot more boron, nearly 50% less calcium (which is really good to reduce LSPI even though our cars don't suffer from it it is good imo to try and mitigate this on tuned cars especially), and PPE has ~70X more magnesium (I have heard it is a better detergent than calcium and it also reduces LSPI) to make up for the lack of calcium as a detergent.TBN on PPE is also higher meaning it has more additives left initially and should last longer.So imo PPE looks alot better than motul in terms of the additive package they use, not just a bit better but alot better because it is magnesium heavy instead of being calcium heavy and has more anti wear additives while while only being a bit behind in terms of zinc levels. (Oil blends always fluctuate so these numbers might not always hold true, except in the case of huge deltas in numbers).Maybe the difference between the two oils is not as big as I thought and PPE might even be better.\n\nMotul is a bit thicker as well vs PPE. If you want a real test Of which is better will need UOA from each after track day.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPackPride85Motul is a bit thicker as well vs PPE. If you want a real test Of which is better will need UOA from each after track day.Correct you will need to see use cases to accurately determine what's better. But I was comparing additive packages to see which one looked like it had a better package.Also thicker doesn't mean it's better, for instance since both have the same hths the thinner one could point at a more stout base stock because it is able to handle sheer better even though it's a thinner oil. Pour point would tell if higher grade base stock was used too if it is abjlw to flow at super low temps despite being a higher weight oil, like Mobil1 0w40 can flow even at iirc -50C or even lower, and it's true Mobil1 had alot of paos in it.\n\nZinc level is down probably to meet timing chain requirements by certain manufacturers.I wouldn't look too much into additives in VOA. UOA is more relevant if two oils compared.PPE is stout oil, but there are some issues around that oil too:1. Generally much thinner than what is advertised. But, VOA by Blackstone is not mostly dead spot as methodology is geared toward UOA.2. Flash point of PPE is always down more than other oils after 5k. It seems they have issues around GTL base stock and flash point.Both oils are from top tier manufacturers. Both will do good. What fits certain driver and exploitation should be based on UOA.",

I had done this for the brakes on my previous 228i.I found a YouTube video that shows this (not mine):I didn't remember the exact steps from when I did it but based on the video it looks like:1. Turn on car without starting engine (i.e. press start button without foot on brake)2. Wait for all dash lights to clear.3. Press & Hold odometer button until service reminder comes up.4. Use short presses to scroll through the service reminders until you get to oil change.5. Use a long press to start a reset.6. Turn off car.7. Wait a couple seconds.8.

From what I hear this is the conclusion about bmw's shadow code/freeze frame data access on an F series car:INPA doesn't work, carly doesn't work, BAV technic doesn't work, Snap-on solus (those big full function tablets) doesn't work, and ISTA doesn't show shadow codes/freeze frame data directly. This is probably because bmw wants to protect this data as it shows critical data that can be used to deny warranty like detecting tunes (wgdc, afr, boost, trims etc compared to what they should be - can be used to detect piggy backs like car always requesting more fuel when boost targets are lower than expected). It can also be used to show abuse if you got WOT alot while cold, and drifting, money shifts etc.If I am wrong how do you get freeze frame data? Because it has never been an option for me as I am lead to believe it isn't easy or at all possible to get.\n\nINPA works perfectly fine and I prefer it over ISTA. I've used it on F chassis, even on 2021 M2, and G chassis just as well.In ISTA, you have to click on the code and one of the buttons on the lower left (I can't remember off the top of my head on what it's worded like) to display the DTC freeze frame.INPA and Tool32 will still give more info about the codes.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byEnabledINPA works perfectly fine and I prefer it over ISTA.

Everything has been fine except…Today during a drive to a ppf/tint shop I started to pay attention to one particular noise that worries me a little. Let's say I am at full stop, clutch pressed and first gear in. Ready to go. Then, I start moving slowly by accelerating softly and releasing the clutch gently. This is a typical situation when parking, at traffic lights in the city, in a traffic jam, etc. The issue is that when I am releasing the clutch while accelerating, and the car starts to move, I can hear a fast paced rythmic clicking/ticking sound.Once the clutch is fully engaged it is not audible anymore, so you can only hear it when you start to move gently from full stop in first gear or when releasing the clutch in second gear when driving really slow. Basically, at urban driving when the engine starts pushing the car forward.The clutch seems to be working completely fine. The car moves really smoothly. The pedal doesn't vibrate or make strange noises. Also, if I am in neutral and press and release the clutch, nothing strange happens, no noises or vibrations. So the only problem is... that strange noise when I am starting to move. It is not something very noticeable and I think it can't be heard from outside the car. Maybe it is something normal and I'm just worrying over nothing? (My previous manual car never did this though so…..yeah)Here's a video of the noise -I put it into 1st from N and then slowly let out the clutch (releasing extra slow in the vid) as I would if moving from stand still/in traffic, etc. and as the clutch is trying to engage it is making that clicking (rattling?) noise. Same thing when going in reverse and I think going 1st to 2nd? (Harder to tell with the 1>2 shift).

We used to be able to access the service manual through newtis.info but that was shutdown by BMW recently since they decided they want to start selling their own access to the manual.I think your options now are:Get ISTA, it's the BMW tool that dealerships use and includes the TIS documents. There are other forums where you can get it, it isn't really authorized.Buy access via BMW, it's expensive and maybe not available to all countries?Buy access via a different reseller, I'm not familiar with any particular ones but have heard them recommended from YouTube but I'd want to do plenty of due diligence.The big benefit of ISTA is that if you also get the appropriate cable then you can run service plans for resetting service intervals, brake fluid purge programs etc.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymugabeBMW all service manual are available herehttps://onlypdfmanuals.com/workshop/bmwSeems like the M2 book is missing from the list John.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDoZZaSeems like the M2 book is missing from the list John.Not just that, they are mostly owner manuals, not service.\n\nHey guys, I am looking for newtis but then I remembered them shutting it down.Anyone know where one could find correct tourqe range for the M2 competition?

Right now I would like to put 5w30 or 5w40 (0w40 from BMW is not produced anymore).I live in Poland so springs and summers are hot which makes me think about 5w40.Can anyone tell me which oil should I choose? Maybe there is someone from EU who can tell me which oil uses (if I'm right because of petrol quality oil uses in USA/Canada can be different?)I will be grateful for your help\n\nI recommend pennzoil platnium euro 5w40.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byTooSoonJuniorI recommend pennzoil platnium euro 5w40.It's difficult to buy Penzoil in Poland.When I'm looking on BMW page (https://www.bmw.pl/pl/topics/offers-...silnikowe.html) they says that 5w30 LL-01, 04 and 12 FE will be good.What will be the difference between them?One more thing.

BMW for M cars is using Shell oils (in EU)(in BMW bottle) right now but that's not the oil which can be bought under Shell bottle?Bmw is now using Castrol as they switched to a new partner.You can use shell ultra helix oils (just as good if not better) instead of pennzoil since it should be easier to find in the EU.\n\nSo, forget ambient temperature in Poland. Only time Poland experience extreme temperatures might be in winter. In summer don't worry. Also, ambient temperature is not what overheats the car. It is altitude and Poland is pretty low.Someone suggested Pennzoil. Pennzoil is repackaged Shell. Shell owns Pennzoil and they bought brand not Pennzoil know-how as it wasn't on par Shell.In EU you can safely run LL04 and that oil is actually recommended. If you do track vehicle, LL01 would be better choice.My choice would be Motul 5W30 X-Clean + (+is very important). It is exceptional oil. That oil will be ok in summer or winter.If you are out of warranty, you don't have to use LL04 or LL01 oils. Use MB229.51 or MB229.5 oils. Reason is that BMW updated LL approvals to increase OCI which eliminated a lot of very stout oils that contain esters. Mobil1 ESP 5W30 is remarkable oil or Castrol 0W30 C3.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceBmw is now using Castrol as they switched to a new partner.You can use shell ultra helix oils (just as good if not better) instead of pennzoil since it should be easier to find in the EU.I am sorry, what?

Regardless of what the manual says if you buy bmw oil it's coming from Castrol again.We aren't talking after market oil we are talking bmw labeled oil. Bmw doesn't make their own oil they contract people to make it for them.\n\n<sigh> Why do you feel you need to change the oil - is the service history patchy?",

It sounds as if the front suspension is clunking.Car is my DD and no track driving yet.Hm...If you have camber plates usually clunking noise is normal.If you hear the clunking sound at full wheel turn over bumps at slow speed, it will most likely be the upper strut/mount nut/bolt that is lose.As you never have touched any suspension no modification and considering the car is relatively new, I don't think it would be the strut/mount joint problem. However, try to make full turn (left or right see if they both or one side make sound) and go over a shallow bump at low (~5 mph) speed. If it does make clunky noise, then most likely it will be strut/mount joint.If you do not hear anything, things can get trickier. Then, it is not easy to diagnose the problem without actually conducting a close inspection.Try to listen more carefully to check where the noise is coming from (driver or passenger side), if you have a lifting jack, take off the wheel and check for a bad/loose tie rod and ball joint, checked torque on all suspension bolts, checked the shock for oil leakage etc. If you find everything looks find, it also could be swaybar link.Sorry mate that I cant help much but thats all I have to say...Best way is to take her to dealership (but as yours is flashed, you might feel not good to go see dealer directly, then best way is to take her to reputable mechanic around you).\n\nAppreciate the detailed response and help. I may bring it to the dealership and get some info.\n\nCheck the things that were changed..... so you had DP installed make sure all is tight and alignment is correct and not close to anything. The exhaust moves a bit and will expand backwards when hot. Always look at what a shop touched first...something probably came loose\n\nWheel bearing.

I am using W40 so we get better understanding of an issue.40 is KV100 range! 12.5 to 16.4cst!5W is flow at certain temperature (in the case of 5W it is tested at -30c).Oil can be on various spectrum of W40 range.

Do I really need to change my brake fluid every two years?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjas1598I know the manual says brake fluid should be changed 3 years after new, and then every 2 years after. Can someone explain why this frequency is necessary? Seems excessive to me, but I've never owned a car at this price point either.I only put about 2,000 miles on the car per year and never track it. Do I really need to change my brake fluid every two years?Typically on any car it is recommended on average to be 2 years for general usage since brake fluid by nature is hygroscopic\n\nI understand, but will it really cause significant damage if I do four year intervals considering my mileage is so low? Will it really cause brake components to rust?\n\nBrake fluid does not care about mileage unless it's hard mileage (track use, or with trucks it would be towing), it makes no difference if you were driving tons of miles every year or driving 1000 miles per year. Brake fluid, because it is hydroscopic will absorb water over time so time is the only thing that matters other than extreme use.The actual brake fluid costs around $20, when I've had a shop change brake fluid I paid $100. Going over the 2 year interval is not going to rust your components in 2 years, so if you stretch the interval it will almost certainly have a negative impact on your brake system. It's unlikely that you'll see issues within 5-7 years if you extend the interval to 3 or 4 years but you likely will see issues past that and the cost to repair those issues is likely to be more expensive than the $200 you saved by extending the interval.I really don't see the point in trying to save $100 on brake fluid, if you're at the 24 month mark I wouldn't rush out to get it changed ASAP but whenever a service is done I would change it.\n\nAside from time intervals, does anyone know if the chosen fluid would really matter a lot for everyday driving for example if someone uses ATE SL compare to the Motul 600.We all know the numbers and the Castrol SRF is the best but it's also high up there in price.  In my case I can't even get that SRF locally.Does anyone know what BMW uses right @ the factory?\n\nIs the Amsoil brake fluid any good?   wet #: 410F/210c\n\nHighly recommend Motul 600.  Great fluid and not too expensive.\n\nFor everyday street driving the fluid will not really make a difference, their feel will not really be different. The difference between fluids are in wet and dry boiling points and I suppose some differences in whether the fluids might react differently to the components in the brake system over time.I haven't really heard of there being significant differences between manufacturers, I would just recommend finding a decent fluid with a high dry boiling point (since with tracking we should be changing frequently enough to never approach the wet boiling point). You can consider cost, but I'd consider availability as probably the key criteria. You do not really want to be mixing fluid, so sticking to the same fluid is advisable to avoid needing to do very thorough flushes each time.Technically BMW call for DOT4 low viscosity, rather than regular DOT4 but I'm not sure that it would make that much of a difference. I use Motul 600 during the track season and last year switched back to BMW OEM fluid over winter and have previous used a generic European DOT4 fluid in the past. It's probably overkill to change over winter.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byvrooooomAside from time intervals, does anyone know if the chosen fluid would really matter a lot for everyday driving for example if someone uses ATE SL compare to the Motul 600.We all know the numbers and the Castrol SRF is the best but it's also high up there in price.  In my case I can't even get that SRF locally.Does anyone know what BMW uses right @ the factory?Quote:Originally Posted byTooSoonJuniorHighly recommend Motul 600.  Great fluid and not too expensive.ATE Type 200 or Castrol SRF is the way I would go.  You would still have to bleed Motul 600 as often as ATE Type 200.  You can probably leave Castrol SRF in all season.  Although I will note that when I transitioned from Castrol SRF to another brake fluid, the master cylinder seems to squeal slightly over the next few changes.\n\nUnfortunately both I have no access to.  Might have to try the Amsoil route. That or Motul 600.\n\nEvery 2 years, regardless of mileage, for a non-tracked car.Any DOT4 you want if you're not tracking the car.\n\nGuys, be VERY careful with Castrol SRF.It us hydrophobic (it is hydro in this case) not hygroscopic fluid. It repels water, not absorbing like regular fluid.If one uses minimum 3ltr are necessary for first change. Reason is that if old fluid is left, SRF will isolate that fluid since it repels it. It will creat more dangerous pocket than regular fluid with high moisture content.LV fluid is necessary if vehicle driven in cold. In summer or not too cold winters, DOT4 is fine.On track there are a lot of really good choices besides SRF. RBF, TRW racing, EBC307, Brembo racing etc.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolGuys, be VERY careful with Castrol SRF.It us hydrophobic (it is hydro in this case) not hygroscopic fluid.

Can't tell it was replaced, looks like it came from the factory.Safelite replaced with oem glass for me like a week ago.\n\nAfter multiple horrific experiences with incompetent Safelite techs, I will NEVER let anyone from that company ever touch any car of mine again. Ever.OEM BMW glass is not expensive. I would hold out for it, or just pay the difference if your insurance only wants to pay for generic.\n\nOnly use OEM glass to avoid headaches.\n\nSafelite replaced mine with OEM its perfect.\n\nI have no experience with safelite, but I do know that if you have your windshield replaced by someone who isn't careful you can have big problems with corrosion later in the cars life.

Only difference is it doesn’t say “Connected Drive” which is a plus to me and it doesn’t have the BMW logo. Also fun fact: the dealership here says even if you do it there, they just contract it out to safelite. The safelite guy confirmed it too.\n\nI had my front windshield replaced at Safelite as well a few months ago, they had no issues with getting me the OEM glass.  Instead of choosing to have one of their mobile vans come over I decided to have the work done at one of their locations. Felt more comfortable having the work done their as oppose to at my apartment complex or work lol.\n\nThank you all reading your experiences have helped and I will go with BMW replacement windshield.\n\nHere's a tip for any windshield replacement on BMW.The A pillars inside the car have a wide gap so when they throw aftermarket adhesive on you will see the adhesive 90% of the time - they can't really predict how it lands because put it on in this kind of orientation /\\ and then it flattens out.Ask them to install a \"foam dam\" its a little piece black foam that will prevent the majority if not all of the black shiny adhesive to show in your car.  I went through this twice on two different cars and they had to re do the replacement.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySteelguinSafelite replaced mine with OEM its perfect.Same here, replaced mine a month ago.

They are sometimes metal and damage the paint under the glass while they are cutting the urethane. Happened to my 1999 323. Rust forming around the windshield pillars.Safelite (maybe some others IDK) use nylon rope to avoid that and also use primer whenever needed. They source OEM glass directly from a local dealer and  all of their aftermarket glass is manufactured by OE suppliers in the same plant. The manufacturing process is necessarily different because the OEM process requires mass production of a couple of part numbers while \"aftermarket replacement are made in application batches.Totally get the preferences for logged glass. Just wanted to point out the differences, at least as far as Safelite is concerned.As mentioned, dealers do not install glass but sub it out. I prefer to work with A brand that has a reputation to uphold and through my insurer recommendation in case there are issues later. Even if I had to pay a difference.My 2 cents.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byyuriydeeSame here, replaced mine a month ago.

    "title": "Sudden loss of power & rough idle",
    "content": "I had an issue with my M2 today and was hoping to get some feedback from the community.I was driving home on the expressway today, cruising along at a high rate of speed in 6th gear. Then I felt a thunk like my car had a hiccup and I had a sudden drop in power. So I slowed down and continued on the expressway. When I was off the expressway in stop and go traffic, I could feel the car wasn't running right. When I would press the accelerate pedal there was a significant lack of power and slow or hesitant acceleration. Also when shifting gears the acceleration was choppy. Sometimes power would kick in suddenly like it popped into gear.There were no check engine lights, no warnings on the dash or in idrive. Vehicle status in idrive is OK.I wasn't far, so I carefully drove it home like an old lady. When I got home I turned off the car, looked around, under, and in the engine bay and nothing visibly wrong. After a few minutes I turned the car back on and it was idling very rough. Still no warnings or lights.Due to the rough idling, I don't think it's transmission related. But I'm no mechanic, so not sure what it could be. Has anybody had an issue like this with their M2 or any ideas what it might be? Did a quick search on the forums, but could not find anything that matched my experience.My M2 is completely stock, purchased new in 2017. I only have 20,000 miles on it. It spends most of its time sitting in the garage. Never had any serious issue with my car. It's been bullet proof until now.I plan to call in the morning to get it looked at by a professional. But I'm kind of freaking out tonight worried about it. And of course my warranty ended about 2 months ago.\n\ncharge pipe?https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1778902seems to have a very similar experience then yours...bang, loss of power, rough idle\n\nThank you for the feedback. I took a look and that is exactly what happened. Dammit I'm pissed and disappointed in BMW that they would use such a flawed part on a performance car. If this part is prone to failure you would think BMW should do a recall. I checked my VIN and there are no recalls on my car. It's like it was purposely designed to last just past the 4 year warranty period.I hope I didn't hurt my engine driving it home like that, about 10 miles?Oh well... Since it has to be replaced, I guess I might as well upgrade to an aftermarket metal charge pipe, instead of replacing with the plastic OEM. Looks like VRSF, Turner, and Active Autowerke make upgrades. I'll do some more research on these.Enjoy some pics of the damage.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFroggiI hope I didn't hurt my engine driving it home like that, about 10 miles?No.\n\nSucks but at least it's ok. Def glad I put a forge CP on my car.\n\nGot a VRSF charge pipe installed a few days ago. Car is running great now.",

    "title": "Fuel-it Ethanol Content Tester",
    "content": "Introduction:In this thread I will be reviewing the Fuel-it ethanol content tester. Before we begin I have to extend a shout out to Fuel-it for giving me a discount/reimbursement to review this tester, but like always I will be writing an unbiased review.Credit:All images in this review were taken by me.Disclaimer:Any technical advice, installation instruction, or product installation, product usage tips, any form of advice provided in this review, or decision to purchase a product is done so at your own risk I will not be responsible for personal injuries, injuries to others or any living being, any damage to your car, or any property damage.Shipping:First lets talk about shipping, since I know it may be scary to have a small glass test tube be sent in the mail - since these things can be fragile. Well for this fuel tester they wrapped it in bubble wrap and shipped it within a fedex cardboard envelope that also has bubble wrap in its interior. So the fuel tester was fairly well protected and arrived to me without issue. Shipping was also pretty fast taking about a week to get to me, and processing time took about a day which is also really fast.Overview:In this section we will be looking over a few critical areas of fuel testers and how fuel-it improved on their tester to make it surpass all other fuel testers on the market, and addressed any potential issues.Importance of using an ethanol tester:With the growing popularity of OTS tunes that utilize ethanol blends like BM3 and MHD, the need to know the exact content of ethanol you use to blend becomes ever so important. This is because if you use too much ethanol your fuel trims will go too far out of range which can cause tuning issues and your HPFP can even crash. If you do not have enough ethanol due to your E85 station dispensing low concentrations of ethanol, your octane ratings can be lower than required by your tune causing knock and potentially engine failure. So it is really important to know the percentage of ethanol that your E85 station is dispensing so an affordable tool like this is extremely important.Cap Material/construction:This is an extremely important aspect of ethanol fuel testers because they must be shaken to mix the ethanol and water. So if a cap is made of unsuitable materials it can cause a leak and that will cause the percentage reading to be off (literally every drop counts) and cause a mess.Standard ethanol testers:- Utilize a cheap plastic cap either with no seal or a silicone based rubber seal.- This brings in potential issues because if a seal is not used the coarse thread design of the cap and the design utilizing very few threads can result in a leak.- If a cheap rubber or silicone seal is used the gasoline and ethanol in the e85 can make the seal swell also resulting in a leak.- This is what generally occurs with cheap ethanol content testers on the market.Fuel-it ethanol tester:- Fuel-it used to use a cheap plastic cap like what was described above and reports did have it leaking. But like what is the norm with fuel-it they listen to customer reports and strive to improve their products. So they introduced a second generation of cap which is a thin tin cap with a foam like gasket. This is similar to what a vodka bottle cap would be like and the design is completely immune to the seal swelling effects from alcohol or gasoline, and thus this cap does not leak over time like cheaper caps do.- I have tested this cap with both E88 and pure 91 octane gasoline both left in the fuel tester for a few days (upside down so the fuel would contact the cap and the foam seal) and there was no seal swelling and no leaking of any sort after that duration. So I am extremely impressed and happy with the cap design of the fuel-it tester.Credit: F87sourceCredit: F87sourceMarkings:Credit: F87sourceThe next thing to note with the fuel-it ethanol content tester is the markings on the tube itself. Unlike other cheaper testers which have inked on markings, the fuel-it ethanol content tester is laser etched into the glass test tube. This means that the fuel-it tester will not be susceptible to the markings fading over time due to the solvent nature of ethanol and gasoline (which is really good at dissolving ink markings like those found on cheaper testers).Credit: F87sourceCredit:F87sourceSo above is an image of a lab/medical grade BD syringe which is one of the most high quality syringes you can buy, unlike those cheap dollar store/amazon syringes. This is what I use to suck some ethanol out of my fuel jug to add into the ethanol tester, and as you can see just with a few exposures to e85 the markings on the side of the syringe has been washed off. This is what will eventually happen to cheaper ethanol content testers with simple printed on markings the ethanol will dissolve those markings and it will eventually fade (ethanol will also dissolve permanent marker so essentially it doesnt matter what ink you use it will all fade), making these cheaper testers a paper weight. So imo the most important thing in an ethanol content tester is the markings, because if those fade the tester is useless - therefore this laser etching alone makes fuel-its tester the best on the market as no one else is doing it.The next notable feature of the fuel-it ethanol content tester is the marking intervals. Unlike other cheaper testers which have marking intervals ever 5% or 10% in terms of ethanol content, and only covers from E50 - E85 or sometimes even less than that range. The fuel-it ethanol tester has an interval every 2.5% and goesl from E0 - E100. This is such a nice thing to have because you are able to measure nearly every single possibility of ethanol concentration you would like, for eg. E10 or E15 etc. You can also measure ethanol concentrations of E88 or E87.5 which is impossible on those other cheaper testers. This range of measurement is critical because not every gas station will provide exactly E85, there is often a large variation and the concentration will depend on the last digit which is often not a 0 or a 5 meaning those cheaper analyzers will not be able to give an accurate reading. This is another reason why the fuel-it ethanol tester is superior to the competition.The markings are also crisp, sharp (not a huge blob of a line), and easy to read which is nice when you must look at the bottom of the meniscus.Flat bottom/build/volume/Warranty:The fuel-it ethanol tester also has a nice flat bottom to the tester which allows you to stand the tube upright on your truck lid while adding in the E85 allowing you to focus on adding the precise amount and not have to focus on holding the tube.The build quality of the ethanol tester is also made of glass, this is extremely nice because it allows for a long usage life because glass is chemically inert and will not be damaged and made brittle by gasoline or ethanol.The fuel-it ethanol tester in its small size option is about 15 mL in volume, this means that you will not have to waste a ton of E85 filling up this tube and there will also not be alot of waste liquid to dispose of.This fuel tester also comes with a lifetime warranty against defects or fading, so if you ever encounter any issues you can have it replaced! This just shows their confidence in this product lasting, compared to those other cheaper testers out there.Quick Summary on how to use the fuel tester and how it works:Credit: F87sourceFirst add water to the tester, add the water until the bottom of the meniscus is at the water fill mark as denoted by the red arrow in the image above.Then add E85 to the tester until the meniscus is at the fuel line, as denoted by the orange arrow in the image above.Then cap the fuel tester and shake it until the water and E85 is mixed, the solution will be cloudy so you will have to let it sit for a bit until the solution is clear.Since the ethanol in the E85 is soluble in water and the gasoline is not, the two will separate. The ethanol will be dissolved in the water or aqueous phase which sits below the gasoline phase due to waters higher density.So the more ethanol present in the ethanol the higher the separation line will be meaning a higher ethanol reading. Simple!After the solution has settled read the ethanol concentration by looking at the separation line at eye level and looking at the bottom of the meniscus. As shown in my photo by the black arrow my E85 concentration is slightly below the E87.5 line and so it is around E87. So this is some really high quality E85 at my local station - which is known to have high E85 concentration year round even in the winter!Summary:Overall the fuel-it ethanol content tester really is the best on the market, it has a great construction, a refined cap design that doesnt leak, nice sharp easy to read markings with a great interval range, and a lifetime warranty. So if you are looking for an ethanol tester this is the one to have.\n\nReserved for future posts.",

I'd also concluded that I will likely NOT need a brake job before it would have expired, and without getting a full brake job out of the plan, it's not a good buy.My question is this - at the end of the 3/36 included maintenance that comes with the car, will I be offered a maintenance plan extension by BMW?

On tracked cars it is also common for the fluid near and inside the caliper to be heat-damaged and darkened moreso than what is up in the reservoir.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMaynardQuote:Originally Posted byedycolFlyid itself is hygroscopic.

In Europe they test fluid for each technical inspection for registration.Track fluid needs to be changed often. I change it 2-3 times during track season. But, we are talking fluid. Pressure changes will mix fluid. Also, fluid is on the move as pads are worn out.",

    "content": "Hey everyone, I'm trying to figure out if I got ripped off by my local service center. I have a 2017 M2 with 13k miles. I bought it used a year ago, and this is my first BMW, so it was my first experience with them.My car said routine service was due so I took it in. The rep scanned the key fob and said he recommended changing the spark plugs. The estimate was $1200 parts and labor. I couldn't understand how it could be so expensive, or even necessary after so few miles. He replied that they recommend changing plugs after every third oil change, and that hard driving can require early replacement. My alarm bells were ringing, but I figured the previous owner could have tracked the car. So, I said it was okay if they took a look at the forward plugs (which he said were more accessible), and get visual confirmation on their state.Explaining the cost, he said it was a 4 hour job due to the need to remove the intake manifold to access the rear plugs, plus $240 in parts.A few hours later he called back to say they did indeed recommend replacing the plugs. I said okay. When I picked the car up, parts + labor for the plug replacement was $1088. He said he saved some time on the labor, so it was a little less than the $1200 estimate.I feel like a may have been a sucker here. But it was my first BMW service center experience, and at the time his explanation seemed plausible.I did manage to get a couple of the old plugs from him and have attached a picture.Basically I have three questions:1) Is there any scenario in which spark plugs need replacing after 13k miles? (e.g. the previous owner tracked it a lot).2) Did the spark plugs in the picture actually need replacing?3) Does the intake manifold needs to be removed to replace the plugs, justifying 3 - 4 hours service time? Some online videos suggests not, but I'd love to know for sure.\n\nYour grounding electrode is clearly worn on both pictured.Being in the bay area I'm sure if you ask around you can find some of the best european car mechanics in the country. Used BMW out of warranty is a huge liability.\n\nThanks j0oftheworld, good to know.You are right, there are many other BMW mechanics in the area. The dealership is literally on my way in to work (pandemic aside) so I'm hoping to use them.I don't mind paying a dealership premium and I know what I signed up for when I bought the out of warranty car. So it is not about the maintenance cost per se.I just need to know if I can trust them or not.\n\nEverything they told you is legit and labor time is always quoted as book time.

The guides I've seen on other N55 don't show this.You're right. Shouldn't need to be removed and I'm sure the tech that did the work didn't remove it. The SA might not actually have been familiar with the work process compared to the tech doing the work\n\nMaybe service assoc. confused from N55 to S55?\n\nThese motors each plugs and the stock M2 plugs (same as S55) from Bosch have bad durability. Looks like they did need to be replaced though.Be aware the the SAs usually go by what the CBS says and what service internal you are at. I just had an SA try and tell me I was due for my rear diff fluid at my 4th oil change and 34k. Turns out they had reset my CBS at the break in, which they weren't supposed to do, so it looked like it was at my 5th change at 50k miles. They also wanted something like $340 which is ridiculous.\n\nGet a BMWCCA membership.  It will save you a minimum of 10% at your dealership.  Spark plugs are a maintenance item not a warranty item if that matters.\n\nThanks so much for all the feedback everyone. Makes me feel better if the service was legit.Here is a video that makes me think removing the intake is not necessary:\n\nAs I understand it, if the engine is stock the plugs only need changing every other oil change. New TIS suggests that should be every 60k Kms - so a little under 40k miles.Edit: And - based on that video and NewTIS, there is no need to be removing the intake...\n\nAs far as independent BMW shops go, these guys are the best:https://goo.gl/maps/ypQJ9ezNqX86KvPF9\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2driver101Hey everyone, I'm trying to figure out if I got ripped off by my local service center.

The dealership were not keen to do anything (as BMW would make them pay the costs of replacement), and the best I got out of either was that in the event of a fault developing - provided I continued to get it maintained by the dealer network - \"Goodwill\" would apply.\n\nJust bumping this up - I'm coming up in June and only have 10k miles but I imagine I don't have that many excuses to request a warranty repair (in the US)Was thinking of using Bluetooth wonkiness to be that excuse to see if they would upgrade the iDrive OS (and then I would lose all coding which would be annoying but easy to fix)The M Performance Exhaust (port-installed) also is loose and rattles on cold startup - wonder if that's a good enough excuse and if I should ask them to check anything else (annoying that there is no permanent fix for this)\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bylax01Just bumping this up - I'm coming up in June and only have 10k miles but I imagine I don't have that many excuses to request a warranty repair (in the US)Was thinking of using Bluetooth wonkiness to be that excuse to see if they would upgrade the iDrive OS (and then I would lose all coding which would be annoying but easy to fix)The M Performance Exhaust (port-installed) also is loose and rattles on cold startup - wonder if that's a good enough excuse and if I should ask them to check anything else (annoying that there is no permanent fix for this)You don't necessarily need to have an issue to request them to once over the car.

The iron rotors are pretty tough, even when subjected to track duties.\n\nI opted to do the full maintenance concurrent with the 4/50 warranty. Essentially it's the \"old\" plan that came with every new car in NA, up through 2015 - literally everything is covered, all wear items, including brakes, wiper blades, etc. It's absolutely true that if you need a brake job before 50k, you've more than paid for the entire plan. If you don't - then perhaps not. The plan is fully transferable (important!), if the car gets totaled they pro-rate the unused portion back to you, and it even calls for a rental car to be provided during service, if the dealership can't cough up a loaner.Whatever you do, don't pay full price! These plans are heavily marked up. Work the F&I guy to get a deal. If he/she says \"that's the price\" then immediately decline. Then watch as 30 seconds later some discount that was impossible 30 seconds ago suddenly materializes.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydetroitm2You must be beating the hell out of your brakes if you are cracking them after 2 days.

Now, they want to price gouge for the same exact coverage and then some.The most I gotten out of the plan was a few brake changes, yearly wiper blades (only if you specifically asked) and once I was given a new battery.They only replaced worn parts on your vehicle if the computer specifically tell them it's due.  It's not like for that cost, you pick and choosewhatis required to be done on your vehicle orwhenit gets done..Other than that, I could of easily payed or replaced all the stuff myself, without the need for the maintenance plan.I also like the autonomy of being able to change stuff on my vehicle, whenever I choose and it'a dictated by some bean-counters' algorithm, which I'm forced to leave my car at a dealer..I say the most that plan is worth is a $1,000, for 4 years of coverage. 6k is highway robbery..That would be hard pass for me also.The most difficult item to replace, which would of been covered under the maintenance plan is the brake; rotors and pads.Just fine yourself a shop that can properly complete a brake job and it would render that plan unnecessary fluff.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPoochieHowever, word on the street is that lately, they've been giving consumers a hard time on covering any and all clutch related jobs, under the program.According to my finance dude, a clutch will be replaced \"no questions asked\" under this program.

Looks like I need to pass or hang tough.  Much appreciated.That's a highly unreasonable cost for what is actually included. The 4 year maintenance plan use to be inclusive, with all new BMWs. Now, they want to price gouge for the same exact coverage and then some.The most I gotten out of the plan was a few brake changes, yearly wiper blades (only if you specifically asked) and once I was given a new battery.They only replaced worn parts on your vehicle if the computer specifically tell them it's due.  It's not like for that cost, you pick and choosewhatis required to be done on your vehicle orwhenit gets done..Other than that, I could of easily payed or replaced all the stuff myself, without the need for the maintenance plan.I also like the autonomy of being able to change stuff on my vehicle, whenever I choose and it'a dictated by some bean-counters' algorithm, which I'm forced to leave my car at a dealer..I say the most that plan is worth is a $1,000, for 4 years of coverage. 6k is highway robbery..That would be hard pass for me also.The most difficult item to replace, which would of been covered under the maintenance plan is the brake; rotors and pads.Just fine yourself a shop that can properly complete a brake job and it would render that plan unnecessary fluff.basic maintenance isn't what I want a warranty for. I want it for if the infotainment system shits the bed, or something else where the parts alone exceed the cost of the warranty. though I did not pay 6k for mine.. I would have said no to that as well.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevinCQuote:Originally Posted byPoochieHowever, word on the street is that lately, they've been giving consumers a hard time on covering any and all clutch related jobs, under the program.According to my finance dude, a clutch will be replaced \"no questions asked\" under this program. If I should ever need one and get any sort of pushback, I'm gonna visit his office and stand on his desk until he calls whomever he needs to call to get it shoved through.Oh ok, so a finance guy, the one working on commission, told you that. I guess he has absolutely no incentive to lie then..In the Information Age, It's actually kind of cute that some folks are still so naive and trusting, actually believing there is a relationships behind the finance and service manage - which is non-existent.The finance guy sells inflated, overpriced warranties or other unnecessary programs, service determines a couple of years later what would be covered under the said plans - or what theychooseto even bother with, before they blame the worn clutch on that ambiguous \"abuse\" line or whatever nonsense they need to spew in order to weasel their way out of covering it under the program, then informing you that you have to pay out of pocket.By the time you need that guardian angel of a finance guy to advocate for your claim, he'll be working for Audi by then.Doesn't matter anyways because he wouldn't be the least bit helpful, as service claims underwriter has the last word and they also work on commission #ConflictOfInterestTrust me bro, I'm going on my 5th BMW and Mini; I heard the same exact party line before closing a deal, when they were trying to push some BS to me. It's smart; I'll give them that; a simple twist of the truth puts consumer minds as ease and obviously it works but it's complete nonsense.When claim time arrives, the finance guy will back the play of whatever false narrative the service department regurgitates - if he's even still there to pretend vouching for your claim.At that juncture, you'll already be balls-deep into a worthless contract, so what choice would you but to swallow it.Of course, you assume I have no idea what I'm talking about because the finance guy told you otherwise - he was even wearing a tie! Meanwhile, I'm just some screen name with words on the internet  - and I get the skeptism; just remember what I said here you have that rude awakening, screaming on a desk, right before they call the cops.\n\nJust to clarify a couple points:msdss- So you did something bespoke, which is effectively the same as the +4 (in the link) but adding an extra year and reducing the mileage?https://bmwusaservice.com/ultimatecareBased on the following thread, I thought I'd see about adding the UC+ for the 3 years on the assumption I'd go through the rotors by the end of that with a few track days and not planning on having the car beyond that:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...=ultimate+careI'm guessing UC Scheduled, from the first link is just the standard warranty extended two more years?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byatruong247the oem brakes are better as street brakes. if you don't track, it will do fine. 2 track days and those brakes will start to show stress cracks on the drilled holes.This is normal and actually expected.

    "title": "Extended warranty",
    "content": "Hey guys what are your thoughts and suggestions on extended warranty??\n\nI passed on it for my m2c after extensive reading in the f80 forums for s55 reliability. That being said I was unsure how long I would keep the car anyways but added Geico's breakdown insurance just in case\n\nReally depends what kind of a deal you can get on  it and how risk averse you are.I had a bad experience with a 2004 S4 a while back and and am pretty risk averse as a result.I got the 3 extra year (total 7 years) platinum warrenty for $4500 which normally goes for $6500 AFAIK.Might not pay for itself but it's really a gamble.  The M2 is regarded as being fairly reliable as far as BMWs go but but considering how much parts and labour on cars like these go for 1 or 2 medium repairs could easily make the warrenty worth it.That being said I've had a 2020 M2C for over two years and haven't had a single repair done.\n\nIts like insurance right? Sometimes you win, mostly you lose, but it gives you peace of mind.  The warranty company sells it and prices it based on a calculus that they will come out ahead in the end.  You could be the minority of people who have a bad car and get more out of it, or you could be the majority of people who will not get enough use out of it.  You decide what you are comfortable with.  I never buy any of that extended crap or wheel/tire insurance, etc.\n\nI opted for the upgrade to full maintenance for the 4/50k warranty period. The big selling point (and boy was it driven home - the F&I guy practically had me in a headlock) is brakes. If you need a brake job before that coverage expires, it more than pays for itself on the brake job alone. And if you can't hammer your brakes hard enough to need replacement by 50k miles, you're driving the wrong car.I would never, ever pay full price for any sort of extended warranty or maintenance. The markups are massive. I ask the guy what's MY price and he's not willing to discount it at all. So I say yeah, hard pass for me. 2 minutes later he's poking at his keyboard and says I'm coming up as eligible for 17% military discount (never been in the military nor any immediate family) and some Costco member discount, and voila, here's a new price. I have no idea if any of that even was true, or if he was just trying to justify dropping the price right after saying he wouldn't, but either way, I wound up biting. Now I essentially have the plan that everybody got up through 2015 - the 4/50 warranty is also full maintenance during that entire period, and that means all consumables including brakes, clutch (!), wiper blades, you name it. Also calls for BMW to provide a rental car when in for service IF there are no loaners available.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKevinCI opted for the upgrade to full maintenance for the 4/50k warranty period.

I would like to sign up now to lock in pricing.So, I got on the web and BMW says you can purchase \"BMW Scheduled Services\" for 5 years (which is an additional 2 years after the 3 included years standard) for $899.My services would be conducted annually as I don't put on enough mileage.QUESTION:  Has anyone purchased \"Scheduled Services\" and can you get a discount off the $899 MSRP?  Also, can I just purchase, in advance, the Oil Services for years 5-8 now for $199?\n\nThe rub is you need that additional scheduled services plan (or equivalent ucare+) to bridge the default 3/36 coverage and get you to 5/60:\"The BMW Ultimate Care Oil Services plan includes unlimited oil and oil filter changes for three years for $199.00 plus taxes and disposal fees where applicable. Unlimited oil services included are based upon the associated BMW vehicle Condition Based Service (CBS) system. Available for all BMW vehicles that have reached 60 months or 60,000 miles and have no current Ultimate Care+ coverage. Plan is available for purchase once BMW vehicle has reached 54 months and has current BMW Ultimate Care Scheduled or BMW Ultimate Care+2 coverage. All work is carried out by BMW Trained Technicians using Original BMW Parts, which come with a two-year unlimited mileage limited warranty. Warranty repairs do not constitute an extension of the original limited warranty period for the vehicle or a part thereof. \"And then as you point out, who knows what they'll actually be charging for it in a couple years or if it will still even exist, as they try and service option customers to death, with this that and the other.",

    "content": "Any info on when this switch will happen and will there be any difference in product or basically the same 0w-30 LL01-FE stuff just made by Castrol instead of Shell?\n\nWait what? Where did you get this information? Bmw originally was with castrol but switched to shell recently, I don't think they're going to switch back especially since shell's GTL base stock oils imo are so much better than castrol at the current moment, like HTHS is higher with shell and NOACK numbers are really low. Also the current shell made 0w30 tpt oil is very very stout and some good stuff, I see literally no reason for bmw to abandon shell now.\n\nLooks like it will remain Shell until at least 2022, but agree with F87sources comments about Shells GTL base stock oils.https://www.shell.com/business-custo...-supplier.html\n\nhttps://svmotori.com/blogs/news/cast...ovider-in-2021saw it here as well as a post on boboilguy\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bysharpmoneyhttps://svmotori.com/blogs/news/cast...ovider-in-2021saw it here as well as a post on boboilguyYeah I saw it here now:https://bobistheoilguy.com/forums/th...astrol.333410/Interesting, I will keep looking at this topic. It is going to be hard to find current to date LL01 spec oils because newtis is gone.\n\nOk I looked more on this and so far castrol's product line now offers a 5w40 euro variant that is bmw LL01 approved, no info on HTHS etc.I still think the new PPE 5w40 is better with a super low noack and a 3.8 HTHS, equal to this will be the motul excess gen 2 5w40. Then castrols offerings.If LL01 doesnt matter there are oils with even higher HTHS ratings.\n\ni ask because currrently using the \"shell bmw tpt\" FE stuff for warranty, so stock up a few extra liters of shell or wait for castrol because there will be no difference in end product? thanks.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bysharpmoneyi ask because currrently using the \"shell bmw tpt\" FE stuff for warranty, so stock up a few extra liters of shell or wait for castrol because there will be no difference in end product? thanks.Well there is many facets to your question let me break it down.1) Yes there will be changes to the end product when castrol takes over, the end product will be LL01 FE as it meets bmw's minimum requirements, but the end product will have a different formulation and thus TBN, HTHS, NOACK, KV100 etc will be different - whether these differences will be better or worse than what shell offers is yet to be determined. I think it will be hard to beat what shell offers because the GTL formulations that shell has results in really low NOACK ratings, and HTHS is solid with shell products as of late.2) If you are only using bmw TPT for warranty (because there are indeed cheaper and better oils out there such as pennzoil platinum euro 5w40) then there is no point of stocking TPT unless you really like it, or only want to use 30 weight LL01 FE oils in the future. Because when you inevitably go for a dealer performed oil change you will have no choice but to get the castrol stuff put in your car essentially defeating the whole stocking up on TPT oil.3) The only exception to 1&2 is if you track your car, because it is unknown if the castrol stuff will be as stout as the current shell made TPT oil. So if you want to always use the bmw oil (which I recommend incase of warranty claims) then yeah stock up on some TPT.Overall imo just use whatever bmw is using on your car while under warranty, then swap out to better oils when warranty is over.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceQuote:Originally Posted bysharpmoneyi ask because currrently using the \"shell bmw tpt\" FE stuff for warranty, so stock up a few extra liters of shell or wait for castrol because there will be no difference in end product? thanks.Well there is many facets to your question let me break it down.1) Yes there will be changes to the end product when castrol takes over, the end product will be LL01 FE as it meets bmw's minimum requirements, but the end product will have a different formulation and thus TBN, HTHS, NOACK, KV100 etc will be different - whether these differences will be better or worse than what shell offers is yet to be determined.

Their 0W40 and 0W30 are almost 50% PAO based on pour point.The problem with Pennzoil is a very low ZDDP level and for whatever reason bad flash point retention that is consistent in UOA. BMW required from SOPUS different products than what SOPUS offers on sale. Generally, TPT has much higher PAO content and lower GTL content.What will Castrol offer, who knows. BMW made LL specifications more stringent when it comes to oxidation in 2018. Owners of N55 and S55 should not worry about this as it is aimed to B generation of engines, but a lot of very good oils cannot get approved bcs. oxidation requirements (All 0W oils with HTHS above 3.5 etc).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byedycolCastrol relies on PAO for high-end products (not their 5W40 Edge in stores).

The problem is castrols 5w40 (the lesser one) is the common variant here and 0w40 is never around and if it is only available in a 1L bottle for not a really good price. Same goes for mobil 1 0w40 esp which also has a high pao content, never available in stores.But I generally want to keep that LL01 raring so yeah, pennzoil it is till the new castrol oils debut and then I'll see if it's worth making a switch.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceThanks for the info!That's why I also look for the MB approvals too.

But, besides that, why drop if no fuel? There is something with base stock stability that is an issue. I saw a similar drop in UOA on N52 that does not see track time. M2 should be much tougher, yet it seems flash point drop is consistent. That means that the Noack value later is much, much higher (the higher flash point is one of the indicators of low-Noack. For example, the previous version of Mobil1 ESP 5W30 had the flash point of 254c and Noack 5.6%). It is still track-capable oil as it is Porsche A40 oil, but IMO, for street/track in M2 I would always go Motul 5W40 Sport or 300V.",

While I was there, the SA suggested that I could have the 10k service done as well to \"get it out of the way\". I asked him if there would be any adverse effects doing it so early since the next service wouldn't be till a bit later. He said no.Since I am roughly around 5.5k miles on it, my question is, should I be concerned that he was suggesting this service being done so early or is he correct that it doesn't matter if I got the service now at 5.5k or at 10k.\n\nThe earlier the service is done, the earlier your service will come up, so your interval maintenance that YOU have to pay for will be sooner.But my dealer did something similar that worked in my favor.  My warranty is out in December, and with only 14K on the clock they agreed to do the plugs on the car, which I think is supposed to be at 20K, but with how little I drive the car I would have needed that service at the end of next year or later (and it would have been on my dime), so they did them early for me.\n\nIf your car notified you of the service get it done..Your service intervals are time AND/OR mileage based whichever comes first. Yearly or 10k. Regardless of which occurs you'll get the same number of maintenance items within your warranty.Skip it and you'll void your warranty for not having service done when your car called for it. Choice is yours.If your car hasn't reached either milestone then ignore the SA.\n\nThanks guys.

I was a little worried after seeing the recent YouTube post from Nfoxtv stating that it wasnt so much of a Change to convince himself but I have to say the experience is very different. Its much more raw and grunty than the 140. And the sense of stability when you start pushing is awesome!I had a few comments from the dealership which I thought Id share to get peoples thoughts on. Firstly I had the comments around the car having its power somewhat restricted prior to its break in service. Ive seen the threads on this before but I just wanted to confirm that it was info I was getting from the dealer when I picked the car up.Secondly they said not worry about revving past 4K during run in so long as it wasnt prolonged bouts. They were very emphatic about being prompt with the run in service so I didnt get the sense they were just more laid back about things... Im curious what the general consensus is on this point?\n\nNothing will happen if you rev it once or twice...\n\nI believe the manual says keep it below 5.5k rpm not 4, but check yourself.\n\nI doubt the power is restricted, I think the only thing restricted is launch control.\n\nCan't remember exactly where I copied the following; even though it is for Porsches (OK, there, I said a dirty word!), the basic advice seems sound and applicable to all high performance engines... which is to gradually increase RPMs over the break-in period.

How long varies but I vary a lot the first 100 or so miles and somewhat up to 500.  Supposedly a fixed RPM for a long time causes uneven ring break-in and higher oil usage over time.Plus it gives you an excuse to play a bit, ie drop a gear and accelerate every so often.  But just varying 3-5 mph over time makes a difference.PS:  One BMW that I picked up > 100 miles from home and may have used cruise on the first trip, did seem to be more loose (and flat) at a certain highway RPM.

    "title": "Hard Clicking When Pressing Clutch Pedal",
    "content": "Hey,Does anyone else get a hard clicking sound and feeling when pressing the clutch pedal?It seems to happen about 80% of the time when pressing it in. Gear changes while on the move. Going from N to 1st, etc.2018 OG M2.\n\nNearly 44k miles now on my 2017 OG 6MT and have never experienced any clicking from the clutch pedal. I would definitely have that checked out under warranty.\n\nIts the clutch and its pretty normal to hear at low speeds in a parking lot or pulling into a garage, etc.  Been like that since the day I took it home from delivery.\n\nnot normal at all\n\nmine doesn't click at all.  I'd get down in the footwell and actuate the pedal with your hand - see if you can get it to happen.  Maybe with your head down there you can get a better idea of what exactly is clicking.\n\nHave it back at the dealership for them to take a look at it along with a rattle sound in the dashboard that's been ongoing forever.I'll update when I hear the results.\n\nIt's your clutch pedal stop buffer.  Part# 35311103849. It's under a dollar for the part, you can reach behind your clutch and feel it out and swap it yourself, takes less than a minute. It's a plastic piece that creates a softer buffer in between your clutch and the contact point on the car which eliminates the clicking noise.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byhlm2cIt's your clutch pedal stop buffer.

Unless OP's pedal is clicking at the bottom of its travel, it's unlikely that the rubber bumper is the cause.\n\nOP are you sure it's not just chatter?  As I said before it's pretty normal on these cars as mine has been on the noisy side since the day I picked it up a year ago;https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1478107That said you shouldn't be feeling vibrations through the pedal so maybe there's something different going on with your car but if you aren't used to a noisy clutch this car takes a little getting used to.\n\nIs it right at the top of the travel (like less than a 1/4\" of travel)? I get it too. Almost like the pivot joint the clutch pedal attaches to is moving sideways or something.It never bothered me enough to check/fix, but its certainly there.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byheavyD^2OP are you sure it's not just chatter?

We'll see what BMW says.\n\nSame issue. Took it in but of course the tech couldn't replicate, even though before I gave them the car I demonstrated it.Going to take it back to another dealership. Not only is the noise driving me insane but you can feel like the click in the clutch pedal. It's almost like a spring is not seated properly but eventually conforms to the proper position once pressure is applied. Happens about 40% of the time for me.\n\nI have this perhaps even more than 40% of the time.My car is modified, and I worry about taking it in with drivetrain modifications because I don't want my car to be 'red-listed'. I usually remove all of my modifications before I take the car to a dealer, and for the sake of a $30 part, I cannot be bothered to do that.I'm seriously considering an Ultimate Clutch pedal though. ~$300 is a lot more than $30... Maybe I should wait until Black Friday and / or Labor Day and see if there's a sale!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byNezilI have this perhaps even more than 40% of the time.My car is modified, and I worry about taking it in with drivetrain modifications because I don't want my car to be 'red-listed'.

Maybe I should wait until Black Friday and / or Labor Day and see if there's a sale!Similar boat here. I ended up taking mine in and they are ordering a new spring. If they are successful, Ill let you know. I suspect if you wanted to replace the spring yourself it couldnt be that expensive. The ultimate clutch pedal does sound appealing. That was going to be my backup plan.\n\nHope it is successful, just got my car back and they replaced a bunch of parts. See my post herehttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...2&postcount=21When it clicks on the down stroke, it was simply annoying as hell.\n\nSadly, didn’t work. Noticed the click on the drive home after I picked up the car. We’ll give it another attempt in a month or so.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypz619Sadly, didnt work. Noticed the click on the drive home after I picked up the car. Well give it another attempt in a month or so.Sorry to hear that. It took me three separate visits before the foreman was able to replicate it himself, that was only after I realized my case happens more than 50% when shifting in a LEFT-hand turn.I was so discouraged and yet bothered by this \"click\", it is so much of a distraction and I am not overly OCD. At one point I was going to just have the independent shop install the UCP but I wasn't convinced it was the actual clutch pedal, it felt and sounded like a spring slipped ever so slightly from the proper anchor, and ONLY on the first 1/4-1/2\" of the down stroke.I think my suspicion is right as my dealer did not replace the pedal itself. It's been 2 days and the clutch pedal has been behaving normally.Good luck.\n\nJust an update but took the car back in. I noticed when it's hotter it's far more repeatable. They ordered a new clutch slave cylinder which will hopefully fix this issue. We'll know shortly!\n\nAlso noticing this issue. I don't necessarily hear the clicking, but can definitely feel it...\n\nHappy to report the latest fix worked. Looking at the Work Order looks like the clutch master cylinder (not the slave) was replaced. How that contributed to a clicking inside the cabin, no clue, but it worked.\n\n2018 M2 with 8k miles. I had the same issue where i hear a clicking noise and the clutch is a bit hard. Brought it in under warranty and they replaced the clutch master cylinder and also replaced and clutch pedal bushing. Everything all good now and smooth!",

My service notification came up for February. I was busy with work and did not get the car in then. I'm told by the dealer it's due for the \"large\" service. For 1k euro.My hesitance regarding it is that I maintain the car myself. I changed the oil about 3k KM ago. As far as I'm concerned the car needs nothing and I'm more or less paying the 1k so that the service history looks good. I'm not planning to sell the car, and since COVID hit I do not even drive it much. I might have put 5k km last year in total.I'm perfectly satisfied to pull codes and check needed changes, visually inspect the pads/rotors, change out brake fluid if need be. I'm very curious if others see value in taking the car in like this for what will essentially be a checkmark in the history and little else. The service agent told me last I was there that although my warranty period is over that me bringing the car in for service would help me with goodwill repairs in the future.. pretty much sounds like a hustle to me. The car has been perfect and I'm inclined to service it myself when needed and leave off taking it in just to get the checkmark.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by5.M0NSTERI just got my service done today by BMW of Germany. This 2 year or 30,000 km oil drain interval is great. Really goes to show how good engine oils are these days.That over 18.600 miles!",

If you're still under warranty might be worth having the dealer at least take a look so they can note the fault in system. That way if it fails out of warranty BMW would be more inclined to help.\n\nWere you parked on an incline/decline?\n\nIt happened again this morning. Same exact scenario. Parked on a level garage floor. Unfortunately my warranty just lapsed in January but that's ok, gotta pay to play.I did flash an updated map today.

Give me a break. Some of your other advice on the forum is pretty questionable as well.There’s enough room in our oiling system to handle an extra 1/2 quart without any issue unless you overfilled it to begin with.I just think it’s silly that for a motor that’s known to burn a little oil (especially when tuned!), that it’s telling you it’s close to minimum level and the responses here are why is my dumb car telling me this??This isn't an uncommon thing. Try adding a 1/2 quart to see if it goes away.\n\nHe said that he flash tuned his car. It is a known issue because they use a tune from an engine with a larger oil capacity.

Letting the battery drain like that will decrease the life of the battery.\n\nThis would be the first car that I would need to charge for not driving it for 10 days .Granted I never had a car that used up so much juice on accessories .Am I confused or do most other cars constantly charge the battery from the alternator the whole time the car is running ?I mean weather I used the gas peddle or not the car was on for over an hour .I'm going out again tomorrow , if I get the same warning after driving all day she's going in for a new battery or alternator check.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byROBM2COk I will pay attention to this ...so you technically will get a better charge letting it idle then on the gas driving ...interesting .Not idle.

The system will prioritise charging a low battery.

I read that the car doesn't charge unless the battery symbol at the end of the blue bar is lit and that the alternator is decoupled so the engine doesn't have to work as hard to run it during that same time saving fuel and increasing performance.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byfullstackThanks for the info.

I read that the car doesn't charge unless the battery symbol at the end of the blue bar is lit and that the alternator is decoupled so the engine doesn't have to work as hard to run it during that same time saving fuel and increasing performance.No that is incorrect. The blue bar shows a type of 'super charging mode' like a regen if you will, however the battery still charges during normal driving too (even when the blue bar isn't showing).But yes it also has an intelligent battery charging system which can cut charge rate under hard acceleration. As well as reducing ancillary drain when battery levels are low.\n\nThe alternator charges all the time as far as I'm aware the efficient dynamics is on top of that. If you put a volt meter on your front posts and check battery voltage it should be 12.4 to 12.6 on a good battery and starting it up should push that to 13.5 to 14.5 volts\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///MCollectionThe alternator charges all the time as far as I'm aware the efficient dynamics is on top of that.

A LifePo4 battery would be a different story, but we're talking about a lead acid battery.\n\nI'm not using my car at all almost all year this year. Only starting in December did I start seeing the battery discharge message. The only place the car goes is to the grocery store once every 10 days, and the grocery store is only 2km away.So now I've started to have some drives. About one hour of driving then go to the grocery store. Now I do not get the message any more.",

Unless you track the car I would stick to the 0w30 that the car was intended to have for warranty purposes - especially when the dealer is doing it and it is being recorded.Remember the BMW twin power turbo 0w30 oil is extremely stout, so no need to go to a thicker oil unless you really heavily track the car. That being said 0w30 is so stout it can even handle track use without issue.\n\nI asked for 0w-40 because I do indeed track my car, and I really have nothing to lose because BMW's 0w-40 is LL-01 and is suitable for the M2, despite it not explicitly listing it in the owner's manual:https://www.bmw.ca/en/topics/offers-...0-1000-ml.htmlQuote:Suitable for all BMW M models with petrol engine, except M5/M6/Z3 M/Z8 before model year 2011, M3 before model year 2014.

Clearly, that isn't the PN some of us here got, however.Yes I know 0w40 is approved, but I don't know how this will all work though since bmw discontinued 0w40 and it is not on the tis anymore.Technically aftermarket 5w40 like pennzoil platinum euro is approved, but if you use that between oil changes you're more likely to have to fight them when it comes to major warranty concerns.If you're not extremely modded bmw to 0w30 is extremely stout and capable for track use, just lower your oil change interval.",

I have a very tight window of time, and initially declined that at the dealership.I HAD thought the existing maintenance plan would transfer but sounds like not the case.As is:  warranty remains for roughly 2.5 years.maintenance plan:  noneThe LEAST of the maintenance plans is $2k, which sure, tacked onto my loan is a few extra dollars a month, but is it worth it?With so much of the maintenance being when it needs it, rather than time or miles based, I am having a hard time calculating the worth of it.Basic things.. plugs, oil, brakes pads, flush, blah blah blah I can do myself.As more experienced M2C owners, is it worth it for me to add at least the minimum maintenance package?Thanks.. need opinions ASAP please!!  I have roughly 24 hours to add this on or not.\n\ni think you've answered you own question...Maintenancewhy pay for something that you can DIY?- gives you additional content for your channel- more content could lead to monetizationExtended Warranty- Monetization from YT can help pay for this.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by2PUTTi think you've answered you own question...Maintenancewhy pay for something that you can DIY?- gives you additional content for your channel- more content could lead to monetizationExtended Warranty- Monetization from YT can help pay for this.I appreciate and get that.. some of this is just trying to fully understand the opportunity I have while I have it.Plus.. **laugh** I havent had a car under warranty in YEARS.. what a crazy thing!The warranty is good for another 2.5 years, and might leave that as is and then figuring out about the maintenance plan.  Feels like I can cover that myself really but hoping for more info.Like what have other owners run into.. anything I might not know.\n\ni think you can use the remaining factory warranty to determine if you will need an extended warranty. it could be from BMW or a third party. with new or up to 12 month old car, GEICO offers a mechanical breakdown coverage as part of their auto insurance.\n\nYou can add the BMW warranty anytime as long as the original warranty is still enforce.  I would wait and see if you have any problems.",

My understanding is that keeping a battery fully charged will extend the life of the battery as well.Not sure of the real difference between a tender and a maintainer, but mine puts a load on the battery at regular intervals, then charges it back up.  A bit like it's being used, instead of just keeping it charged.  It was important to me for it to do that because my battery is tiny, and needs that to happen or it'll die a quick death.\n\nBringing back a slightly old post back to life. I recently purchased a Ctek Mxs 5.0. It worked great after I figured out that the suspention bolts were not a good grounding source. The Ctek sat at the stage 1-Desulfation forever. Once I changed the ground to the bolt holding down the fender brace it moved quickly to stage 3 - Bulk. So if you don't get to stage 3 right away after connecting, it's most likely you have a bad ground. After that charging took about 10hrs.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bytenkiesBringing back a slightly old post back to life. I recently purchased a Ctek Mxs 5.0.

Fuel injectors may have been installed without a damping component which is used to reduce vibration. If a damping component is not present, vibration will increase at the connection between the fuel line and the fuel rail, which over time, can result in damage at the connection.RemedyBMW will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the fuel injectors and if a damping component is missing, the injectors and the fuel rail will be replaced, free of charge. The recall is expected to begin December 21, 2020.

Since my M3 was Euro delivery, the car called for it one year after I picked it up at the Welt, which was in 6/2016 (car was produced 4/2016).  Likewise, I ordered my M2C in spring 2019, it was produced in 4/2019, I picked it up late 6/2019, and the car called for the first oil change 6/2020.Obviously, there is no downside to having the service done now other than inconvenience.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDanGFirst regular service is one year from the manufacture date.

No reason not to get a free service this month.Getting another free oil change after doing 600 miles from the last oil change.I did that once; they neglected to reset the oil light, after the change.Instead of getting pissed by their incompetence, a month later, I made a second appointment, with another dealer and them change the oil again and actually reset the indictor. They gave brand new loaner car, for another two days, to go practice donuts in and a free car washAt the time, I really just wanted the service light reset and didn't know how but I milked the situation.What I learned is that the dealers doesn't exactly share service records with each other, they just robotically do whatever service is requested, on the vehicle's computer, without questioning it.\n\nSorry to resurrect and old thread, but Im sitting here at the dealer discussing with my service advisor. He is saying my car does not need an oil service as I had the break in service 3000 miles ago. I told him that it has been a year since the manufacture date, and he insists that the manufacture date is the same as my in service date. I bought the car in 5/2020, the car was manufactured in 12/2019. Anyone have any documentation from BMW that states that the oil service dates coincide w the manufacture date as opposed to the in service date?Btw, my dealer is indeed doing the oil change, but if possible I would like to provide something to them just to educate...they are a good dealer and the service advisor seems like a good guy.\n\nWhat did your idrive say?  The dealer is not suppose to reset the service intervals at the breakin service.  The M2C says at startup a date or mileage when the car is due for service.  It is the earlier of the two events.",

UK has much more short journeys, stop start traffic, cold damp salty weather etc and our interval is twice time and mileage of US one....!?! Go figure.If it was an \"engineer led interval\" it would be the same everywhere.It's marketing led as long as failures etc don't become a PR problem. If you're keeping then for sure halve your service interval at the very least.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bynzafiQuote:Originally Posted byboss2kIts just an oil change and generally its set to 1yr/10K miles whichever is earlier.

Is 3k better than 5k? - It could be. Will the extra $100 put a dent in my wallet? - No.5k is definitely not too long as backed from loads of data on BITOG and UOA over the years. 3k was the norm back with conventional oil. It is no longer the norm with synthetic oil.Sure its not too much money but it is unnecessary. If you're worried you can always get your own oil analyzed and you'll be able to find a happy interval for your car backed with data.\n\nMy recommendation is to get a blackstone oil analysis kit and send them a sample when you change at 3k or 5k.  If they keep coming back clean and no need to change then you'll be able to make an educated decision instead of one made out of abundance of caution.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byrobertmMy recommendation is to get a blackstone oil analysis kit and send them a sample when you change at 3k or 5k.  If they keep coming back clean and no need to change then you'll be able to make an educated decision instead of one made out of abundance of caution.Synthetic or conventional, the problem is that wear is wear. Period. Microscopic shavings accumulate over time and while oil type does play a role, physics are physics. With every mile, your oil is dirtier, not cleaner. There's no magic here. And it's not rocket science either. More miles = dirtier oil. End of story.The fact of the matter is that any oil will be more contaminated at 5k miles than it is at 3k miles. That's just common sense.Now, you can argue that it isn't much dirtier - at least not enough to warrant a more frequent change (based on data) - which I understand. But it's not physically possible for your oil to be cleaner at 5k miles than it is at 3k.Therefore, your engine *is* actually wearing more at 5k than at 3k. It can be a tiny difference, but it's there.\n\nNot to take away from the oil debate, but can someone tell me why my SA asked me to bring both keys to the service tomorrow?First time BMW service has requested both keys for any of my cars.",

I'm trying to work out if this will save me money I do minimal miles around 6k per year. I haven't had any services as yet. The costs i have worked out so far from BMWs site:RIS £300Brake fluid £62 shows due 8/23Vehicle check £80 due 08/24 or 37k milesOil service and filter £263 due 08/22 or 17k miles.For brake fluid I'm guessing will only need one of these in the 5 years.For oil service will need 2 based on time rather than mileage.The question is on the 2nd oil service/vehicle check do they also change the spark plugs as this takes it from a £263 service to a £965 service and then the pack will be worthwhile. They also have a spark plug service for £495 every second oil change not sure how this is different to the oil change plus spark plug service cost of £965Would normally call my dealer but the offer expires at midnight tonight.\n\nI'd say it's worth it! and also I'm jealous you have that offer, I don't have it and probably because my car is 2 years old now....Brake pad service is on year 3 for £99",

    "content": "I've seen a few threads on here about the Quickjack system and how everyone likes it.  However, I'm trying to see the reason for using it?  Obviously on most vehicles it would be good for rotating tires, but on an M2C there's no need for that.  For oil changes, I already have some nice race ramps for that.  If someone has or uses the Quickjack for their M2, what are you using it for on a regular basis (not just a one time need)?  Thanks!\n\nI use my QuickJack quite frequently and love it. Does it do anything that I can't do with a jack + axle stands? No, but it is faster and does provide a bit more lift than I could get with my axle stands.My M2 is my daily and I also use it at the track pretty frequently from April through October. I do 1 or 2 oil changes per year, several brake fluid changes, and for each track day it is a tire & brake pad change. I prefer having the car level for oil changes rather than using ramps. Lifting the entire car in 1 go, then using my impact gun I can do a full tire change in 10-15 minutes (for winter/summer change). When I do a brake pad + tire change for track days, it's 1 hour or so. Brake fluid changes usually add 30 - 45 minutes because of the way I use my power bleeder. I think lifting each corner individually would easily add 15 minutes to the process or more.I also use the QuickJack for performing winter/summer tire change overs for friends and family and it saves a bunch of time there too. The extra lift it provides makes it a bit easier doing coolant and power steering work. I suspect it'll make things a bit easier for replacing springs and dampers too.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byaeroglavaI've seen a few threads on here about the Quickjack system and how everyone likes it.

Thanks!Used mine for Charge Pipe install as well as Intercooler install. Have used it for oil changes, and switching out Oem to Track Pads. Will use it soon to install Autosolutions Short Shifter, which requires removal of Stiffening Brace and Drive Shaft and Exhaust. Worth it in my experiences. I feel much safer under car with this lift. and allows a good amount of room to work with. Would love to have a full lift in my garage, but there is no headroom for one.\n\nI just bought one. Final straw/motivation to pull the trigger was looking at the hourly cost of our local DIY shop to rent a list for a coilover install. A full day with the lift would have been roughly half the cost of the Quickjack, so I went for it instead.I’ve wanted one for a while, and didn’t really want to do the install on jack stands. I’ve never really been comfortable under a car with all four corners on jack stands. (I also installed toe links on the rear and torque arms on the front). The lift worked great and feels super solid.We have 5 cars in the household, and three of them (M2 included)see regular track time, the other two get winter tires, so I’m swapping wheels/tires, brake pads, changing oil, bleeding brakes, performing track inspections, etc, all the time.If I just had 1-2 cars, and only used it for oil changes and tire rotations/seasonal swaps, I never would’ve justified the cost, but when I’ll probably use it 30 or more times per year, it seems like a nice addition to the garage.\n\nLove my QuickJack.Purchased it when I decided to DIY upgrade the FMIC, turbo inlet pipe, diverter valve, and charge/boost pipes. Just that alone justifies the cost, or most of it.I'll be adding an exhaust and an SSK and getting my calipers powder coated soon, and the QuickJack will be very handy for these installs/upgrades...I painted a logo on my FMIC and have needed to repaint it once. Need to again, actually due to rocks hitting it on some hard Dragon runs out in NC. Much easier to do this having FMIC off the car while the car is on the lift.Then there's brake fluid and pad changes, all easier on the QJ.Oil changes are also easier / a lot more comfortable to do now, but those can be done without lifting the car at all. So, an added bonus at least.My thinking was also for the future, I plan to keep the M2, add another car, and do all the maintenance myself on the future car. Plus other future/present family cars.Most importantly, the added peace of mind that the car is stable and wont fall on me is priceless. Never felt comfortable being under a car on jack stands.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bybentom2I just bought one.

I dont feel like buying the 5000 now just for the extra 80 pounds on the fat ass M2C....I use them for oil changes , tire changes ...Coilovers swaps ...diff swaps .. brakes .If you go to the track a lot guys will want to use it makes tire swaps a breeze .\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDriver87Love mine for track days and detailing.nice setup... which quick jack model do have? TIA\n\nI've got one of the 7000s, don't remember if it's the SLX or EXT. We got it so it could work on all of our vehicles. This one just BARELY works for the M2. I have to push it back to like within an inch of the rear tire and have the rubber blocks against the edges.\n\nI use the 5000 SLX and it has no problems with the lift points on my 2017 M2. I also have the extension rails which are needed for working on an 2000 E34 528i and 2015 Subaru Impreza. The best thing really is to grab a tape measure and measure the gap between lift points on all the vehicles you plan to work on. I could just use the SLX without the frame extensions for the E34 and Subaru but the lift blocks were at extremes of the SLX frame and not entirely on the lift points of the vehicles so things were pretty precarious. I suspect if I did have an EXT model it probably would be fine for the E34, Subaru and M2 but it wouldn't fit between the wheels of some compact & subcompacts.\n\nFound this at Lowes....$1249.....Looks interesting, neighbor is thinking of ordering.https://www.lowes.com/pd/Dannmar-Equ...ift/1001224576\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKilled by DeathFound this at Lowes....$1249.....Looks interesting, neighbor is thinking of ordering.https://www.lowes.com/pd/Dannmar-Equ...ift/1001224576Im struggling with the use case for this.Having all 4 wheels off the ground easily had me sold on the Quickjack, and Ive enjoyed having it the last few months for brakes, wheels, suspension and fluid changes, but this thing...

I was just putting info out there. Honestly, I don't think I'd crawl under a car while it was up on this thing. Actually I know I wouldn't. I suppose the only advantage for the one at Lowes is that it is collapsible and can hang on a wall\n\nYeah, the idea of using that tilting lift without jack stands underneath would absolutely not happen. With the way the QuickJacks lock into place I am pretty comfortable in their safety, as long as the car is sitting safely balanced on the lift blocks then it is very stable.I do store my QuickJack frames stored on the wall in the garage, they don't take up much space although I will admit they are really bloody heavy to lift onto the brackets I use to store them. I use some 75-100 lbs rated brackets solidly mounted into a solid 2x4 anchored through drywall into the stud wall of the garage.I know that QuickJack have been able to arrange for a bunch of distribution in Canada now and the price has come down pretty well too. When I bought mine direct from QuickJack they were delivered by freight which was handy but it was quite pricey. Costco and Canadian Tire both seem to sell the QuickJacks from time-to-time with sales. Although I think they usually are more limited in the models they sell, I personally wanted the 12V version which is a bit rarer (and also was backordered when I bought and delayed delivery by 2-3 months).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byKilled by DeathI didn't know Quickjack was the same price.

I suppose the only advantage for the one at Lowes is that it is collapsible and can hang on a wallSounds like were on the same page.Quickjack has been on sale for $999-1099 off and on at Costco. A bit more elsewhere. Assembly is a good afternoon project while youre on lockdown. I havent figured out a long term storage solution yet, and as mentioned above, the ramps are heavy, but it seems Ill have some free time for projects in the next month or more while were locked down. So maybe thatll happen soon.\n\nInspired by an image I'd seen on the QuickJack website, I mounted the frames to my garage wall.I mounted the frames using 2 x 3 3/4\" and 2 x 5\" 3/8\" wedge anchors. These are designed to bolt something to a wall, but can be used to just mount a stud to the wall, which is what I did.I mounted the studs about 1.5 inches into the wall, leaving 3.5 inches sticking out for the longer bolt, and 2.25 inches sticking out for the shorter one. I also used two slim 3/8\" nuts and a washer on the end of each stud to stop the frames from potentially sliding off, and wrapped insulating tape around the threads to make a smooth surface for the frames to hang from.I'm pretty happy with the results:\n\nI tried lifting my wife's 2016 Honda Pilot with the 5000 SLX model that I have, hoping that having the car supported on half each rubber block would be OK... It wasn't. Thankfully the car was only an inch or so off the ground when I rocked it to see how stable it would be and the rubber blocks popped out, dropping the car to the ground.Bend-pak were kind enough to ship me some other lifting options to try, and along with the extensions, which I paid full price for, I now have a solution for lifting both cars.Having said that, I've not used the Quickjack on her car since, and use it on mine at least once a month!\n\nThat looks like a nice tidy way to mount the frames. Mine hang vertically with a pair of hooks rated to each hold 60lbs so I figured with two per frame that was enough and they've held for the last 2 years.I also bought the frame extensions, I needed them for working on my father's E39 and my brother & sister's Subarus. Unfortunately with my brother's Impreza I do need to use little drive on wooden ramps to be able to fit the frames + extensions under the jack points but the extensions are nice and solid. My sister's SUV isn't great on the QuickJack because I lose so much just getting to the jack points but for changing tires or brake work it works well enough.\n\nI run the quick jacks on most of my cars.  Was hoping to use on the SUVs, but even the XL models are too short to get to the lift points and german SUVs don't have exposed rails.  I use them for oil changes, exhaust mods, brakes, pulling trans...pretty much anything.  I like that they are portable as i can take them outside, lift the car, pull the wheels and pressure wash and clean the wheel wells and suspension.  If my garage situation was different, I would have gone with max jax or a traditional 2 post lift as you can get higher for certain jobs.",

If it's on the right, the right mirror dips.  If it's in the middle, neither dip.  But on the M2 it has to be in the driver's position, and the passenger side dips?

Seems weird for it to disappear when you wash the car though.....Did you take the wheels off and inspect the brake shields?Maybe effect of water and or soap temporarily changing/lubricating sound? Still the most likely culprit and easy to find out.\n\nI've had a similar noise to the video posted above where there's a noticeable ticking noise when turning the wheel but it only happened after driving on canyon roads for some reason. However I brought it to my local bmw dealership and they stated this is a known issue. They cleaned some surfaces between the face of the wheel hub and replaced some bolts. That seemed to do the trick since I haven't heard the same ticking noises ever since.\n\nI had a clicking noise less than a year in on my 2017 6MT.  Was similar sound to the video and only when turning.  Was rocks in the rotor shield in back.  At the time I was not aware of the SIB to replace the shield.When it happened again right before my warranty was going to expire, I brought it back in and asked them to replace the shield under the SIB since the same thing was happening.  They fixed the problem, but said it was the strut \"top hats.\"  They replaced them both, along with a mess of washers and bolts.  I don't trust them and the sound was pretty much exactly the same as it had been before, but the sound is gone and hasn't come back so I can't really argue with them.Happy to post the service order if you think it'll help.",

No panels, no shields, just right there smack dab in the middle.Couldn't believe how nicely available the drain plug is.Re: questions about extractor - yea without a dipstick guess that's not really an option!Exactly, the drain plug is really easy to find and the oil filter housing is right on top of the engine. I have done oil changes on a lot of different cars and this one has to be the easiest I've ever done.\n\nCouple of Tips (at least things I've always done and are considered good practices):1. put thin layer of oil (new), with your finger, on the larger, filter housing O-ring, after installing the ring and just prior to screwing it back in.  I don't think this is mandatory but it helps create a better seal.2. Pour a bit of new oil into the new filter while it's in the housing, just before installing.  Enough oil to soak the filter if possible. Also not mandatory but from my understanding, this helps minimize time internals are \"ran dry\" and \"primes\" the oil filter.  Yes, it's hard to do this without spilling a bit of oil, but-a rag.\n\nAs some people have mentioned, there isnt a dip stick tube to use as a way to access the lower section of the oil pan. So using an oil extraction device isnt an option.To the person asking how much oil is still left stuck in the oil pan after letting it drain, its less than a 1/4 - 1/3 of a qt.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byinfinitekidM2CAnyone have an \"expert\" opinion on magnetic oil drain plugs?

Do I need that, or do I just need the washer that comes with the oil filter?  Thanks!You don't need to use the new crush washer, but not sure why you wouldn't if it's included.  It takes some stress off the threads and will help prevent leaks.\n\nIt's best to always replace the crush washer.I typically buy extras and keep them in my toolbox.\n\nsince you'll be there already, replace the washer. just think of the consequence if the plug starts causing an oil leak...then you'll pretty much have to do it all over again. keep it simple and do it once.\n\nI think he means there are 2 washers in the box, not whether he should use the washing included with the new filter.  Sometimes they include two washers since some models use the same size filter but require different size washers.  So they include 2 to let you choose based on which one fits your car.\n\nTo clarify,  the oil change kits that different companies put together include a separate drain plug washer in addition to the oil filter.  Here's FCP Euro's kit as an example, which is calling it an \"Engine Oil Drain Plug Gasket.\"https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw...11427854445kt1My question is do I need this extra drain plug washer, or is the one that comes with the oil filter sufficient?\n\nTo follow up, the one that came with the filter matched the one that the dealer put on the car at the last oil change.

I also wondered about that because 1M came with 5w-30 and 5w-40 seems a little more appealing because the cold viscosity remains the same.

Or if the manufactures are sacrificing long term reliability for increased MPG ratings.I don't know enough to form a good opinion on this, but it's something that should be considered for anyone owning one of these long term off warranty.Is 0w really in our best interest?Its not the oils fault its Subaru's fault as the tolerances they used to develop or manufacturer those engines were out of spec (there is a class action lawsuit against Subaru right now for this issue).I have a friend that bought a brand new 2014 Subaru Forester. I'm the only one changing his oil and I have noticed the car burning excessive amounts of oil. His car only has 40k miles. At 4000-4500 the low oil light comes on every time now. Once the light comes on it takes 1 entire quart to fill it back up. He changes his oil every 3500 now. Last oil change I put in little bit thicker 5w30 oil to see if it burns less oil.I have a 2012 Honda CRV (purchased new). 50k miles on it so far, and it does not burn any oil. I'm the only one changing the oil as well so I check the oil level before draining, always at the full mark. This car requires 0w-20 oil like the Subaru does.Yes 0w is extremely thin but I have faith that manufactures can develop a good engine that uses this oil.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychmuraIts not the oils fault its Subaru's fault as the tolerances they used to develop or manufacturer those engines were out of spec (there is a class action lawsuit against Subaru right now for this issue).I have a friend that bought a brand new 2014 Subaru Forester.

He's got 140,000 on it though and has not been very pro-active in getting it resolved.  I had a 2011 with no issue and suggested he get an Outback this time.It just seems like a bad concept if they are trying to make engines that can use thinner oil in order to meet EPA requirements and this is the end result.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychmuraYes 0w is extremely thin but I have faith that manufactures can develop a good engine that uses this oil.I don't understand how there is still so much ignorance regarding oil in 2016, especially on a board devoted to an enthusiast model.The number before the W in an oil is the cold weight of the oil.  The second number is the weight at full temp.  (Cold Weight)W(Hot Weight)Both the 0W40 and 5W40 are 40 weight oils and will have the same thickness and film strength at full operating temp.  Where the 0W is SUPERIOR to the 5W is at cold start up.  The 0W is thinner only at start up so the motor turns over easier and the engine has proper lubrication the moment it cranks.  It is not a thinner oil overall and/or at operating temp, only at start up where you want the oil to be thin.Also, any 0W oil will always be a full synthetic.  There is no such thing as a 0W conventional.\n\nI have an 06 WRX with 120k. However the previous owner did oil changes every 3500 miles. The Boxer layout is susceptible to oil starvation which is why Porsche uses 7 qts an oil change. Since Subaru owners will not pay as much for an oil change, you have to change oil more frequently than a conventional car.Btw the oil I use is Belgian Castrol 0W30. It made the engine much smoother and I plan to use it in the M2.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byepinfrenI don't understand how there is still so much ignorance regarding oil in 2016, especially on a board devoted to an enthusiast model.The number before the W in an oil is the cold weight of the oil.

There is no such thing as a 0W conventional.OK let me start with this my fellow car loving brother.  As you can see by my length of time here, I have been on here a long time and I have never seen anyone change their opinions online.  It is a useless endeavour but some of us are gluttons for punishment.   I have two kids....despite being peed on, vomited at, sneezed at, being up all night for the 4 years straight I went ahead and had a second child.  So those are my credentials to address your statement.First let me start with this.  You are 1,000,000% correct with with your \"technical\" review of the facts and 99% here know that the lower viscosity number is cold weight, etc.  No one is disputing that or is ignorant unlike the Birthers that believe bashing a car with no miles is actually better for it.So we have that out of the way.  I am agreeing with you and the only reason I am putting such a long reply despite being in agreement with you on the technical accuracy you brought up is because I am the original poster.So again, I do not disagree with you but I also understand why many are skeptical and nervous about 0W oils.First Reason History.Dr told women Thalidomide was good for pregnant women.  Later it caused birth defects.Dr.s said Eggs and Butter bad and margarine good.  Peanut Butter and Avocados were high in fat and cholesterol.  Now, natural peanut butter is good as are eggs and real butter.Hang in there, I'll get to cars...BMW recommended periodic transmission, diff and fluid changes in their cars.  Then around 2003, the exact same car with no mechanical difference became lifetime fill fluids.   As soon as BMW started to pay for service, the coolant flushes, brake fluid intervals doubled.Those that are cynical believe it was because now that BMW was paying for the service, they simply decreed longer intervals.    So you can begin to see a pattern here I hope.  My 2011 BMW 1M motor is no different internally than most other N54 motors yet for my M version, they gave me a 1200 mile old school break-in that was not afforded to non M motors that were identical!So manufacturers do things for THEIR interests not  yours and many understand that which is why they are skeptical!   I have never left oil in my car for two years and 15K miles nor have I left the same transmission oil and diff oil for the 15 years.  Guess what, BMW has now backtracked from the lifetime fill because they experimented with a generation of cars and realized that transmissions were failing at 90K miles.So why are manufacturers going with 0W oils.  If you believe in the tooth fairy, you assume that it is because of less engine wear during cold starts.   I'm sure that is part of it, the non tooth-fairy crowd believe it has to do with meeting tough fuel consumption standards.  With a thin oil there is less parasitic drag especially when cold and you can start driving immediately.   Also, you can designate one oil that will work worldwide!  That is a very cool thing.  In the past, you were given oil options based on average temperatures.So the question then becomes, do you want to put the best possible oil for your temperature range or want a jack-of-all-trades oil designed to be OK in the Siberian winter?   If there is in fact no trade-off with the zero weight, then that would be fine.  But the non tooth-fairy believers think that there are always tradeoffs!  It's too good to be true and we wonder if BMW is again experimenting on our dime with our cars.There are engineers that believe that the thinner oil, even if it is only during the warm up stage is passing through valve guides, rings, etc causing consumption and worse yet blow-by that can create carbon build up on valves, especially in direct injected motors.Now if you live in a part of the country where it gets really cold in the winter, then a little extra consumption would be worth it so you don't have congealed oil even though 5W is already pretty good at preventing that.  But what about people like me that live in hot climates and get sunburned in the winter and store our cars in garages?  The tradeoff benefit of a 0W vs a 5W might not be worth it if there is a chance of extra consumption and blow-by.I have attached an image of a Consumer Reports article where they discuss this and I will include the link also.So to summarize.0W is being used to reduce fuel consumption and to have one oil that works worlwide.Some believe that there are trade-offs.  If you drive a lot and lived in cold climate then the benefits of 0W probably make sense.  The oil flows quickly and I save on gas.If you live in a hot climate and drive it very little then you might not want to make your dream car part of the 0W experiment because in a hot climate, there is less benefit to 0W.http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/n...-oil/index.htm\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byClothSeatsI have an 06 WRX with 120k.

I have simply followed the oil life monitor on my 06 330i and it runs great and consumes no oil at 212,000 miles.  The caveat is I drive 25,000 plus miles a year so oil gets changed every 6 months and I drive almost 100% highway miles.  I do change my transmission fluid and filter every 70,000 miles or so because I can't buy the idea of a lifetime fluid.  For what it's worth I believe that with the higher oil capacity and the use of a high quality synthetic we are fine going with the manufacturers recommendations, that is unless you have a reason not too like track days, your more comfortable doing shorter intervals etc.  No one but you will pay for the cost of the oil change or consequences from not changing it so I don't really understand the debates and the emotions that come with them.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypruettfanOil debates are always entertaining.

It is comforting that you have had luck with your 330i but if you read the concern that some have is with 0 weight oil.  Your point about trusting the manufacturer is also well taken but for some of us that are car geeks and eat, sleep and drink this stuff there are some pretty significant differences.  You car went 212k miles on I assume the recommended 5w-30 oil and is not a turbocharged or direct injection motor.   So your point is valid but there are some significant differences between an NA motor and the M2 / 1M direct injected turbo motors which is what we were discussing.\n\nOn my previous turbocharged engines i put 0W in during winter ( 0-10°C) and up to 15W for a old turbo engine during summer ( up to 50°C) and that worked for me, i had a peugeot 206 tubo diesel engine (hdi) used from new to 315K kms on the counter with a clean healthy engine with zero turbo issue and zero oil consumption.\n\nI am sold on the Pennzoil from nat-gas as a cleaner oil.  Very interesting that on the Pennzoil Web site they recommend Euro 5W-40 which does have a pour point of -42.  Where BMW does say that a 5-40 CAN BE USED -- THE MOST COMMON oil used at a dealership for the N55 is 0W-30...I am going with Pennzoil EURO 5W-40 LL-01 oil very 5k OCI.  Having been a prior owner of the N54 engine -- and reading the latest from Mike Miller who recommends 5k OCI for the N54/N55..I would think the M2 with an N55 variant would be best served with the EURO 5W-40 in warranty and possibly even Redline 5W-30 post warranty due to RL is a heavy 30wt almost near 40wt but as a full ester which handles the heat & really superior oil for the turbo.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by123BrittI am sold on the Pennzoil from nat-gas as a cleaner oil.

They figure for most people if you sacrifice a little less protection for the mileage it's worth it but those that want a little more protection especially in warm climates can go 40 weight.   After studying direct injection motors a little more I have decided to go with Pennzoil 5w-40 platinum euro in my 1M.  DI motors inject fuel directly into the cylinder so some fuel is sprayed in the cylinder walls and makes it into the oil.  That's why they use synth ti and special additives to keep it from thinning.   40 gives a little extra protection in my opinion.  As to 0 weight I also worry about such thin oil even if only during low temps.  These motors leak all the time when they get older and I wonder if thinner oil will help makes leaks a little bigger as well as possible blow by and as consumer reports extra oil passing through valve guides and rings.  Not ready to gamble my pride and joy with Jack of all trades oil.\n\nSo my \"friend\" decided to go with 300v Trophy 0w40, the same Oil that is highly recommend for GTR, and any high performance sport carHe got X5 for which he get rid of bmw warranty from the first day as this oil is not LL approved and he wanted to keep the car for very time period, so he started to fill it from his first service, and after 150k miles not a single problem he had with it engine or turbo.It costs twice more than any regular oil, and it's recommended to be changed around 5-6k miles.I'm looking forward to see the difference and let you know.",

OBD2 pulled ambient temp sensor.https://www.autocodes.com/p10ea_bmw.htmlWent to the dealer; dealer said they found a tune and denied my warranty. Then they pulled a \"crankshaft sensor plausible; direction of rotation implausible.\" They want 2.5k to check \"crankshaft bolt-check valve timing\" to start. The tech said that a tune can make the crankshaft bolt loose.The car ran exactly same before and after the check engine light. I'm having the dealer put the original software back. My question is, should I go through with dealer recommendation on the crankshaft?Cheers,\n\nSo you bought it with the tune? Did you buy it from an individual or BMW dealer. If the latter, you have a good argument if you didn't tune it.I would personally get a second opinion or find a friend with a BMW capable scan tool or software. I use a $230 Foxwell and that gets me most BMW specific functions. Then confirm the codes.\n\nWhat direction did you take? What was the outcome?\n\n\"direction of rotation implausible\" is such a funny description to me. It's like your crankshaft did a rotation on the z axis.

They didnt specify and I didnt ask(forgot to) if it was The total for parts and labor. He said if the spark plugs didnt fix the lag issue, that they would move on to replacing the coils. My maintenance warranty ran out in April 2020 so Im SOL and would have to pay out of this out of pocket.Could it be that it does need spark plugs? Could it be that there is a leak on the CAI?

Dealerships aren't designed to be cost efficient. Go to a reputable independent shop that specializes in BMWs, or get yourself an OBD2 scanner. See if there are codes that can provide you with insight before you start throwing parts at the problem.\n\nI literally just came from the dealer, and here's what he told me.The spark plug change is at 35K, and costs $550 (with labor), but he did it for me now (at 15K) so it would be free (my plan is up in December).He mentioned nothing about spark plugs being NEEDED at 35K miles, just that it was preventative, most say 60K miles.I'd say your problem isn't plugs.But if it is, I'd say that you can probably get them changed by any decent mechanic for a hell of a lot less than $475 or $550.  The plugs themselves are what, $150?  $475 and $550 is highway robbery...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byVisualEchoI literally just came from the dealer, and here's what he told me.The spark plug change is at 35K, and costs $550 (with labor), but he did it for me now (at 15K) so it would be free (my plan is up in December).He mentioned nothing about spark plugs being NEEDED at 35K miles, just that it was preventative, most say 60K miles.I'd say your problem isn't plugs.But if it is, I'd say that you can probably get them changed by any decent mechanic for a hell of a lot less than $475 or $550.

I think the back one is a little difficult, but there is an access hatch and you can use a swivel socket to make it easier. It's one of the reasons I liked the M2.

This dealership is pretty small with about maybe 10 cars in stock and 3 loaners which is why they denied me one lol.This is exactly what I was thinking(dealer not being cost efficient). The service guy seemed real pushy on getting the spark plugs ordered already even though I was telling him I would let him know in about a week if I would be going through with it.Ill first try to check the connections on the CAI to make sure theyre fully sealed and test it from there and also run a diagnostic test. If the issue persists Ill take it to indie shop to See what they recommend and perhaps have them do the spark plugs, chargepipe Im getting in mail today and catless downpipe I got the other day.Thanks for the help guys.\n\nI saw a video earlier today on how to change them. It does look fairly easy with the exception on the one closest to the firewall.

That's the easiest thing to do\n\nTrue. But I think I may have found the problem possibly and hopefully. Driving back home from the dealership, I had it on sport+ and would occasionally floor it with no problem other than the lag I’ve already mentioned. Nothing new. That was about a 40 minute drive. I stopped at parents before heading home for about an hour. On my way home, which is about a 20 minute drive, again on sport+ I did a hard acceleration from 3rd to 4th gear(DCT) and heard a loud AF pop which scared the heck out of me because I thought the worst. I tried accelerating to see how the car would react and only the RPM’s would move quickly as if I had it on neutral. The MPH would slowly move, matched by my cars acceleration, a freakin Prius could’ve swooshed by me. I drove about 1 more minute to get to my house. The car sounds a lot louder than usual. Accelerates at speed of about 10% (Don’t quote, me just threw out a random number) of what it should. And check engine light is on. Based on what I just read on a couple of posts on the forum, it sounds like the chargepipe gave out.I just find it a bit weird that it happened on the first day ever that I take it into a dealership, when I’ve driven that car slow like a grandma and to its full potential with the only “performance” part being the CAI.Dealership did change out the fuel tank ventilator. I don’t know if this has anything to do with the incident that happened earlier.Quote:Originally Posted bynioh_lbbm2the \"diagnostic\" you need to do is go back to stock CAI and see if that changes things. That's the easiest thing to do\n\nIf you need good diagnostics get yourself an MHD enet adapter for $69 (yes it is expensive but here's why it is worth it) then you can do the following:1) Use it with any length ethernet cable you desire and that allows you to get an enet cable that works with ISTA (bmw's factory diagnostics software and much better than any garbage obd2 scanner), and you also can use it with esys for coding. Both of these softwares are free.2) You can use the MHD adapter with MHD's logging software aka the monitor module allowing you extremely fast data logging of critical parts of your car.3) The MHD adapter works with other apps like: XHP transmission flashing, thor (drive train flashing), bimmer code, bimmer link, MHD's tuning software.So essentially one adapter fitting all your needs instead of having to buy: an enet cable, blue tooth adapter for the apps, and a k+dcan cable for mhd flashing.\n\nThank you, Ill definitely consider thisQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceIf you need good diagnostics get yourself an MHD enet adapter for $69 (yes it is expensive but here's why it is worth it) then you can do the following:1) Use it with any length ethernet cable you desire and that allows you to get an enet cable that works with ISTA (bmw's factory diagnostics software and much better than any garbage obd2 scanner), and you also can use it with esys for coding.

Chatted with an M2 owner who is also a service advisor and he has the same issue. None of this stuff was captured in notes of course but it is interesting. He is suspicious of it being the exhaust. Given how aggressive MPE is, it could be that it's just vibrating at the headers. I'd buy that.",

    "title": "DIY Oil Change or Dealer? 2019 M2C in warranty, NO maintenance plan",
    "content": "I'm looking for some advice fellow Bimmer petrol heads!I bought my 2019 M2C pre-owned from a Porsche dealer a few months back, thus the maintenance is no longer included, but the warranty is still valid.My car has < 5,000 mi, and the CBS is telling me I need to change the oil this month (still has 8,000mi to go though, but the time lapsed).  I'm pretty sure that I won't void any warranty if I change it my own using BMW Longlife-01 FE approved oil (planning on using LiquiMoly SPECIAL TEC B FE SAE 5W-30) and keep all of the receipts and records.Given this low mileage, chances are that nothing really should be wrong w/ the car or need any other services besides filter and oil.  However, something tells me to take it to the BMW dealer to not only do the oil change, but do a complete system check as well?  I'm pretty sure that the Porsche dealer I bought it from did nothing to it (except maybe safety inspection), so unsure if there could be an underlying issue that it should be addressed ASAP that only the dealer can find.Having a record that BMW inspected and completed an oil change is certainly helpful from a traceability perspective, but I would like to learn to work on my car, and changing the oil couldn't be any simpler (just acquired QuickJack 5000SLX, so need to put it to good use).What would you guys recommend?Tack så mycket!P.S. as I'm DFW TX area, and if I end up not doing it myself, I plan on taking it to either BMW of Grapevine (heard great things about this dealer), or a very reputable BMW indy shop, Ultimate Bimmer Service in Carrolton, which probably will be more cost effective.\n\nGood one, responding to myself...Since I didn't have a pre-purchase inspection done before I bought it (I took a gamble given the low mileage), the wise choice might be for the dealer to inspect it now to ensure everything is 100% kosher.  Then I'll just do a mid-cycle oil service myself in about 5k miles.I might be the odd duck here, but I've noticed that most M2C owners on this forum bought theirs brand new, so the maintenance was already included.\n\nNot sure about others, but I rather have BMW do it just to avoid any future issues when it comes to warranty work related to the engine and BMW trying to say it was caused by non-BMW maintenance service.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMikeD9Not sure about others, but I rather have BMW do it just to avoid any future issues when it comes to warranty work related to the engine and BMW trying to say it was caused by non-BMW maintenance service.I believe that is a true statement.  For those BMW owners that still have their cars in warranty and with an active included maintenance programme, they simply have their trusty BMW dealers perform the free yearly service.  No sense in paying out of pocket if BMW will cover it.  However, for those who are more keen and practical about long term ownership goals, I do see a trend of mid-cycle oil service on their own dime (either DIY or an indy shop), and that's quite prevalent for the F80/F82 platforms...I was just curious to see:\"what do most 2nd hand owners do regarding simple maintenance like oil changes when such services are no longer covered, but warranty is still in effect (especially at the yearly scheduled service time)?\"Is the consensus on this forum that most take their cars to the dealer, use an indy shop, or DIY?I don't think DIY mid-cycle oil changes are an issue, especially since the CBS computer data does not require resetting, you use BMW Longlife-01 FE approved oil/the Mann oil filter + keep all the receipts.\n\nNote: This is not legal advice and I am not your lawyer.I do a decent amount of lemon law work in CA, it is a very good idea to have this kind of maintenance work done by an authorized dealer.Could you do it just fine yourself? Absolutely.Would doing it yourself save you some money up front? YupIs it worth potentially losing a lemon law fight down the line over? Nope.As annoying as the upfront cost might be, it is much safer to get engine related work done by an authorized dealer. Even if you do everything right, you're leaving an opening for a defense by BMWNA if something in your motor lets go etc.As far as the inspection goes, you don't necessarily need to go to a dealership for that. In fact, a dealership is less likely to do a thorough inspection that most other qualified shops. Dealership training is all about efficiency and cost savings, not about giving techs the best skillset possible. An experienced, independent BMW shop is where I would suggest going for the inspection.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCalAcacianNote: This is not legal advice and I am not your lawyer.I do a decent amount of lemon law work in CA, it is a very good idea to have this kind of maintenance work done by an authorized dealer.Could you do it just fine yourself?

That's what I brought mine in for recently. Problem is next year when I need to also add brake fluid change and diff fluid change. They want $340 to change the diff fluid which is actually easier than an oil change.\n\nThanks to all to responded...I appreciate your input.Ended up going to a dealer for oil service and air cabin filter.   They also did a 40pt inspection - and all seemed to pass.I was pleased to find out that, despite being a 2nd owner, the maintenance was still active...I thought that years back BMW NA killed the maintenance programme if you purchase your bimmer pre-owned.Guess I lucked out, no?Skål y'all!PS I will definitely do a DIY mid-cycle oil service w/ Liqui Molly Super Tec 0W-30",

Wet boiling point is key especially if use is in wet or high humidity conditions.  My understanding is that fluid absorbs a lot more moisture as it heat cycles in wet conditions as in racing (vs just sitting at constant temp open bottle on a shelf).  My application is rally - winter and summer - so I regard it as cheap insurance not expensive fluid.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPolo08816+1.  I change it once per season.  SRF saves time and time is money.Agree.  SRF is cheaper for this reason.  Been changing/flushing only once per season for many years.\n\n+1 on RBF600, use that on my race motorcycle. RBF660 offers a little better feel but seems to soak up moisture faster and require more frequent flushing.This is on a motorcycle however, so brake feel is huge and what seems like small changes are more noticeable.\n\nAnybody have any problems on the stock fluid for one day?

If you are a beginner learning to do threshold braking then you'd be fine; however, brake fluids are cheap, and gives you a lot of confidence turn after turn. On the plus, it great for canyon driving as well!I don't know what's the standard brake fluid in our cars.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bylax01Anybody have any problems on the stock fluid for one day?

Same brakes.As for which fluid, Motul RBF660 is great if you are only going to track. Updated performance slightly over the RBF600, but if you are regularly driving on the street, the 660 will pick up more moisture and require more frequent changes. RBF600 is a better dual-purpose fluid.

No issues at all on track.Flushing the brakes on the M2 is the same as any 2/3/M car with brembo calipers. Guides for those cars will also work for you. I use a Schwaben bleeder to pressurize the master cylinder reservoir to push the fluid out. 1L is more than enough for the entire system.Quote:Originally Posted byTampaF87I hear great things about on-track performance of the Castrol SRF, but I haven't heard much about how it is to drive on the street.SRF works just fine on the street.

    "content": "Hello Fellows BMW owners.Do you know if there is any action class lawsuit against BMW related to the charge pipe issue?It has been proven that it will withstand stock boost pressures initially. But after age and repetitive heat cycles, the plastic becomes brittle and is prone to failure right where it connects to the throttle body.I had to replace at approximately 17,000 miles, due to failure right where it connects to the throttle body.Do you know how many people have gone through this! Just praying for an Action class lawsuit against BMW.\n\nAnd then what? a few years down the road you get a check for 50 cents in the mail and the lawyers pocket the rest?Just spend 200-300 now and get an aftermarket charge pipe chalk it up as preventative maintenance. They're so cheap it's not even worth the hassle\n\nUnfortunately, that was not the case with one of my buddies. When the charge pipe exploded the car suctioned a piece of debris and injure one cylinder. For the people that are not in to car’s this is something that they don’t look at all.My issue is that my car was only 17K miles when it happened. If I change my charge pipe they will void my warranty.Quote:Originally Posted bynioh_lbbm2And then what? a few years down the road you get a check for 50 cents in the mail and the lawyers pocket the rest?Just spend 200-300 now and get an aftermarket charge pipe chalk it up as preventative maintenance.

I understand your friend's situation, but if they replace yours with a new one, it would hopefully last until you are out of warranty and then you can go aftermarket.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJeffM2PRDallasUnfortunately, that was not the case with one of my buddies.

If I change my charge pipe they will void my warranty.If you're under warranty then you shouldn't have to worry about the charge pipe at all, if it blows and takes your motor with it then they'll replace everything for you.My opinion is just wait out the factory warranty till like the last month and then swap out to an aftermarket charge pipe.Like others have said a class action law suit would probably net you zero money since it has happened to so many people.\n\nI don't understand how an improvement like an after-market charge pipe voids the warranty?!?!  Do we know that for sure?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFalconUSAFI don't understand how an improvement like an after-market charge pipe voids the warranty?!?!  Do we know that for sure?Well that is a big grey area. In the USA you guys have the magneson moss law that in essence says you cannot lose warranty due to a mod unless proven the mod caused the failure.So if you get an engine failure maybe the dealer can pin it on your charge pipe leaking boost, interfering with the sensor idk. Like I said this is a big grey area subjected to alot of interpretation and arguing.\n\nGood info -- thx!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFalconUSAFGood info -- thx!np.\n\nAdamantly against any sort of class action.

Why would you be adamantly against it, if it forces the company to uograde their charge pipes on future builds thats a good thing no?\n\nGiven that its likely the majority of the N55 chargepipe failures occurred on either modified cars or track-driven cars, I doubt there is a large enough base to even consider a class action suit. And I'm sure the BMW lawyers will bring up this fact in court. If they can prove the majority of the plaintiffs were using the vehicles in extreme conditions (track), or have modifications, the class action lawyer will have no chance of winning. Theres just no money in it for anyone involved.So you have a couple options here. Ride it on the stock chargepipe until it fails, and replace it under warranty. Or replace it now for a couple hundred bucks and call it a day.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byGoneIn4SecsDo you own bmw stock?  Why would you be adamantly against it, if it forces the company to uograde their charge pipes on future builds thats a good thing no?No, I dont own BMW stock.Frankly I think its ineffective. If anything, warranty claims will be what sways an upgrade. If the warranty claim costs outweigh a part upgrade, then theyll likely upgrade a part. If it doesnt, it indicates there isnt enough support to start a class action anyways. If I had a problem with a charge pipe that keeps blowing off, I would honestly probably go small claims first. Far more likely to win a judgment that isnt a complete waste of time. Most class action lawsuits really just results in a win for the lawyers. If this was something more safety oriented that results in injuries or perhaps an issue where BMW was committing fraud I would be more accepting of a class action.Also Im not very familiar with the B58 motor, but it might have been already addressed.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypz619No, I don’t own BMW stock.Frankly I think it’s ineffective.

Also remember although they are lucrative for attorneys, in federal court (where this would end up), the attorneys are essentially capped at 25% of the settlement (court needs to approve it).  The rest goes to the class members.  Also if you dont like your share, you can always \"opt out\" and do a small claims court.

As long as BMW pays for it under warranty, and it failing doesn't result in injury, there is no basis for a class action suit.It shouldn't cause injury since the car doesn't complete die when it breaks it should enter limp mode to enable safe exit off of a road. And unless you drive your car with your head next to the charge pipe the act if it break shouldn't injury anyone directly.Financial loss out of warranty wouldn't count since stuff breaks out of warranty all the time. If that was the case everyone with an old car can sue because it broke down...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceI don't think a small court claim would go well against a corporate giant like bmw who probably have a crazy team of lawyers.IDK imo I really don't think a class action law suit for broken charge pipes will go well, it could be pinned on so many other things.

Best case they recall the charge pipe if a known issue comes up.\n\nFirst of all, dude the pipes must be included in the warranty. Second of all, in case you get to use any kind of boost, any kind of tune ups, the warranty runs out. In stock they run for at least 100k km. Which is not bad at all actually. And even if you decide that it is a problem from the factory, you must turn to a certain ''great'' court, not to the local judge, you know that? However i do not consider this a great reason to get to the court. As an example, i can tell you a case of a friend of mine. He filled a suit oflibel California, against a BMW dealership manager. It was at the local court, the guy lost it and had to pay the manager a pretty insame sum of money. You just don't go against these kind of companies.\n\nNoting how the intake pipes on previous naturally aspirated M3 used to dry rot, 100km is pretty impressive.I'm guessing Labour is the main cost in swapping them as it looks a bit fiddly.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypz619No, I dont own BMW stock.Frankly I think its ineffective.

It's because of the number of lawsuits BMW had to pay out for part failures.Same goes for the N54 fuel injectors (10 year / 120,000 miles), the N54 HPFP (10 year / 120,000 miles), and the N54 wastegates (8 years / 82,000 miles).We want this problem solved, it is going to take lawsuits.",

The carfax doesn't list a break in service that is usually done around ~3000 miles.From my understanding this break in service is important because the oil is filled with excessive metal particles from the new engine breaking in.Is this something I should be concerned about?The past owners were apparently an elderly couple, guess they don't know much about cars.Obviously as soon as I get the car I'm taking to the dealer to get it serviced.\n\nThe dealership should be able to tell if the car had the 1200 mile service done based on the chassis number if you have it. The service also includes a change of the fluid in the differential.I would expect the car to be demanding service if it hasn't had one by now, as the one after the 1200 mile service is at 2 years from manufacture.HTH\n\nIf I were you I'd pay for a BMW pre-purchase inspection (PPI) and ask if they can also look into the service (sounds like this was already done) and warranty history. Is the seller the same as the dealer you'd bring it to? If so, ask them to cover this and/or the actual service. If not I'd still ask if they would cover it or take it off the sales price if you pay for and purchase it.

Also looks like an M Performance sticker on the side skirt (although tough to tell from the pic).\n\nA couple other ways you can tell if break-in services was done sans maintenance records...1) If iDrive tells you it needs the break-in service done. Though maybe this was cleared when only an oil change was done.2) Launch control will be activated... Drive the car for 6 miles and get it up to temp. Then hold down the traction control button until DSC Off mode is enabled. Then hold the brake down, then press the gas pedal to the floor. If launch control is active, you will see so on the instrument cluster and the car will hold revs at 3500rpm. If you need further help understanding launch control, look at page 98 in the manual.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjkoralI think that's a common line.

If they can get permission, you may be able to contact the previous owner. I've been lucky enough to do that in the past. The previous owner can be totally upfront with you since they no longer own the vehicle.",

If you can prove its a manufacturing defect then by all means go at BMW.  I think its too late for that as any evidence is destroyed (im thinking the disk was not properly hardened). Only the first couple mm of the disk are hardened thats why they are toast after the min. thickness.If your disk is under the minimum wear you should replace it ASAP as you are now wearing the \"soft\" metal. This will reduce braking performance and cause all the issues you are mentioning.Also the brake pads start with about 17.9mm of material and are done when they have 3.7mm of material left. If yours are at 6mm then they are almost toast and not at 50%.Source:https://www.newtis.info/tisv2/a/en/f...ation/GsDShuvISource:https://www.bremboparts.com/europe/n...m2/000117272-1TBH it sounds like your still kinda young and dumb, you have to remember that this is a fast heavy car, and that will chew up brakes.I will say this feels like very fast wear (im at the start of my 3rd set of track pads with no lip on my discs), but maybe you live in a very hilly area where you use the brakes a lot? or do a lot of hard stops with cold brakes? and did you buy the car new? Previous owner may have ducked it up.Another interesting tidbit from BMWs service manualsRetaining pins and expanding spring: for vehicles older than 48 months it is recommended to replace the retaining spring!The spring loosing tension could lead to more noise.Source:https://www.newtis.info/tisv2/a/en/f...kes/1VnXy4bj7KGood luck, but it seems your in for new discs and pads. I recommend looking at upgraded discs as they might last longer.\n\nYeah, sorry if I sound ignorant, I just had different expectations coming from a non-M that I was more abusive with regarding the brakes. On top of that, having the service advisor telling me he had never seen such a thing along with a similar sentiment from a trusted mechanic led me to believe the worst.I do live/work in a hilly area, but the hilly parts of town I drive in are slower (no more than 30mph), and again I had different expectations coming from my 135i which I drove in the same areas. I do not do hard stops with cold brakes and I bought the car new.I really appreciate the detailed info regarding pad specs and the retaining pins/springs. I will be getting the brakes replaced one way or another, so I'll take a look at those as well.Could be a good excuse for a brake upgrade...\n\nOne of the ways BMW gets such good braking out of this car (initially) is with aggressive pads that literally eat rotors.  It's why you don't have to use much effort to get the car to stop very short.  If you're not tracking the car your very first mod should be the Akebono pads IMO.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byflyboy385Yeah, sorry if I sound ignorant, I just had different expectations coming from a non-M that I was more abusive with regarding the brakes.

I meant it toungue in cheek without meaning to offend.Asking questions and trying to develop your knowledge is the smartest and most mature thing I know.Its honestly a bit puzzeling how you wore the disc/pads so fast. Maybe its the stock pads because as I said I have used 2 sets of trackpads in about 12k miles and my discs are good on thickness (not on hairline cracks and heat abuse though).Are you bumping into the TC a lot? thats also not good for pad/disc longevity.\n\nWhy aren't you thrashing it on the street?

    "title": "BMS spark plug gap tool",
    "content": "Ok guys I would like to review the BMS 12 mm spark plug gap tool for bmw's, and I would also like to extend a big thank you to BMS for the absolutely stellar customer service and deal on this tool.Now lets begin, why would you want a tool like this? Well if you guys are tuned and are buying non-factory plugs (like the ever so popular NGK 97506 2 step colder plugs) that are not pre-gapped it is important to set the gap to either factory specs, or whatever your car requires as determined byReading the plug, and looking at your cars conditions - not just following the norms set by the internet as you want the largest gap possible to enhance combustion of the air fuel mixture in the cylinder. To set this gap you do not want to be tapping the plug against a hard surface because that could cause damage to the plug itself, instead you'd want a precision instrument to slowly and gently set the gap to ensure you do not damage the plug itself or close the gap too far which could damage the delicate iridium tip.Now with that aside what kind of tools are there, well there are 2 options:1) Spending a little bit of money (only $35 so that's pretty much nothing) for a BMS spark plug gap tool:https://burgertuning.com/collections...g_gapping_tooland doing this properly the first time.2) Cheaping out like I did and buying an absolute POS from China, aka typical aliexpress garbage. Now this is not to trash on made in China, because alot of good quality things like iPhones are made in China. But the difference is that things like iPhones have insanely good quality control, whereas aliexpress items do not which is a huge reason why you should avoid wasting your money initially on aliexpress. Also aliexpress reviews may not be a good indicator of quality, because often times sellers may tell a buyer to give them a 5 star review despite poor quality before giving a refund so this really skews off the review system. Trust me I have been using aliexpress for a long time (I've been a diamond member since 2016, I buy alot of little things like microfiber towels, tools, and wax sponges), and I am finally fed up with them after 65% of my purchases this year had either absolute garbage quality despite good reviews and high number of order, or the item not showing up. Also there is no customer service purchasing from aliexpress, the seller will often ignore you (the seller of this cheap tool ignored me) forcing you to open disputes through aliexpress which will overtime get your account closed if you keep doing it.Ok with that mini rant aside lets get onto images and different aspects of the items themselves:1) Build quality:Here are some images of the top and side of the BMS spark plug gap tool compared to the cheap aliexpress tool.Immediately right off the bat you can see a noticeable difference in quality. The BMS tool is made of billet aluminium and anodized black and everything feels SOLID. The aliexpress tool is made of aluminium as well but is coated heavily with black powder coating - including the threads which makes turning the knob more difficult - more on this later. Also the BMS tool is slightly larger which makes turning the knob easier.2) The knob and screw that will close the spark plug gapa) BMS:As you can see with the BMS tool has a large easy to hold knob with large grooves around the circumference making it easy to hold and turn. Combined with the anodized threads it makes it really smooth and easy to screw down with small turns - which is vital to not over tightening your gap.The next extremely important aspect is the screw itself, it is a dog point screw with a flat point. This means the thread itself ends a couple of mm before the point of the screw which is also flat and smooth. This is incredibly important as it contacts the electrode ground on the spark plug itself you do not want it to damage that part. As you can see in the last image the spark plug looks unscathed after use with the bms tool. This is a used spark plug too with some combustion residue left on the electrode ground itself. This residue is extremely soft and easy to scrape off, and you can see the BMS tool didn't even make a mark which is incredible.b) Aliexpress:Immediately you can see that the screw portion of the aliexpress tool is just a standard screw where the threads go all the way to the end. Even worse the screw is jagged at the tip and not even flat, this means when you turn the screw it will actually dig into the spark plug electrode ground itself causing damage. You can see the damage in the last image showing yet again another used spark plug with combustion deposits on the electrode ground. But this time you can see the aliexpress tool with its rough screw not only scraped off all of the soft deposits, but actually cut into the ground itself make a deep gouge, this is not ideal and reduces the amount of metal on the ground itself which imo is not a good thing for conduction. Also with the tiny knob it was quite difficult turning the knob slowly and precisely especially since the thick powder coating provided ALOT of resistance.3) Gap tool with plug insertedThis just shows the two gap tools with the plug inserted, yes the gap on both of them is set all the way so the ground touches the electrode. I only did this to see experiment how easy and how many turns it took, but it is irrelevant to the comparison with the exception that it is easier to over tighten the gap with the aliexpress tool because you have to use so much more force that you can accidentally slip.4) Spark plug threaded end:a) BMS:Here we see the bms tool's threaded end for the spark plug after gapping a used plug. You can see some slight residue leftover from the plug, but that was easily washed away. The important  thing is that the thread and the anodization remains in tact.b) aliexpress:With the aliexpress tool you can see how thick the powder coating is on the threads. This causes the threads to have a huge amount of resistance on the spark plug threads it actually causes a scrapping effect pulling alot of the residue off of the plug. But the worse part is that the powder coating came off as well and got stuck to the plug (I did not take a photo because it was really hard to see because the plug is so dirty). This is a bad thing as you do not want powder coating on your threads as it will get stuck in the threads of the cylinder head making it hard to remove the next time around, especially since you are not supposed to use antisieze on the plug and are supposed to rely on the plating of the plug for antisiezing properties which will of course be affected if powder coating is stuck on it.5) Shipping/customer service:a) BMS:Shipping: It took 5 days via fedex with the intercooler (spoiler to what I am reviewing next) I purchased.Customer service: Absolutely top notch and imo is the best I have ever experienced. An example is back in 2014 when I first got started in the turbo bmw platform with my m235i, Terry from BMS would reply to my emails within minutes (he still replies to my emails within minutes, albeit since I do not have a jb4 anymore on my m2 I do not contact him much anymore) even on weekends to answer my questions. Over the period of time with my jb4 m235i he answered like a couple hundred emails without complaint or hesitation and with insanely fast response times, this shows absolutely excellent customer support.b) Aliexpress:Shipping: 100+ days with a few extensions of receiving time.Customer service: nonexistent and don't expect aliexpress to take your side either, I have lost dispute cases on a $500 front lip that came cracked because they wanted me to ship it back which would have costed a couple hundred $ CAD since it was so big. So the best I got was a 50% refund.Overall what you can see is the BMS tool is superior to the cheap aliexpress tool in every single way, from having a large and easy to manipulate knob, a screw design that does not cause damage to the plug, and an anodized coating providing a smooth near frictionless surface that allows for easy turning of the knob and does not leave residue on the plug. So it is clear you should not waste your money on cheap aliexpress garbage as you will likely have to buy a new one when you discover the inevitable short comings, or end up damaging your plugs.Also I have to note the anodized versions of the aliexpress ones are pretty crappy as well. The reason why is because the anodization is so thin on those tools it flakes off onto the plug and you have the same issue again. I have also experienced that issue leading me to get a powder coated version which was worse. Also the screw is still defective on the anodized aliexpress version. So again imo just don't waste your time and money trying to cheap out, spend a few extra dollars and get the proper tool.Ok guys I would like to review the BMS 12 mm spark plug gap tool for bmw's, and I would also like to extend a big thank you to BMS for the absolutely stellar customer service and deal on this tool.\n\nNice write-up!What gap would you recommend with the 97506's if running an E47 tune that hits 19-21psi thru a Stage 1 turbo and making ~425whp?Currently, I'm at 0.020\" and get little hiccups at lower RPMs when doing WOT single gear log pulls or dyno runs.

No knock events, just little hiccups.Thanks.Thanks for the kind words!Stock gap, I would have also stayed on the stock heat range plugs too but the more accurate advice would be to read your plugs. Here's my logic, m3's and m4s run even more boost and make more power when tuned and have no problems on the stock gap or stock plugs. There should be no reason to gap down so much unless you are experiencing misfires at the stock gap, and there should be no reason to go with colder plugs unless your plugs are reading hot. It's common for tuners to instantly recommend colder plugs and super small gaps immediately when there is no need, and the only result you will get is poor combustion and harsh idles. So I believe in your case the hiccups you see is due to the gap being too small.Here is a great quote from Justin at twisted tuning explaining all of this, and keep in mind he has an 800 who supra on stock plugs with stock gap and no issues. Another reason why most of the advice on spark plug gap is really bad, and the only way to truly know what gap and plug to run is to read your plugs and data log.Quote:Just recommending someone go to a one or two step colder plug because of a changed tune is not best practice. Poor combustion and misfires can occur.The stock heat range in the N55 is fine to 700whp or so. One step colder than N54 stock. And the same heat range as nissan GTR stock plugs. GTRs run the stock heat range to 800whp or so.The old recommendation of one step colder per 100whp is also not accurate. I mention this because ive seen it spewed on a lot of these groups. By that recommendation people would be looking for 6 step colder plugs in some cars.Also, which is a slightly different topic (has nothing to do with your post) but people need to stop immediately recommending .018 plug gaps just because a car is tuned.Ideally you want the largest gap possible for a setup that promotes complete combustion without blowout (failure of the spark to jump the gap).Long story short.... proper spark plug recommendation should come from reading the plugs for a specific setup. Not a blanket recommendation from something you’ve seen people do.IE- my A90 supra for instance. I’ve seen some tuners already recommended colder plugs or gapped down plugs for immediate process after tuning. Well, my car... stock plugs, stock gap. At over 700whp and 720wtq and reading the plugs show no issues. And the car has not skipped a beat or misfired at all.\"\n\nSo, we have one tuner vs all the other tuners out there that recommend colder plugs and tighter gap.I’m happy to try stock, but I have no idea what to believe!Until I find what works, that is.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZM2So, we have one tuner vs all the other tuners out there that recommend colder plugs and tighter gap.I’m happy to try stock, but I have no idea what to believe!Until I find what works, that is.Not really, from what I see we have a bunch of bmw tuners who follow the trend of gapping down plugs based on a generic one size fits all recommendation vs. a tuner who recommends seeing what each individual car needs aka reading the plugs and data logs to look for misfires. We also see data from plug types and heat ranges being used on other platforms pushing more power than any bmw can without issue. So if you were asking me I would go with examining each and every individual application vs. following the sheep and gapping down for no reason. Plus you don't see the m4 gts with water injection pushing more power than most tuned n55's require colder plugs or smaller gaps. Plus imo Justin is the best tuner out there, I've seen alot of big name flash tuners who can't deliver and yet everyone raves about that individual (you know who I'm talking about) and then the crowd just follows without asking questions, and other tuners have shady histories of blowing motors. Justin has none of those issues.But anyways like you said, just experiment around on your car and see what makes your engine happy that's the best way to do it. Make sure you google reading plugs and see the signs of spark plugs being too hot, too cold that will give you a hint on what to do next. One more thing is fcp euro sells the stock bosch plugs for ~$5 each so they're pretty cheap to play around with.Edit - I wanted to clarify it is not the fault of \"every\" bmw tuner out there for spreading gap size information. It could also be because a tuner gives a customer a gap size for their particular setup and that gap size and plug is then recommended by said customer because it works so well on their particular setup and the result is the wrong info is spreaded where is should have just remained for that one particular initial setup. Otherwise tuner recommendations could just be a set of guide lines of what to follow. But at the end of it all my opinion is to read the spark plug gap and data logs for your particular car and make the appropriate changes based on that. Remember the goal is to have the largest gap possible to get the best possible combustion, so if you can run stock gaps (most people should) then I would do so.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceNot really, from what I see we have a bunch of bmw tuners who follow the trend of gapping down plugs based on a generic one size fits all recommendation vs. a tuner who recommends seeing what each individual car needs aka reading the plugs and data logs to look for misfires.

And, my current set will get sent back to them for credit.\n\nI should also mention that stock gaps may not always be suitable for every car under similar circumstances and situations, again this is why reading your plugs and datalogging for misfires is a better way to determine plug gap size and heat range rather than following the pack per say. I am not trying to say this to step on any toes, but I am trying to help you guys out so you don't get misfires or weird stumbles that are plug related, and you will also be saving money running stock plugs compared to the more expensive ngk's.\n\nAnd what might be the stock gap for the M2?

Anyone?I tried some searching but it was l muddied by everyone saying gap tighter, like you said.0.028\" or 0.7 mm, the bosch plugs are also pregapped to this as well.Yeah I hate all the spark plug threads because people are just throwing numbers around without any real basis behind it, and imo people shouldn't follow each other with plug advice just do what your own car needs.Also if you are going to use a gap tool get a bms tool, don't get the amazon or aliexpress ones because you'll just be messing up your brand new plugs, and do not use antiseize.\n\nJust a heads up that FCP says the NGK’s are pre-gapped to 0.030”https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw...plug-ngk-96987\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZM2Just a heads up that FCP says the NGKs are pre-gapped to 0.030https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw...plug-ngk-96987That's the stock gap size for n20's and iirc the new supra but the new supra uses a different plug.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceThat's the stock gap size for n20's and iirc the new supra but the new supra uses a different plug.Well, new plugs gapped to 0.026” fixed the issue.

PM me your email address and I will forward you my copy of the latest version.Regarding your list, none of that is required at that age and mileage, but if you want the \"warm and fuzzy\" feeling, I would do brake fluid and air filter.  Brake fluid used to be every 2 years -- currently on the F87 it's 3 years for the first change, and every 2 years thereafter.I also like to do diff/tranny fluid at 15K intervals (which is overkill, but it makes me happy).\n\nWell, you could consider changing every single consumable item, as well as all service items.

For my 1200 mile service I basically drove it home, drained out the water they call oil, and put in Penzoil Euro 5w40 (LP-01).I dunno. I guess it comes down to what kind of value is actually in this particular service. Maybe services where they don't just change the oil it's worth going in?Not a good idea because if you do not let them have a record of doing oil changes you will have huge issues with warranty claims in regards to the powertrain in the future.Next, you are hugely mistaken when it comes to oil - remember not all oil has to be thick like honey to be considered \"good\" there are tolerances in the engine so you cannot always go thicker, also just because an oil is thin does not mean it is bad for example if you go with a 0w30 or 0w40 but with really good base stocks like a pao or group 5 ester base stock you can get even better shear protection than some crappy 10w60 oils. The twin power turbo 0w30 oil bmw uses is an insanely stout oil coming in with an HTHS of ~3.2- 3.5 which is insanely high for a 30 weight LL01 approved oil. The pennzoil platnium euro 5w40 is actually a very good oil too (I am planning to run this when my warranty is done) and it has an HTHS of 3.8 with the new reformulation. So do not be so quick to judge the 0w30. Also it doesn't matter where you live, there will be no situation where your environment is so hot that it affects the oil's ability to do well and protect your engine. If you are just street driving or spirited driving your oil cooler will keep the oil temps perfectly fine, if you are tracking in a hot environment then yes a thicker oil is recommended. The only thing that environmental temps would influence is your winter weight (the number before the W), in hotter climates you can run a 5w, but either way it does not really matter too much. IMO I would stick with the bmw oil until your warranty is over, that way warranty work will not be a hassle. And remember the bmw oil is actually some really good stuff, and is made by shell just like pennzoil is.So please do not fall into some common misconceptions about oil you can end up damaging you engine or wasting money, I am letting you know this because I see so much bad advice on these car forums, if you want better oil advice you can do more research on bob is the oil guy.PS: there is no such thing as LP 01 it is LL01.Quote:Originally Posted by2020M2CompetitionOP is replacing the LL-01FE 0W-30 with a LL-01 5W40Not what BMW currently recommends, but given the operating conditions an understandable decisionNothing wrong with that, LL01 is better than LL01 FE for protection imo, because FE is for fuel efficiency which means the oils have a lower viscosity for lower friction and this generally leads to formulation with a lower HTHS ratings to allow for less friction and thus better fuel economy. So personally if I were to track a car I would switch to an LL01 oil, but do not count out the twin power turbo oil because it indeed is very very stout, but even still I would switch the pennzoil platnium euro as it has a higher HTHS which offers better protection under high temps and hard driving.Also you are misinformed, the manual may say LL-01 FE is required but there are also other suitable alternatives the manual does not specify because it is too limited in scope the bmw TIS is more accurate, LL-01 approved oils being some of them. Another example is the manual says only 0w30 but you are actually able to use a 5w40 oil as well, as per the bmw TIS. The manual just doesn't specify all of this data because if they did it would be too confusing for a basic bmw owner who doesn't care about all this, and the manual would be huge.Here is the chart showing suitable approvals for the m2:https://www.newtis.info/tisv2/a/en/f...engine/1PSryV8Here are the approved oils with LL01 certifications, this is really important because alot of oils say LL01 on the bottle or LL01 suitable, but are not actually LL01 approved, ams oil comes to mind at the time of writing this, so you have to check with the BMW TIS to be 100% safe.https://www.newtis.info/tisv2/a/en/f...ine/1VnYpiUbyG\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourcePS: there is no such thing as LP 01 it is LL01.Typo.

And I'm going in for service just to protect my warranty.That would be a good move, since you have an M2C and those things are known for a whole abundance of failures: crank hub, valvetronic, oil cooler etc. So if you opted to ditch any of the bmw service at all then if an issue popped up they will make it hell for you to claim warranty.I also recommend you service the oil at half the mileage interval bmw recommends or else the car will not have a long life expectancy as bmw prescribes oil change intervals that are way too long. But the caviot is you should use their oil or an LL01 oil of the same weight, because if there is an engine failure they could do an oil analysis and if the oil is a different weight that could also cause issues with warranty. This was very common practice in the subaru world.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceQuote:Originally Posted bymsdssTypo.

I've decided that I'm ok with the 0w-30 for the meantime since I'm not doing much driving here in the fucking plague state of Texas, and it's about to be \"winter\" and the crisp 85 degree weather will be fine with the BMW recommended oil.I'm looking at my service internals now... 3 years for brake fluid? I've always done once a year... /shrug..anyway.. yeah. all the talk of warranty issues has convinced me. I don't want the drama.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymsdssI'm changing the oil every 3,000. and did a lot of research before choosing the oil I did.

I've always done once a year... /shrug..anyway.. yeah. all the talk of warranty issues has convinced me. I don't want the drama.3000 miles is a good interval, but like I said before 0w30 from bmw is extremely stout and would be fine regardless of where you live even if temps were 50°C. If you tracked your car this would be different and it aid be better to move up to a 40 weight.Brake fluid is 3 years for the first change and after that every 2 years. For street use this is fine, again if you track your car you should do it before every track day or at a maximum every 6 months to avoid water accumulation in the brake fluid.\n\nAlso I should mention, used oil analysis and technical data sheets are much more important for doing research on oil than simply following tends on forums because that leads to notions like \"water like oil\" or \"thicker is better\".  But the most important thing to look at is your own used oil analysis because everyone's driving style is different. For example someone's track analysis might show the oil as inufficient as tbn drops significantly and metal contents are high. But that oil may be fine for a daily driver. So the best thing to do is to do a used oil analysis on your own oil and see if it works in your application. But this would only be a concern once you are done your warranty period so you don't mess up your warranty.Also more recent data is better than older data because oils always go through reformulations, so what's good today might not be good tomorrow. For example Pennzoil platbium euro 5w40 had an hths of 3.6 in the past and just recently they reformulated to get api sp approval which brought hths to 3.8.Overall for most people remaining after the warranty on bmw twin power turbo 0w30 would be more than sufficient, but I don't recommend to use this oil after the warranty period not because of its inability to protect compared to another oil, but because of the price. Twin power turbo from the dealer is so expensive compared to Pennzoil platbium euro 5w40 when it's on sale ($29 for a 5L jug in Canada).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyWell, noting that it's all fully synthetic oil, it doesn't noticeably degrade at 100F when designed to cope with over 200F.

I had it done at like 32k because free maintenance is over at 36 so it was last chance. I think conventional wisdom for these cars is 30k or earlier if tuned.\n\nYeah.. it's usually 30k mileage and up that you'd have to change. If it was part of the free service included and they changed earlier, nbd. But if you're paying out of pocket at 23k mileage only, then that's suspect cuz it's well in advance.\n\nOP you need to give us complete info.Where are you from?Did you buy the car new or used?What do you mean your service warranty is out at 23k?

The official maintenance plan says that spark plugs should be done at 3rd oil change (not including the break-in change) or 30K miles IIRC. For most of us with 2017+, this means the final oil change before maintenance plan expires. I asked last time I was in since it was technically my third change (including the break-in) and they told me it was scheduled for my next visit. Should definitely not have been charged if you had the plan active still.\n\nYep exactly!

But I would think that the car would have notified you for service since it usually goes by time elapsed OR mileage.Not sure though since I haven't personally reached that mileage yet for the spark plugs service and 3rd dealer oil change\n\nShortly after getting the E46 I realised the plugs hadn't be changed for nearly 10 years/60k miles. They did not look pretty when I changed them, but the car ran fine.It ran better afterwards though.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bynioh_lbbm2Sorry man but I don't think you were misled by your dealer.If your car is a MY2017 and maintenance expired in November 2019 that is possible if the first owner bought the car in Nov 2016 which aligns with the timeframe for a MY2017 car being soldSucks but it is what it is.

I’m at the dealer getting my 2nd oil service done, and they’re also  changing spark plugs.  My car is a 2018 with a little over 21k miles. It’s all covered in the warranty, but I was thinking that was kind of early, maybe not.\n\nI'm in LA, 2017 M2 MT with 14K mikes, maintenance last month was 3rd oil change along with brake fluid and plugs. Purchased in February 2017, so this is inline with what was said... 3rd oil change, change plugs. Low mileage for plugs. This was my last free service.My prior N54 135 was 45K for plugs and not tied to oil changes. I had to bring up plugs to my SA before my CPO maintenance expired.\n\nHere's what I ended up paying:Total cost of service: 897.02 (Labor: 456.18, Parts: 396.33, Tax: 44.51)This includes the engine service, intake filter, spark plugs, windshield wipers, and key battery.

I know for 100 octane is decreases the spark plugs life sooner.Interesting question I've been thinking about all morning.I don't think you'd be adding near enough ethanol for degradation to be a concern. What would the mix be, like 1 gallon e85 to a tank of 91?I was thinking about having to re-tune for the higher ethanol content, but then realize it would only be a gallon or so you're adding, so you'd probably be fine. Though not sure how a tune would handle that (if you're tuned) if it'd need more injector or decrease power by not having enough fuel, or if it's not enough to matter.Another part I've been thinking about... if you have access to e85, why not run the full e85 and the bm3 e30 tune? I'd save you the hassle of mixing. But you seemed to have answered that already, you're concerned with e85 deteriorating parts of your car.\n\nRight it would just be 1 gallon but I dont know what overall octane that will average it to. as for the bm3 e30 tune I think u can only fill a certain amount.

The reason why I'm going for the Chevron product is because the bmw product is a relabeled Chevron techron product and is easily available here for a reasonable price.While all the other products like redline néed to be imported making it crazy expensive.\n\nI wasn't aware I needed to use such.

Is this once a year, or at a certain mileage?You don't really need to use it, but I'm running a non top tier gas (because husky 94 is the only real and consistent 94 octane in Canada imo) so might as well.Use it every 3000 miles max twice per oil change. I personally would only do it once before and oil change because this will cause alot of crap to get suspended in your oil, so I would want it to get flushed after using it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byVisualEchoI wasn't aware I needed to use such.

But I want to run a second tank of fresh gas afterwards.\n\nI just bought a bottle of fuel system cleaner from my local dealer, it is no longer labeled with techron but the bottom of the bottle has the chevron logo and the instructions are still exactly the same as techron. I poured the whole bottle as per the instructions (a bit more than the 1 oz per gallon ratio but that is for motor cycles or small fuel tank vehicles equivalent to motor cycles) and filled the tank with husky 94 octane fuel. Once this tank is done I will run it through a tank of plain gas then it will be time for an oil change.Images coming tomorrow depending if I can upload from my phone without having to upload to imgur first.\n\nOk guys here are images of the new fuel system cleaner bottle from bmw, it still shares the same part number but no mention of techron which is kind of weird. The chevron logo is still on the bottom of the bottle though.\n\nI'm guessing this is needed due to the sulphur content of fuel in NA?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyI'm guessing this is needed due to the sulphur content of fuel in NA?Not really, imo sulfur in gasolines in NA are relatively low due to strict gov't regulations so that is not really a huge issue.The issue comes if you are not using top tier gas (even though I don't believe this is an issue wither since the gov't mandates enough detergents to make even these gases ok), or ethanol based fuels can cause the injectors to gum up (especially in high humidity areas where ethanol absorbs alot of water). Another factor could be due to the use of high NOACK oils causing alot of carbon build up in the cylinders.These factors shouldn't be a huge issue until higher mileage but I rather start treating these issues before they get really bad. For instance with carbon build up it is better to start when the carbon is thin because once it becomes thick and heavily deposited there is no easy way to remove it. I also want to keep the fuel system clean and healthy.\n\nJust wanted to do a quick update. I have put a few hundred KM on the car so far and there has been no issues with the fuel system cleaner, it has not made the car stumble or have any running issues and my gauges (MHD) have not shown any weird issues even after the car has sat outside and heat soaked the intercooler to 65ºC - no feed back knock so it does not mess with octane.Anyways I also do not feel too much of a difference but my car only has 8000 km on it so it is unlikely I would have any heavy build up in the fuel system or engine to really detriment performance in any way that a fuel system cleaner could make a noticeable difference. But I am doing it as a precaution to always keep the fuel system in tip top shape, essentially combating any build up at small levels when it is easy to eliminate instead of waiting too long and having the build up get so bad that fuel system cleaners will have no effect.\n\nIt might be interesting to find out what it does to the other BMW I own: a 181k mile 2002 e46 330ci...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyIt might be interesting to find out what it does to the other BMW I own: a 181k mile 2002 e46 330ci...Yeah that would be cool to see if you notice anything, alot of bmw owners with higher mileage say it's night and day. Plus it's reasonably cheap to buy this, so why not.\n\nSome say to use it a few tanks prior to your oil change b/c the product or combusted product gets past the rings and into the oil.Not sure if this is true but doesn't hurt and the timing works out.Anyone know if this is true or not or am i propagating internet urban legends ?I use it every now and then when I remember but never notice a difference.

That is why they suggest you do not use the fuel system cleaner more than 2 times per oil change interval.You do not have to use a full tank of plain gas before the oil change you just have to go through the fuel tank with the fuel system cleaner in it and refill before the oil change. But if you want to be more cautious like I am doing then you go through the initial tank of fuel with the cleaner in it, refill and go through the tank of plain fuel, refill and then go get your oil changed. Multiple tanks would better purge any remnants of fuel system cleaner out, but it is not necessary imo because top tier gas like chevron uses techron in it but at a more diluted level. So it really is unnecessary to go through more than 1 tank of plain gas.There was also used oil analysis on BOBITG after running fuel system cleaners and the results were fine, no oil degradation. The oil did its job trapping the contaminants.I use the bmw fuel system cleaner because techron is not available here and the bmw dealer is selling these to me for a really good deal. Also because using the bmw certified stuff won't cause any warranty issues if anything ever cropped up, and it was designed for our cars unlike alot of the junk on the market. The only brands that I know really works is techron/bmw rebranded and redline. The other things on the market are either too dilute or too agressive.Nothing that you add to the fuel system cleaner will clean the valves since no fuel sprays there. It just cleans the fuel injection tract: tank, lpfp, hoses, hpfp, and injectors, along with the cylinder and piston tops from build up.Yes it technically is not necessary with top tier gas or even strictly gov't mandated non-top tier gas like husky 94 here in Canada, because of the already added detergents. But I just like to be extra cautious and it can't hurt to add fuel system cleaner once a year before an oil change, like I said before it is easier to remove deposits and build up if there is very little compared to when it builds up and becomes really thick.At the end of the day it is up to each individual owner whether or not they go the extra mile.",

    "title": "The Ultimate Wiper Hivemind Upgrade Thread",
    "content": "This is gonna be a hodgepodge of my thoughts. I don't feel like spending more time proof-reading and editing this. So please excuse if it comes off a bit scattered an inelegant.So the OEM wipers suck. My M2 is 22 months old. 8 months of which I didn't drive my car because it was getting repaired from an accident. Probably another 2 months total it was in a shop getting upgrades. And probably a bunch more of ownership time I wasn't driving in situations that require wipers. In my experience, wipers should last much longer than this.The problems I'm having is the wipers chatter bad and leave streaks now. Even worse when there is some salt on the windows.In my previous vehicle I found the best combination was RainX 2-1 washer fluid, and their Fusion wiper blades. However both of these are no longer available. Seems that the fluid was discontinued, because it's become ridiculously hard to find. And the other fluids do not compare to it. Either because they have too high of a freezing point, don't offer water beading, or include bug&tar solvents... And for what happened to the blades I like, RainX doesn't make those blades for our car.For fluid, on paper it seems that Prestone 3-1 is comparable. It's a little more costly. Almost twice as expensive. But it includes water beading formula and doesn't include bug&tar solvents. I find the bug&tar fluid is an unnecessary solvent. Let's say it eats through bugs, it's just gonna smear bug guts all over your window. If bug are your problem, don't use your wipers and wash your car. Also I rather not have solvents in the fluid as I feel it eats through ceramic coating. Even the OEM BMW fluid has destroyed my ceramic coating and I believe that just has alcohol in it.Ok, wiper blades. My requirements are that they last and look good. They can't be an eyesore. Some have big bulky attachment points. This is my first time using the I&L connector, previous car was J-hook, and it seems the bulky attachment isn't an issue with I&L but we'll see.RainX has 4 blade options for our car:RainX Arch: Is an entry level blade. I'm not an entry level man, so no thanksRainX Water Repellancy: What you do with these is run the blades for a few minutes on a dry window after you first install them. This applies a water beading coating to the window. I think this is a stupid way to accomplish this. After a little while, the coating wears off the blades and is useless. I find it's better to apply a ceramic coating and/or use water beading washer fluid to accomplish this. The blades are around $19 each.RainX Silicone Endura: These are their new top line product. They use a silicone wiper blade. I haven't used them, but they seem really nice. These have a symmetrical pyramid shape to them.RainX Silicone Advantage: These are the same as the Endura, but have an asymmetrical shape to them. Here is a picture of what I'm talking about. These are $34 each. And are available at my local Advanced Auto with a $20 discount, so this is what I am going to give a try.Additionally, another OEM+ upgrade brand I found is Trico. However, they have so many options available that I gave up trying to figure out their differences and pick one. I believe they generally are cheaper than the $34/ea RainX ones though.https://www.tricoproducts.com/find-w...2018-m2-743725Ok, that's it. I wasn't going to purchase new fluid and blades for another couple weeks. Just because I don't have a low fluid warning. I can make do with my current blades for now. And there is other more important stuff I needed to take care of. But writing this post got me excited to buy these things. So I'm heading to the store right after I submit this post. Will update with my experience.And if anyone else has a better blade they recommend, leave a comment with it. I really only did an hour or so of research and am posting my findings and thoughts. So there may be something better I'm missing.\n\nSo I did end up purchasing the RainX Advantage blade, and I'm not happy with them. They have an ugly dumb connector that I refuse to have to look at everyday. Will be returning them tomorrow. I have a feeling there isn't going to be anything out there that resolves this, because all blades I've seen have universal mounting brackets that accept adapters to different blade types, causing the mounting point to become excessively large for a single applicationHere are some pictures compared to stock\n\nhave you tried Bosch icons?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bynioh_lbbm2have you tried Bosch icons?Tried them, no.

But thanks for the insight. I'm gonna redo the ceramic coating this spring, which involves polishing the window. So hopefully that helps. I can probably hold off on new blades until then too. It's just a small top section of the passenger side that streaks, and the chattering I can live with as it's only in certain conditions it appears.Quote:Originally Posted bynioh_lbbm2make sure youre cleaning your wiper blades too. Personally I find the OEM blades very good but we don't have the same weather and salt over here californiaI wipe them with a microfiber when I manually wash the car. When going through the auto wash, I run the wipers a few times in an attempt to clean them. I'm wondering if I can find a more durable squeegee material strip and slide that into the current frames. Maybe I could've taken the squeegee out of the RainX blades I purchased and used that.Quote:Originally Posted bytux2005I found the mounting bracket for the Bosch Icons to be very similar to OEMReally? This is what your'e talking about, right?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAnthony1s...Really? This is what your'e talking about, right?Yes, I did have a look again tonight with the original OEM wiper blades vs the Icons. I hadn't noticed how much more plastic there was on the wiper blade part rather than the arm attachment point. I do now see the size difference but I can't say that I particularly noticed the size difference on the car. I don't think the extra plastic moves the arm further away from the glass, i.e. height of the mounting point is the same but there is more plastic running along the wiper blade at the attachment point.Actually I found the OEM blades were usually least effective at arm attachment point (i.e. they'd often leave a streak there while the ends of the blades would sweep cleanly) and the Icons are better. Of course, this isn't really a fair comparison since I'm using new Icons vs 2+ year old OEM (although I noticed the poor cleaning at the attachment for the last year).I would offer to take a photo the next time I take the car out but unfortunately I'm not really seeing any daylight with the car at the moment, my commute to and from the train station is always in the dark at the moment.\n\nI use nothing but Bosch MicroEdge for temperate weather.\n\nI just bought the rainx latitude 2 in 1 blades, they come in tomorrow.

That's the path I'm going to take and I think is the best option.Previously, I don't know if I was talking about it here, but I was talking about taking the strip off the rainx blade and putting it on the bmw blade. I took a quick glance when I was washing my car the other day and don't think the strip is removable. Maybe it is, I really didn't look at it for more than a split second.But either way, I think the FCP deal beats that option out of the water.

Mine is DCT, its like something hitting the transmission tunnel (a proper clunk) during light 1-2 or 2-3 shifts.  Or downshifts, makes me wonder if it's just a mount. , or a loose shaft.  My car has less miles than yours, I looked underneath the car, its surgically clean.  Its annoying as hell.  Does not really affect how it drives though.  Thoughts yourself?\n\nHonestly this just sounds like a regular/normal noise caused by driveline lash.  My 128i does this (with and without an LSD installed).  My E36 M3 did it.  Driven multiple E46 M3s that did it.  Happened in my old RX-8 also.Google \"Driveline thud lash BMW\" and see all the hits you get.  For the most part is people that don't have experience with these cars or other similar cars with a RWD drivetrain.  Sure there are some cases where there's a problem, but it's super rare IMO.",

So it's probably better just to stick to the exact same weight.Quote:Originally Posted bysharpmoneyfor non track driving how much worse off is the FE oil with the 3.0 instead of 3.5 HTHS?That's a really hard question, and one that's probably best answered by a used oil analysis.

You will get severe condenstation build up and your oil will turn milky. It's probably best to at least get 1-2 long trips per week to help burn (evaporate) out this water.

Nonetheless, after I received them, I lifted the car with the new adapters to verify a good fit of the adapters into the jack points under the car. As you can see, the fit is perfect. What I enjoy most of these stands is how lifting the car with a jack and securing it with a stand, all in one process, is so easy, not to mention the robust construction providing a very solid base.I store my two stands in a large, Harbor Freight canvas tool bag, which makes transporting the stands very easily to car meets. The interchangeable lift point adapters also make these versatile to use on other cars.Recommendations:1. Low profile jack.2. Factory ride height setting, otherwise you will need to lift the car first with a jack, place a 2x6 board under the front wheel in order to create space under the lift point and the Safejack adapter.",

If you do it elsewhere and the CBS is reset, you are unfortunately giving up that free oil change. I get where you are coming from, but this is how it works.I change my oil in between BMW's recommended service.BMW - 1200 MilesMe - 5000 Miles (don't reset CBS)BMW - 10000 MilesMe - 15000 Miles (don't reset CBS)etc...\n\nAlso don't forget that regardless of the mileage on the CBS, the dealer will also change the oil once per year under the maintenance plan, as should you if you're not driving enough to trigger personal/CBS mileage guidelines.\n\nIn Yoorup, the service intervals are 24 months...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byrocketman99Also don't forget that regardless of the mileage on the CBS, the dealer will also change the oil once per year under the maintenance plan, as should you if you're not driving enough to trigger personal/CBS mileage guidelines.Age is part of CBS so it will tell you to change oil at 10k or 1 year, whatever comes first.\n\nI believe CBS is more than mileage and time and may include things like driving style, RPM, etc. I have had mine go off sooner than 10K and to that point BMW will also change the oil more often if the CBS tells them.There is also a window, which I believe is ~1,500 miles or so, meaning you can schedule the oil change sooner if the car is within that window.One last item, CBS items are allowed to be bundled together. Recently (April), I was in for a CBS oil change and the CBS showed my brake flush due in August. The Service Advisor asked if I wanted that done too. I ask, if that was allowed--meaning would I have to pay for it--since it was way out of the window mentioned above. They said that they are allowed to bundle items that are close together. Guess, it helps keep costs down like repeat visits, loaners, etc.\n\nWho cares about the dealer. Change the oil yourself when needed. I only go to tdealer if there is something under warranty, or a recall.The rest I can do better myself.\n\nOkay, so a couple things on this topic.The 1 year interval is gone on 2018's...I change my oil on my own normally after 2 track days and don't reset the OCI.  But... I was having some other work done and asked the shop doing the work to change the oil.I was most frustrated by the dealer's lack of clarity, as I setup the appointment for an oil change and an exhaust rattle.  They didn't mention the oil wasn't changed.  I caught it when I picked the car up (after being there for 4 days waiting on a warranty part).  If they had asked, I would have protested, but likely would have paid for an oil change due to my schedule.I don't begrudge the dealer over following corporate policy.  I'm just saying the policy is asinine...  They can tell if the oil has been changed by a BMW dealer, and this is just a scam to prevent BMW from having to perform service that is supposedly included in the maintenance plan.The independent shop is going to hook me up with an oil change after having a talk with their manager.-rant over-\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byStu2k2Okay, so a couple things on this topic.The 1 year interval is gone on 2018's...I change my oil on my own normally after 2 track days and don't reset the OCI.

They didn't mention the oil wasn't changed.  I caught it when I picked the car up (after being there for 4 days waiting on a warranty part).  If they had asked, I would have protested, but likely would have paid for an oil change due to my schedule.I don't begrudge the dealer over following corporate policy.  I'm just saying the policy is asinine...  They can tell if the oil has been changed by a BMW dealer, and this is just a scam to prevent BMW from having to perform service that is supposedly included in the maintenance plan.The independent shop is going to hook me up with an oil change after having a talk with their manager.-rant over-Yeah, I'd be annoyed that my service advisor didn't call me to at least let me know the car didn't qualify for an oil change. $150 to have them do it when my time is more valuable is worth it.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byRocketBootsinteresting thing is, the CBM still shows I need an oil change ~10k miles, which makes you wonder what the CBM is really monitoring... certainly not the condition of the oil...Its not got its own oil lab under the bonnet, it has no idea about the oil so the computer goes off time and/or duration and type of journey/how the car is driven.\n\nI changed it myself, and sent it out for analysis.

When you top up the oil, signal from level sensor would change hence extending the miles to go on the service indicator.BP\n\nHad a similar issue. Car had just gone passed the 36K mark so it was out of the maintenance plan so I would be paying for it anyway. I scheduled a service and I expressed to the advisor that I was planning on going to the track (would be the 2nd track day on the same service interval).

Not sure if that damaged it...End up with: the screw (red arrow) with \"RIBE 8.8\" on cap cannot be get out, both direction, it spins but not moving up/down.Searching Google / RealOEM / newTIS did not reveal what this bolt is, how I can get new ones and trying to fix this problem.I hope what went broken is the screw (disposable), not the screw hole part (which is a part of the body)...Has anyone encoutered the same problem before? What is the solution to this?Also, anyone know the part number for the screw (RIBE 8.8)?

I got home and removed all my luggage.  I did a once over of the car and happened to see a fresh drop of oil on my garage floor. I got under the car and holy hell the bolt was on so tight.  Once it became loose, it just spun.  It won't come off at all. Anyways, I see the pan online going for $850-$1200.  Most of them being priced in the upper $800's.I've spoken to 3 shops and waiting on 1 to call back.  The first shop said he would attempt to re-thread the pan, but couldn't promise it would work.  He also stated he never accepts parts brought in by customers.  He didn't provide a quote.  The 2nd shop quoted me $3000+ for the pan, bolts, gasket, oil, etc. installed.  They refuse customer provided parts as well.  The explanation \"We can't warranty the parts provided by the customer, therefore we do not accept them\".I'm in the SF Bay area and trying to find a shop that will re-thread the pan or accept customer bought parts.  It doesn't make sense for me to purchase the same oil pan for $1200 when it is available for $850ish at a ton of online retailers.  Also, if anyone has a link to a DIY for the pan replacement, that would be awesome.  I have been looking for an hour now and don't see much of anything.\n\nHave you considered taking it back to the establishment that caused the damage and simply indicate that you noticed oil on the garage floor and you'd like it checked ? Bring in your original receipt showing date/time. At this point you'll have to adapt to whatever event(s) occur. If they claim it's damaged then ask to speak with a manager and calmly/politely discuss options. If they say everything looks fine then politely request if an employee can accompany you to look underneath (be inquisitive about where the oil is coming from). Key here is to stay calm and act as if you have no knowledge of the damage. Ultimately you want to walk out of there with a manager/owner acknowledging the damage and his commitment to rectify (in writing).  Damage should be covered by their insurance. Timing is key, go back ASAP.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///MonikaHave you considered taking it back to the establishment that caused the damage and simply indicate that you noticed oil on the garage floor and you'd like it checked ?

Service departments should be open but sales departments in many places are closed.\n\nShouldn't be an issue in terms of getting all your warrantied services done during the warranty period.  I've been late a few months in the past and BMW has honored all my services.  I'm sure your service advisor will be accommodating with everything that's going on.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bycb804You should be fine with waiting a month and maybe even longer.

You even have time to send the oil to Blackstone Labs to prove it to yourself, if you like.With that mileage, and no track days, you can expect that oil to last 2 years easy.\n\nIn some countries, the intervals are 2 years.

    "content": "So I am finally getting close to 2000km or 1200 miles and am going to get the break in service soon!2 questions:first, just confirming oil service and differential fluid change are what should be done at the break in service? (the canadian service manual curiously only describes break in service for the m5 and m8 and is silent on the m2c)second, is it open season after the break in service? Can I drive it like I stole it or should I gradually progress to higher rpms, more throttle and more steady driving?\n\nI drove it like I stole it after 500 miles, so I would say have at it! There are a huge range of believes/theories on break in of vehicles. BMW says limit rpms until 1200 miles, so open game after.  Do what makes you comfortable and happy.\n\nWhat I like to do after break-in is open it up more and more and vary the rpms even more but higher in the rpm range.  Everything will seat in so much better and quicker by stressing the engine progressively.   These are fast cars so unless you stay in 1st and 2nd gear and scream the engine, it’s hard to really stress the engine out and stay anywhere near legal speed limits.I turned the traction control off last night on my asphalt drive way that is long and goes up hill.  I wanted to see how easy it would brake traction and at 1/3 throttle it took off and left a 10’ patch before I even knew it was letting loose and I am still breaking in my car with lower rpm’s.    It was impressive to say the least but I now have two landing stripes on my driveway.I have been driving awd 911’s for so long I forgot the joys of being a rwd hooligan.\n\nIt was open season for me.  One of the best afternoons of ownership!  I had my first HPDE about a week later.\n\nWarm it up then go for it. Cars that are driven regularly and hard always feel the strongest.\n\nI was already routinely going to 5500 ish rpm so the extra a few times to 7000 after the break in was no big deal. You can't really run this car that high frequently anyway as you'll get in trouble. So some redline shifts once in a while is what this car was built for.Below is what the M2 gets for service.

I've read a lot of back and forth on this.I have a Dinan stage 1 tune on my 2018  LCI M2 and I was told that I should have the plugs changed at least every 30K miles.Last time I had them changed was 33K - car now has 59K - I don't track it - seems to run fine.But when I *do* get on it, I want the car to run at its best.What do you guys think?Lastly, was quoted $498 out the door - is that a good price?\n\n30k miles is the official interval.15-20k is recommended for tuned cars depending on aggression of the tune.Personally I'd do it every 15 just to make things easier to keep track along with 5k oil changes.$498 is including labor and parts? If so I'd say that's a bit on the high endPlugs are about $100 and should be about 2 hours of labor.\n\nNGK 1 step colder spark plugs 97506 are great for tuned cars.

Hoping you guys can give me some advice and insight.My m2 comp has 853 miles and, a week a go, I had the windows down and heard a fluttering/shuddering type noise coming from the front. The flutter/shudder noise is apparent at lower speeds (between 30 to 40 mph) and only while accelerating. If I had to describe the noise it sounds like a rubber flap was loose and the wind going through causes a sort of shudder sound.There does not seem to be any loss of power and no codes have popped up. I took my car to BMW to have it checked out and get the run-in service done. The shop foreman was able to replicate the sound and has been in contact with BMW Engineering. I was initially told there was some sort of leak in the exhaust system. However, after discussions with BMW Engineering they ordered and replaced the Vanos units on the exhaust side, exhaust camshaft lifters, and exhaust camshaft bearings.What do you guys think? Has anyone else experienced any issues similar??Thanks!!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFCTrs4Hello all.

If it goes away after this then I guess well have an answer and more knowledge to add to the group.Please update us with results!\n\nUpdate: my CA called me this morning to say BMW authorized an engine replacement. Engine should be here soon. Did not see that coming.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFCTrs4Update: my CA called me this morning to say BMW authorized an engine replacement. Engine should be here soon. Did not see that coming.That's insane. Can you share the details as to what happened?\n\nwoah! what happened?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMMMBRAPThat's insane. Can you share the details as to what happened?My CA called me on Wednesday to let me know that my car was ready to be picked. The tech reported that the noise was no longer present. When I went to pick up my car, I had a nice discussion with the tech. When I asked what exactly was the problem, he told me there was an issue with Cylinder 1 and the crankshaft. Cylinder 1 was misfiring, but it was not throwing a code and was not causing the car to lose power or drive impaired. He said they tried to isolate the issue, but were just guessing to try and fix the problem. Bmw, instead of throwing a bunch of parts at the engine, opted to replace the engine.Since I picked up the car, I haven't heard the fluttering noise, but I haven't really driven the car much. I'm hoping everything is good now - definitely don't want to have bring the car back to the dealer again.\n\nA new engine for a misfire on no1?Woh how bad are techs these days?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydoughboyA new engine for a misfire on no1?Woh how bad are techs these days?It's almost as if mistakes happen and nothing can ever be 100%. That's why warranties exist.\n\nGod damn that sucks, glad you are getting the motor replaced on the first try without having to go back and forth and fight with these techs.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydoughboyA new engine for a misfire on no1?Woh how bad are techs these days?The tech was getting guidance from BMW engineering, and BMW engineering wasn't sure what the cause of the misfire was. Instead of throwing tons of parts at the engine to try and fix, BMW authorized a full engine replacement.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceGod damn that sucks, glad you are getting the motor replaced on the first try without having to go back and forth and fight with these techs.Yeah that's definitely the silver lining. Put 50 miles on her today and no noise so that's great.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byFCTrs4Quote:Originally Posted byF87sourceGod damn that sucks, glad you are getting the motor replaced on the first try without having to go back and forth and fight with these techs.Yeah that's definitely the silver lining.

    "content": "Fortunately I am still required to drive my OG to work albeit a short distance of 2.5 miles or so each way.The dash says a service is due in June.I am doubtful I will be able to get it done due to lockdown and think that as the car is so low in mileage (only just passed 20k and it's a 2016 chassis) that no harm will come to it in real terms.But reassurance is nice\n\nI'd check with dealer anyway. Here, our dealer is keen on a rotating limited tech staff staying a bit apart and the shop.Service writers rotate out also and have space; and they take appointments, so customers are not all together. Might be surprised...as I was here.\n\nIn the US, most dealership service are still open, but that may be different in the UK.But I won't worry about the service due light, the car will be just fine, especially with the low mileage.  Just get it done with the service department is back open.\n\nThanks\n\nI don't understand what your problem is when you say \"I am doubtful I will be able to get it done due to lockdown\" Do you mean because your dealer is closed? Or because you are afraid of them contaminated your car? Or is it some other reason?My two local dealers are still open for service. Just about every week I get an email from them advertising they're open for service and offering specials and discounts. I think they're trying to bring in service sales to compensate for the lack of auto sales. They're even advertising free pickup and delivery of your vehicle, so you don't have to see anyone. Which, I understand isn't super helpful if you're concerned of them contaminating your car and it not being sanitized properly before you get in it.I was thinking about this back in early March. When there was less known about the coronavirus and it was being said it lasted on surfaces for 7-14 days. Now they say it's even less for surfaces. 2hrs for fabrics and 2 days for metals and glass...Let them pick up my car after 2 days of me not driving it, then not drive it myself for 2 days after they drop it off. To make sure any surface contamination is dead and gone.With your short commute to work, take a taxi, walk, or ride a bike to/from as time passes.\n\nerm because in the UK we actually locked down? As in no one is out in the street hugging each other, or opening car show rooms, or just about anything else normal.So I meant I couldn't physically get my car serviced (by BMW).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by3t3perm because in the UK we actually locked down?

So I'm hoping to choose the best reviewed local dealer, give them my VIN number and request my remaining two services?",

None of it cost me anything, but the service advisor said that when they \"read the key\" that's what they were told to do.I guess the plugs have a service interval life based on age?  I thought it was strange.  There were no reported issues, or any stored codes that would have suggested a problem.\n\nYeah plugs every 3 years or a certain km rating (can't remember the number). I had mine done at 6500 km.\n\nThe last time I went in for service (~9k miles) they told me the car called for the filters and plugs but said at such a low mileage it was probably totally unnecessary so I declined it. Had it been free I'd obv have taken it but my '17 isn't under the free maintenance anymore.",

I therefore already had my fair share of oil changes and services done on cars in the UK before leaving.Having lived now in the US for many years, I would say that there are three things that are significantly different between what's considered normal servicing between Europe and the US:Fuel QualityOil Change IntervalsTire LifeFuelPump fuel quality in the US sucks in all states, but especially in those on the West Coast. I'm not going to be drawn into an argument on this topic, but I stand by my claim based on extensive research into standards in different countries that US 93 AKI is roughly equivalent to European standard fuel which is rated at 95 RON. European premium fuel is far better with a RON of between 97 and 99. I realise that this statement goes agains that established (incorrect) thinking that US 93 = EU 99, and I'll say one more thing about it. AKI is a ratio, and the important thing which we're never told isn't the RON, it's the difference between MON and RON; the larger the better for high compression / forced induction engines.Important to this topic though, is that US Fuel also has quite a bit higher sulphur content, which has a negative impact on oil life. I'm not an expert on why this happens, but it does have an impact and that explains point 2:Oil change intervalMy first car was a 1985 MY original Mini, and the manufacturer specified an oil change interval of 12,000 miles / 12 months. I actually did changes more frequently than this at 10,000 miles, but in the UK, I never heard of anyone who changed more frequently if they didn't track their car. It's important to note that in the original Mini, the gearbox shares oil with the engine!My second car was a 1992 MY Peugeot 405 Mi16x4; a homologation special 4wd version of the Mi16. It had a manufacturers specified oil change interval of 10,000 miles / 12 months, which I admit is closer to typical in the US.My third car was a 1999 MY Peugeot 406 Coupé (3.0 V6), and this had manufacturers specified oil change interval of 20,000 miles / 24 months! I was surprised by this, but followed the manufacturers guidelines and sold the car with 180,000 miles and it never burned a drop of oil the whole time I had it.At the same time as the 406 Coupé, I also had a 2003 MY AP2 Honda S2000 (AP2 was still a 1,997cc F20C in Europe; for better or worse we never got the 2,157cc F22C1 engine). Honda recommended an oil change interval of 7,500 miles / 12 months. And as we all know, the F20C is one of the most highly strung NA engines ever in a production car. I never did 12,000 miles in a year, and I switched to fully synthetic higher performance oil, but I did change the oil only 1 time per year.One point that is very important to note is that European car manufacturers also switched to recommending either Semi Synthetic or Fully synthetic oil blends many many years before that was the norm in the US.Tire LifeThis is probably self explanatory... The US is BIG, with lots of straight roads. In the UK, it is quite typical to get about 12,000 ~ 15,000 miles out of a set of tires on a normal passenger car. I got 30,000 miles out of the tires on my first car here, and I thought I drove it hard.At the time I left the UK, all cars came with summer tires. Most cars in the US come with all season tires. All seasons would make sense in the UK as well, and that may be the case now, but this also might be a contributing factor to tire life in the UK.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byPackPride85I don't have much faith in BMW ever recommending what is best for the engine after the 15k mile oil change debacle.You can guess, but we just don't know.The engineers seemed to win on the 10W-60 in the high revving S engines, which of course didn't stop them from blowing up in class-action lawsuit inducing numbers.\n\nThey don't do that in YOORUP. So what is it about the driving environment in NA that destroys engines?Aside from the fuel - which appears to be a mix of ethanol and sulphur...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyThey don't do that in YOORUP. So what is it about the driving environment in NA that destroys engines?Aside from the fuel - which appears to be a mix of ethanol and sulphur...Yes, the fuel, and until quite recently, the quality of the oil used.Sorry, I wrote a lot and didn't summarise.... brevity isn't a strength!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by2020M2CompetitionAs mentioned above that is what BMW currently recommends for the M2C in the USABMW LL-01 FESAE 0W-30BMW supposedly switched to a lower viscosity in an effort to reduce emissions and improve fuel economyActually there is an EU spec M version oil: BMW M LL12 FE 0W-30.Made by Shell based on Pureplus technology.

I probably wouldn't run it in the S55 though.I doubt there is a lot of difference in 0w-30s that meet BMW specs, all the good oils are all produced by similar processes and have similar additive packs unless you get into more exotic stuff.",

My question was in regards to is this normal.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to think by leaving it in auto all the time that it only wipes when water is detected as to not scratch your windshield on a dry wipe.  So let me modify my question to is this normal?\n\nDoesn't sound normal. Has your windshield ever been replaced by third party? It's possible you need your front camera calibrated\n\nThanks for the response.  Its the original windshield so either its the camera you mentioned or possibly auto wipers to BMW is intermittent (explaining why its swipes 1 time on startup even when dry just like it would when you first turn it on which to me would be a oversight in software programming) meant to be turned off every time before you turn off the car unlike auto headlights which I just leave in auto perpetually.  I asked the question because Im taking the car in for service and was wondering if its normal or something I should have them take a look at.",

Is this something that they might've over looked during preparation for the car at time of delivery?

I've never had an AC problem in my M2 but in my F30 I had an issue pop up once where on a humid day the AC and fans would be on the max setting but no cold air was coming out of the vents.

In their FAQ they say they consider it \"the cost of doing business to keep customers coming back\"So maybe it's a business expense and a tax write-off for them? Doubt it, but that'd be a cool loophole if it was.I was looking for Castrol SRF and came into a guy on a Porsche forum saying that he uses the guarantee for brake fluid and oil, that's how I came across this. But they don't have the brake fluid in stock, so there is nothing I need right now to take advantage of this. But maybe someone else here can.\n\nThey probably don't have that many people that actually take advantage of it.  I've bought several things from them over the years - their shipping location used to be close enough to just go pick my orders up. Brake parts are probably the only things I've ever ordered that qualified and I just didn't think of it when I needed new brake parts.I would have never realized it was good for fluids though.  The idea of buying an oil change kit once and returning the old oil for free oil changes \"forever\" is pretty appealing. I wonder if I can just drive it down to Milford.  it's a bit of a hike - but not compared to 90 bucks for fresh oil and filter\n\nYep it's been well touted for years. You just have to go through the hassle of sending your old stuff back from fluids to partsIt's worth it for wear items like pads or windshield wipers. For me personally I wouldn't go as far as oil due to the hassle\n\nWow. It's too bad they don't sell track pads.. They have some ferodo ds2500, but not the 1.11. Shame",

The issue with leaving the oil for a long time and changing is some of the fluid fins in the gearbox, the gunk gets unsettled and blocks the veins which then can leave a gearbox useless. This usually happens on high mileage automatic gearboxes that has never had an oil change and then suddenly has an oil change.People then blame the new oil or the gearbox manufacturer when it's neithers fault.On auto boxes, you either change the fluid regularly, or not at all.DCT doesn't have this issue.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byWattensYeah it would have to be the normal Auto box.

It's not so much a mileage thing for me.When mine gets to around 5 years maximum (if I still have it then), I'll get it flushed and changed.From a wear aspect, although the filter and magnetism should stop most of these issues from causing more problems, it's not 100%, and to also test at the same time and measure what wear metals and how much are present at the time to see if there is a more costly issue starting to creep up.No gearbox at the moment is \"fill for life\" in any technology. What is fill for life? From an OEM aspect, it is merely the warranty period and nothing more. Usually, when cars finish their manufacturer's warranty, it's not their problem anymore. OEM's are under pressure to get fleet business as that is where the market is going in the developed world. If there is less maintenance in the \"fleet period\" usually less than 5 years, it makes that vehicle more attractive to the fleet companies, the issues will happen to the cars but from their perspective, hopefully after the fleet companies have turned the vehicle over to a second-hand private owner or the private buyer who bought it new has upgraded to the next model before any issues have occurred.Then the spare parts division kicks in to play with very expensive genuine OEM parts aimed at the second and third owner of the vehicle.Full disclosure, I'm an automotive lubricant product manager for ExxonMobil. OEM's are using my product range in their factory fills and I've had lengthy discussions at different levels about this but they don't care about the wrong use of \"fill for life\".\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byWattensI personally would but pretty much because of age of the oil (most DCT fluids have an acceptable shelf life of around 5 years before fallout happens, sometimes earlier if the car isn't driven much) rather than anything else.

I drive around 10,000km (6,200mi) per year and it is mostly city driving. I don't drive really hard but not like a grandpa. So I am wondering if I should get an oil change between the BMW maintenance plan of once per year. And should I also replace the rear diff fluid with the DCT fluid (every 5 years)?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMetalMKThank you for your detailed writeupI am not a fan of \"out of warranty is none of my business\" strategy by the manufacturers, but I understand why they did it.By replacing DCT fluid every 5 years, do you mean 5 years after the manufacture date or my purchase date, since my car sat in the dealership for a while before I bought it.Btw, how often do you usually change your engine oil on your M2?

So I am wondering if I should get an oil change between the BMW maintenance plan of once per year. And should I also replace the rear diff fluid with the DCT fluid (every 5 years)?1 year on DCT fluid usually won't make much difference, so no need to do it right on 5 years, it's only a guide.Diff fluid you shouldn't need to change but you can if you feel more comfortable.There is no need to change your oil earlier than the advised intervals unless you are doing a whole lot of short journeys not letting the car get up to full operating temperature to be able to evaporate off the condensation of water that forms in the engine. In reality, you can drive a lot more mileage than what the service interval says for engine oil (depending on if the right specification has been put in, the car doesn't frequent the track, a reputable brand has been used, and the vehicle doesn't do heaps of short journeys).I'd still change it at maximum every 24 months with no exception, doesn't matter what mileage it's done, even if it's been sat still for 24 months.FYI there are heavy-duty engine oils in trucks now getting over 300,000km without oil deterioration. Yes different drain capacity and driving habbit, but I bet you didn't know that until now. Most logistics lorrys in Europe can easily exceed 100,000km before even considering an engine oil change. They tend to do an oil analysis and only change when the additives or wear metals detected start to rise.\n\nWhy would you call ZF about the DCT fill? Getrag makes the DCT for BMW\n\ngreasypeanutyeah...was thinking the same... Interested to see what Getrag would say. Following this as my car is due for a \"big service\" as a service advisor told me at the dealership.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byakkandoI don't see any evidence that dct fluid needs to be done every 30k, 50k, or even 100k.Surely not! It's a fluid, which breaks down over time like any other lubricant. Let alone it contains metal cogs rotating against each other, producing micro-metallic chunks, causing increased wear. This combined with the above means all automotive fluids require scheduled replacement.Aren't the increased scheduled-durations are a result of BMW's packaged plans, where they are now paying for the maintenance on most of their cars now?",

The break in service light is just a reminder to get the break in done.  You got the oil change and it sounds like, if I'm reading right, that you will get at least four in by the time your warranty expires.

    "content": "Hi everyone,I have been experiencing an intermittent issue with my 6sp ever since new. 1st to  2nd gear grinds when shifting over 6500rpm. On a related note, this same phenomenon is only exacerbated by installing a clutch stop. I've posted about this before but basically if I run any level of clutch stop the grinding happens without fail. Naturally I removed it and for a while thought the issue was solved but I still occasionally get the grinding. Why this happens is beyond me and why others can run clutch stops without issue is also frustrating.Fast forward to a dealer visit about it. Unfortunately because it's not 100% repeatable they will not warrantee it. So it is what it is, I'm not terribly upset about it as it happens infrequently but do want to plan accordingly in the event I completely/eventually nuke 2nd gear.I know used transmissions are available for 15-2500 but would rather find someone to rebuild the trans I already have vs swapping in a used transmission with unknown history. That said, are these transmissions rebuildable? And can anyone recommend a shop that could handle it? I'm in SoCal but would ship the transmission to a specialist if need be. I would also love to chat with someone who has intimate expertise with these transmissions(if that exists) to see if they can make any recommendations about why my vehicle behaves like this.Thanks in advance\n\nGo to a different dealer, they should be fixing it for free. When I had an issue with my eccentric shaft actuator that was not repeatable I was concerned that I wouldn't be taken seriously so I ended up taking a video of the issue. Once I showed them that I was taken care of. They opened a TSARA case and asked to keep the car for a few days and gave me a loaner. Had the car back fixed under warranty within a week.\n\nI don't think another dealer would yield a different result. I am personal friends with my tech and very cool with the service writer. As of late BMW has been very aggressive about denying claims. Currently the car has a few aftermarket modifications and while everyone is in agreement they have no bearing on the issue in question they(the dealer) have been through the ringer trying to get BMW to pay out on other customer repairs involving far less with cars that had just intakes and exhausts. I'm not going to escalate this fight as the odds are currently against me and I don't want to risk getting the VIN flagged.I do plan on returning everything to stock sometime within the next year before the warranty is up in the event this problem worsens. The purpose of this post is get any info about what my possible course of action could be outside of the sphere of warranty work.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byNatekI don't think another dealer would yield a different result.

I had a Clutch stop installed and over 50K miles I developed a syncro cone problem trying to shift from 1st to 2nd gear. The car was autocrossed and tracked heavily during that time. IMHO what caused this WAS the Clutch Stop. But I also blame myself for setting it up to far off the floor.I had to eventually swap out to another used tranny.If your using a clutch stop make sure their is some room between where the clutch begins to engage and where the stop is set. I would err on the side of caution when you set it.I'm currently running a UCP which uses a stop. I've made sure its not set to close to initial pickup.\n\nCan I just check that you're starting to shift up at 6,500rpm, rather than this being the rpm at which you engage the next gear?Separately, what happens if you double de-clutch the upshifts (think Steve McQueen in Bulllit)? It sounds like the clutch isn't fully disengaging.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySEAT TIME RULESI actually had a problem on my old E36M3/4. I had a Clutch stop installed and over 50K miles I developed a syncro cone problem trying to shift from 1st to 2nd gear. The car was autocrossed and tracked heavily during that time. IMHO what caused this WAS the Clutch Stop. But I also blame myself for setting it up to far off the floor.I had to eventually swap out to another used tranny.If your using a clutch stop make sure their is some room between where the clutch begins to engage and where the stop is set. I would err on the side of caution when you set it.I'm currently running a UCP which uses a stop. I've made sure its not set to close to initial pickup.What makes you lean towards this being the clutch stop vs hard driving/shifting in autocross and track time (you mentioned 'tracked heavily').  Seems almost anecdotal again to me.  Not trying to be pedantic, I'm just trying to find real evidence that this is the cause.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byaeroglavaWhat makes you lean towards this being the clutch stop vs hard driving/shifting in autocross and track time (you mentioned 'tracked heavily').  Seems almost anecdotal again to me.  Not trying to be pedantic, I'm just trying to find real evidence that this is the cause.Because my clutch stop wasn't 100% disengaging the flywheel. By the time I noticed this I was already experiencing syncro cone damage.I had adjusted it too close to the initial contact with the flywheel.As long as your setting it up with a decent amount of room then there shouldn't be an issue.\n\nTo be clear. I don't think the clutch stop caused my issue. I think the issue was always there and the clutch stop made it more apparent",

Aside from that I read charge pipe is another but other than that most thing don't need change until 40-50k mike right?Here is a list I complied from reading online and YouTub, tell me if this is correct.- water pump failure usually 30-70k mileage- oil leak ( valve gasket, oil panel), I have no idea what and where these are- vanos solenoid - higher mileage cars usually- spark plugs and coils, really anytime?- HFPF, higher mileage usually\n\nAdd the coolant hose as well to be changed before 40-50k. They become very brittle and can burst on their own or when touched. Very common on the 2addicts forum\n\nYou have yet to do enough mileage (and the car is too new) for any of that list to be a problem.But, noting that something about the US driving environment appears to do drastic things to even fully synthetic engine oil, you may with to get it and the filter changed every 12 months / 10k miles.\n\nSpark plugs get done at your final oil change service before the maintenance plan expires.",

They're already lightweight aluminum, drilled and slotted and is an overkill for the power the original M2 is capable of. Seems like an unnecessary upgrade, unless you track your vehicle.\n\nIf it is 'Ultimate' what does it need the \"+\" ???\n\nSo they can charge you 7 bills for it, without the \"+\" it's like 5 bills...",

Redline Tranny Oil is recommended to be changed (say 30K miles)I was afraid to move away from OEM and paid big bucks for the OEM Fluid at 50K miles but then at 100K I changed to Redline (I mixed MTL with MT-90) and along with the Clutch Delay Valve delete -- I was amazed how smooth the gears shifted (BMW tech even commented how good the gears shifted).Thank for this insight. I completely forgot about Mike Miller's guide and you're correct. He does recommend redline MTL! Sounds like that's what I will try. Recently my tranny has been a bit more notchy than it used to be. I'm at roughly 20k miles\n\nHmm... unlikely to be the stock fluid breaking down, but looking forward to hearing how you get on.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyHmm... unlikely to be the stock fluid breaking down, but looking forward to hearing how you get on.I'm attributing it to gunk and flakes in the oil rather than the oil itself going bad. My hypothesis is that since the fluid wasn't changed during break in there's a lot of stuff floating around in it.For sure I know the diff has a bunch of crap in it at the 1200 mile drain and fill.

I'm wondering if a diff+transmission fluid flush would improve the gear changes, not that it's bad right now. But there are days where it's incredibly notchy/crunchy.\n\nAt the 1,200 mile service I had my friend's shop change the transmission oil as that use to be part of the M break-in service back in the day, cheap piece of mind.Used the factory oil, I figured BMW took the time to test it and certify it, they probably found it the best option/compromise to use.",

    "content": "So I just ordered my M2C and was talking to my local dealer about Spartanburg.  My question to him was if you take delivery there, how does that work since the car has the break-in period up to 1200 miles.  He responded that the car can be driven immediately on the track.  I told him from my research that wasn't the case and that the manual even says it has that break-in period.  So, for those of you that have gone there for the delivery/school, does that mean you have to drive a loaner or are you able to drive your car?  I was a little frustrated my guy doesn't seem to have that knowledge, but he's quite young and otherwise has been awesome.\n\nYou don't drive your car on the track. Imagine the liability.You drive one of their cars.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMrOhnoezYou don't drive your car on the track. Imagine the liability.You drive one of their cars.That's exactly what I thought.  Did anyone do the PC delivery though and how was the experience?\n\nI did it last April when I picked up my X5. Like others have mentioned, you don't drive your own car lol. You drive the same model you have purchased from PCD fleet.There are numerous threads on this, but you just do some \"advanced\" driving exercises, do some off-roading in a X5. And then do some \"hot laps\" on the PCD short track. All in it was a great experience and I would definitely do it for any new car I order in the future.\n\nI did it years ago. You drive the same model car that you bought, but not your own. I took my dad with me and it was a good time. You drive their short track at some speed and practice slalom, skidpad, etc. You also get a tour of the SC factory and I took a drive up some mountain roads before returning home. Downside was the highway trip home with risk for chipped front end. May be worth to PPF at least the front bumper before you drive home.\n\nI did it with my M235i a few years ago. Your cars sits pretty in an enclosed bay while you drive their car on the track. You get grouped with similar cars, so no one is way off pace in the driving exercises. My wife, who is NOT a car person, went with me and loved it (you can bring one person along as part of the deal). Plus, you have dinner, hotel, breakfast and lunch on BMW. The only downsides are that it delays delivery by a month or so, and potential rock chips on the drive home.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bySupernautI did it with my M235i a few years ago.

The PC uses them and many have gone there right after delivery at the PC before their road trip home.Here's the link to their site page about the PC, so check them out.  I've not used them for anything (yet), but I've heard great things about them.Oh, and PC delivery is a blast - not to be missed.  It's been 18 years since I did my first trip there for my E39.  The people are fantastic. They do not have 6MT versions of any car (except back in the old days when the E39 M5 only came with a 6MT), so you'll drive a DCT version of the M2C from their PC fleet of cars.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byaeroglavaQuote:Originally Posted byBigKuttaI've kept rpm under 5000 and under 90 mph, and trust me when I say this is the most fun I've ever head.

They now only have DCT/Auto versions of all cars, so if you're picking up a manual M2C, you'll have the session in a DCT example.\n\nAlso you get to drive the X5s on the off-road course in addition to the like model of what vehicle you purchased.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJCZ5Also you get to drive the X5s on the off-road course in addition to the like model of what vehicle you purchased.That part was kinda fun.

The service oil message is totally expected under your circumstanceIf you look at your BMW Connect application, it will show a month and year as well as mileage when an oil change is due.  The earliest event sets off the service light.  You M2 is asking for a low mileage oil change due to time.The same information is briefly displayed each time you start your BMW in the instrument cluster.\n\nI had similar questions after my first break in service.  I recall being told that per BMW service protocol the indicators are NOT reset after that first service. Indicators were reset at dealership for the two subsequent oil changes I have had since then..\n\nLike others said the interval is 10k miles or 1 year which ever comes first. But the service is also condition-based based on how you drive.I only drive about 8-9k miles a year in my F31 over the last 6 years I have owned it now and the CBS interval indicator usually comes on at 8k miles so. About half the miles in a year are fairly short trips and the the other half are long road trips. On a 2k mile road trip that is mostly the indicator won't lose any miles but a month of short trips where I drive only 700 miles the indicator might drop 1.5k miles.We will see how the wife's M2 does, we have only had it for 2k miles now.\n\nI have been told that it depends on your driving style (hard every day or just when in track or trip and easy on a daily basis)",

Hard to do with 788M wheels though...\n\nThe pad wear sensors only indicate once the pads are worn down to a certain thickness (because it means the pad sensor actually also becomes physically into contact with the brake rotor/disc), at this point the system will give you an estimate until the pads will wear out entirely. I don't know exactly how the system will estimate wear until that sensor first starts reading, or whether it actually uses the number of km/miles between the sensor being reset (and physically replaced) and first contact to then extrapolate the remaining life or if it uses a fix km/mile range for telling you when the pads need replacing.I personally would not place much faith in the miles/km reading that the iDrive tells you for remaining pad thickness, only once it starts actually warning you that front and/or rear pads need replacing would I then be concerned about really checking how much life is left and booking an appointment to replace soon. Having said that, I track my car and so my pad wear sensors are never actually in the pads so they won't trigger for me but I am physically checking pad thickness before and after every event and before the season starts so I don't rely on the sensors.",

You also get:- 1x MOT (which won't be until Dec 2022)- Wash & vac per visit (no thanks, nobody washes my car apart from me)- Fluid top up each service (er, the S1 service is a fluid change, and the S2 is a major service including oils?!?)- Seasonal healthcheck (maybe useful for Granny Smith or somebody not at all interested in maintaining a car)- Map updates (I think I have this included in one of my \"pack\" subscriptions anyway)....So, I need to investigate the off-the-street cost of an S1 and S2 service, but to me, it looks an utter waste of time?

I know their head tech, Colin, so I'll see if I can glean more info if I can bump into him.It must be documented somewhere (I'm going to start trawling that treasure trove of M2C info that's in one of these sub-forums - maybe service info is in there?)ETA - when making my booking last week, they offered me the Service Pack subscription.....£1,260 up front or £35/mth x 35 payments and it covers S1 service @ 15k miles (oil and microfilter) and S2 major service at 30k miles. You also get:- 1x MOT (which won't be until Dec 2022)- Wash & vac per visit (no thanks, nobody washes my car apart from me)- Fluid top up each service (er, the S1 service is a fluid change, and the S2 is a major service including oils?!?)- Seasonal healthcheck (maybe useful for Granny Smith or somebody not at all interested in maintaining a car)- Map updates (I think I have this included in one of my \"pack\" subscriptions anyway)....So, I need to investigate the off-the-street cost of an S1 and S2 service, but to me, it looks an utter waste of time? Anyone else using it? I thought initially it may include the running in service (£355+VAT) but nope....the service pack doesn't seem a good idea in my opinionI've been quoted 350£ vat included for RIS",

Your 5W-40 is good enough for the kind of weather you are having, so there is no need to change the oil just for cold temperature protection. With that being said, if you car already needs an oil change, you can try some 0W oil, but it is not necessary.\n\nMaybe I'm getting into the weeds a bit to much. Yes 5w40 is able to work down to -30° but I started looking into more detailsThe stuff I was planning on using, Motul 8100 X-cess 5W-40 looks like a great oil but viscosity at 40°C us is 86.2 & it's pour point is -36°C. From what I've seen, a lot of 0W-30 oils like the recommended BMW LL-01 FE 0W-30 are 70 vis & -50ish pour point.I've been searching around and found Liqui Moly Top Tec 4200 5W-30 that is rated LL-01 FE with a viscosity of 70 & Pour of -42 °C while still retaining a relatively high viscosity at 100°C of 12.2 vs the Motul 14.2 or roughly 12 of the BMW stuff.

    "content": "I picked up my 2020 M2C a few weeks ago and am painfully making me way through the break-in period. I've been monitoring the oil temp gauge and have had trouble getting to \"ideal\" temperature in the middle of the range. For me, the range starts at 160F, and the middle is 250F. This seems high based on what I'm reading on here. I live in San Francisco (so usually 60 degree weather recently), and after going for drives for 1hr+, I still can only get to around 200-210F.So, I was wondering: (1) how do you guys usually get your car to temperature quickly, and (2) what temperature should I really wait for before pushing the car (after the break-in, of course)?\n\nIf you use sport plus mode for engine/throttle you activate the additional cooling and the temperature will not exceed 200F, use efficiency or sport mode to get the engine to temperature quickly and you will see 230/240FAt 200F the oil is hot enough to push the car to high revs.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by_RS4_If you use sport plus mode for engine/throttle you activate the additional cooling and the temperature will not exceed 200F, use efficiency or sport mode to get the engine to temperature quickly and you will see 230/240FAt 200F the oil is hot enough to push the car to high revs.Correct!I have the electronic steering wheel which allows me to monitor the exact temperature by degrees. Once it hits the 200F* threshold you're good to go, but it will take longer to get there if you're in Sport+. This usually takes about 10-12 minutes to reach in Comfort....\n\n^^^ what they said ^^^\n\nSo it's only Sport+ and not just Sport that has the increased cooling? I have been running on efficient until the car has warmed up then switching to Sport. Haven't really used Sport+ yet.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byVulpeSo it's only Sport+ and not just Sport that has the increased cooling? I have been running on efficient until the car has warmed up then switching to Sport.

Using a logging tool you can watch the oil temps drop in real time when switching to Sport, Sport +, or DSC off. Traction and comfort will allow it to get a bit hotter.On the OG M2 if you push the car hard in any of the sport modes you can still get it up over the 200* mark pretty easily.\n\nGood Info here:  OLD BUT STILL EXCELLENT & REF HIGH BMW TEMPS\n\nI have noticed  that the M2C runs cooler than my previous M2.",

My E46 m3 with SMG transmission used to sound like this, but I only have 6,000 miles on this M2.Curious to hear if anyone else has these issues?Yes on the clunk! But slightly different circumstances.Don't know about the creak but my M2 (MY16 6spd MT) also has a slight clunk from the drive train. Had it since day 1. Sounds like it comes more from the rear than the tranny but I cant be sure.tough to duplicate because of the rev match. Usually feel/hear it when I upshift slowly below 2K rpm. In other words in slower traffic. Haven't really noticed it coming off the throttle, more so when delaying the gear change, keep clutch depressed, so the rev match idle drops back down and the drivetrain \"loads\" when you reengage coming off the clutch.Could be tranny or diff mount bushing? drive shaft play? That what it feels like to me. I have a similar clunk in my E36 M3.Car hasn't made it to the 1200 service yet. Not sure how I will handle this at the service. I suspect they will beat on the car to get the clunk sound. Never happens when I am on the throttle. Most pronounced when driving the car like a Prius!Since I am confirmed to get a new diff at some point I thought I would see if it persisted after the diff was replaced. That should rule out diff bushing and mount issues.This is NOT the \"sodacan\" sound everyone is talking about. I have had that too!\n\nTurns out it was the strut boot.

Read this thread (I'm the thread creator and posted a video):http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1291083\n\nAny updates on anyone's clunking?  Mine is still the same, haven't yet taken to dealer. But really annoying.  Example, I'll be in 5th around 3000-3200 RPM and completely let off the throttle, not abruptly, (slowing traffic in front of me) then when I re-engage throttle instants later, huge annoying clunk coming from the rear of the car. As if some slack has formed while letting go of the throttle.I cannot ignore it. I've learned to drive differently to avoid it, but certainly cannot be normal. The clunk/knock is way too strong to be normal. Something's gonna give eventually. It's either driving shaft or diff related in my opinion.  If I were tracking my car right now that ON/OFF on the throttle would exacerbate this issue.Can't believe how few people have noticed this...\n\nThanks for bringing this up. The same with my car and 6MT.Even in no magazine or video test I noticed a comment on that. And I think it's quite significantly recognizable and relevant to the driving experience - much more than the angled drivers seat or the missing oil temp gauge.\n\nShort update on the clunk noise and feel in my 6MT M2 from 1/2017:I had the car at the local BMW dealer yesterday and we drove quite a while. The BMW Head of Service was in the car and he confirmed the signifikant clunk comming fom the diff area.When I leave the throttle in gears 4,5,6 with rpm approx. 2800-3400 there is a strong clunk noise and feel from underneath the car as somebody hits the floor with a rubber hammer. It is really anoying and I can't ignore it. It doesn't matter if the car gets pulled a bit harder or if I drive like a granny. BUT it's much more signifikant in the two modes sport and sport+ than in comfort mode. Comfort mode doesn't show this effect so extremly. Maybe 20% of it.Finally, the BMW guys determined that this can not be normal and have put the car on the ramp to check the diff and the fixings. The first impressions showed no obvious reasons for the play in the drivetrain.My car has 1300 km and we agreed, that they do some research until the break in service in 700 km....I hope they find a solution. As mentioned, I can't accept that play in the drive train and I'm sure that this is not normal!I would be very happy if someone with the same problem has additional input or even a solution for that.\n\nHave had similar clunks like that in all the manual transmissions cars Ive owned. E30, E36, Mustang GT, even felt it in my buddies vette. Maybe not as severe as you guys make it sound, but to some extent.https://www.edmunds.com/ford/mustang...unk-sound.html\n\nDo you have it in your M2 with manual transmission, too and is it worse than with the other cars?My other bimmers including the Z3 M Coupé are free of clunking so far. Even my old e36 M3 3.2 with 200.00 km had only very little clunking.The new M2 is REALLY anoying regarding that. I never felt that in any other car\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZ3MQPShort update on the clunk noise and feel in my 6MT M2 from 1/2017:I had the car at the local BMW dealer yesterday and we drove quite a while.

I wish I was close to other 6MT owners to compare. But the fact that your dealership admits it isn't normal is great news.Thank you for sharing. Keep us posted!\n\nShort update:I brought my car to the local BMW Dealer today and gave them a detailed list of the symptoms.Unfortunately my car has another problem: There are two different clacking noises from the rear... One is metallic, the other sounds more like a heavy plastic part romping in the trunk.I hope they are able to eliminate these flaws. I love that car but I can´t live with these noises and the strong play in the drive train...\n\nI got my car back today. They haven't found the reason yet.. Munich told them to do a video and send it to them.Now I have to wait until they come back with instructions from Munich...Any news from you and your cars?\n\nIf it's any help, my M235 6MT exhibits some mild differential \"bumping\" or slack when letting off the throttle, typically at 60-65mph in 6th.  It can occur in other situations, but that's the most noticeable situation.  I've noticed this issue in many other RWD and AWD cars. Some worse than others.  I haven't bothered having BMW look into it because I'm certain it's normal and nothing can be done with OEM parts.  I'm sure you can quell the issue with much stiffer bushings, etc. but then you'll create a whole slew of other NVH issues.My guess is the sound/sensation in the M2 could be more prevalent because the M2 runs much stiffer rear subframe bushings.  I believe they're straight metal and not rubber filled like on the M235.  That will certainly increase NVH and is the price you pay for running racecar-like parts on the street.  It's a compromise.\n\nThank you for your InputWhat you describe I recognize in some of my other BMW, too. But there it is MUCH more gentle and smooth than in the M2. I wouldn´t complain about some noises and mechanic feedback like that because it´s a sports car.In the M2 it really feels like a strong mechanic play as if the diff hits something realtivly strong. And it is with a delay of nearly a second from the moment I leave the throttle...I think it gets even worth with the time and it even doesn´t feel save... It feels if something could be destroyed after a while.Fortunately the local BMW Team judges it the same way.And if that would be normal, all magazines would have sucked at the M2 justifiably for sure.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZ3MQPThank you for your InputWhat you describe I recognize in some of my other BMW, too.

We drove quite a while and had the play with the delay in drivetrain all the time. The reason they have sent him is, that the local BMW Service leader also said that this is not normal and that it is really anoying!So finally when we drove with my M2, I assume the guy from munich sliped in his poker face mask and tried to understate the problem... He suggested to do the 2000km service and see how it behaves afterwards. In parallel will take this problem to munich and discuss it with the local engineers.After picking my car up today and driving the car \"hard\" for the first time, I have to say the problem is still there!!I repeat myself, I can't accpet that flaw.

This worked fine on my M135i.Has anyone else done this maintenance to their M2 yet?\n\nYeah, I had mine done when I had a Turbosmart Electronic Diverter Valve installed a few months ago as it is near impossible to do without moving the coolant pipes out of the way.The place I used just used the BMW Coolant (which is the exact same product as Gysantin G48 silicated hybrid).From what I remember seeing, they removed the bottom bash plate and dropped what looked like a front sway bar and they could access the water pump/coolant pipe from there.It wasn't a hard job but seemed easy because it was on a lift.Mine is an April 16 build. There were no signs of corrosion. I personally wouldn't have changed it until after 5 years, but as it had to get drained to reach the diverter valve, what's the harm in replacing it?Do remember that a \"factory fill for life\" for most OEM's is around 7-10 years. It doesn't actually mean \"filled for the whole life of the vehicle' which is quite misleading and confusing.I'm not sure how much coolant they used.Full disclosure I do this for a living, meaning I'm a product manager for Oil and Chemicals companies, so I have a better idea than most forum users and I've managed BASF/Gysantin, Halterman Carless etc... in the UK, Europe, and Australia.Also, I highly recommend upgrading the diverter valve with the Turbosmart Kompact EM product, the stock plastic diverter valve leaks boost. Don't waste your time with the GFB DV+, I tried that first because it was cheaper and it destroyed my OEM diverter valve, the Turbosmart one replaces the OEM diverter valve so when it comes time to sell, put the OEM one back on and use the Turbosmart one for the next car.Hope this helps\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byWattensYeah, I had mine done when I had a Turbosmart Electronic Diverter Valve installed a few months ago as it is near impossible to do without moving the coolant pipes out of the way.The place I used just used the BMW Coolant (which is the exact same product as Gysantin G48 silicated hybrid).From what I remember seeing, they removed the bottom bash plate and dropped what looked like a front sway bar and they could access the water pump/coolant pipe from there.It wasn't a hard job but seemed easy because it was on a lift.Mine is an April 16 build.

My understanding of the process was pretty much as youve described. Having access to a lift would make it much easier. When I did the coolant change on my last N55 it was on low profile ramps in my garage and access was tight but just doable. The M2 is lower and access for removing the belly plate is really tight so I think I need some new ramps.Other than that though it should be pretty straight forward.As you say, changing coolant at 3 years is on the early side so Im in no rush but will definitely get it done in the next twelve months. I enjoy wrenching on my cars and Ive found BMWs easy to maintain for the home diyer.On Glysantins website they state 3-4 years life, so less than 7-10 although it will probably be safe a little longer than their recommendation before it becomes too acidic.Thanks for the heads up on the diverted valve too, sounds worth looking in to!\n\nWell, in the same way that BMW claim the coolant is a 'lifetime' fill, so the manufacturer of said coolant will claim it needs changing every time you drive the car.In the meantime: Has it changed colour? Does it still feel oily?I also run a 2002 E46 330ci. According to the paperwork the coolant had never been changed when I bought it at 150k/11 years. The radiator was junk and there were some signs of electrolytic corrosion.Early is better, but not necessary. Late is always bad. May I suggest that there is a frequency distribution that BMW uses for its warrantee claims, and that under whatever is a standard length of financial deal where you are, the 'lifetime' fill doesn't result in them losing money.So. Check it regularly, and change it if it shows signs of breaking down. in the meantime, noting that its cheap to do, try not to worry.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyWell, in the same way that BMW claim the coolant is a 'lifetime' fill, so the manufacturer of said coolant will claim it needs changing every time you drive the car.In the meantime: Has it changed colour?

Besides the failure has the DV+ performed as well as the Turbosmart?Don't do what I did and get the DV+ because it was cheaper. It's just a headache and a shitty product.I mean the Turbosmart and the GFB items operated the same (while the GFB DV+ was working) as there's not much to it, they are both operated by the car ECU and both make a better seal than the OEM.As the diverter valve requires quite a lot of removing the bash plate cover, a front sway bar and removing a coolant pipe from the water pump resulting in a full coolant flush, ideally a car lift, you'd want the better lasting product in it the first time so you aren't throwing money down the drain trying to access the diverter valve to repair/replace it.Once you have access to the diverter valve, the major difference is the Turbosmart product used 3 bolts that fit into the turbo perfectly, and it came with the right plug that connects to the BMW wiring.The DV+ is a similar procedure, except you then pull apart the plastic OEM diverter valve, modify it, then put it back on to the turbo.Even if the DV+ part doesn't fail, the plastic OEM diverter valve is still just that, plastic and WILL eventually fail again.My advice is just to get the Turbosmart product installed from the beginning and have the OEM diverter valve sitting in the garage as a spare until it's time to put the car back to stock to sell the car. And then sell the Turbosmart product or take it with you on to your next car.The Turbosmart product is made of billet aluminum. It even just feels like a well-enginered part.\n\nHopefully everyone removing the chassis reinforcement (it really, really isn't a 'bash plate'...) thought to renew the strechbolts that hold it in place, and didn't do anything that would apply torsion to the front end while it was off...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyHopefully everyone removing the chassis reinforcement (it really, really isn't a 'bash plate'...) thought to renew the strechbolts that hold it in place, and didn't do anything that would apply torsion to the front end while it was off...Correct, its a stiffening plate and the car needs to be raised evenly on both sides when removing so as not to upset geometry. Ive got new bolts ready to install. I plan to drive the car into ramps to gain access.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byWattensDon't do what I did and get the DV+ because it was cheaper.

There are several videos and forum posts that show this is not necessary. It is necessary to remove the stiffening plate, and though not necessary, unbolting the water pump but not disconnecting any pipes helps with access.The DV+ itself re-uses the solenoid portion of the factory diverter valve, which itself has no moving parts. Everything else, including all moving parts, are replaced with machined metal parts. Three replacement screws are supplied and they too fit into the turbo perfectly. It also has the same plug because the solenoid is factory... therefore it just plugs in.I don't want to suggest that fitting the DV+ is easy; it's a royal pain, but that's not the fault of the product, and I wonder if your mechanic did something wrong when installing the DV+ which caused it to fail.The Turbosmart option is probably great, and since I've not seen it or installed it myself I'm not qualified to comment, but I feel that you're unfairly bashing the DV+ product... no-one else seems to have had anything but praise for it... myself included.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byNezilI don't want to start and argument, but I think what you're saying is a little unfair...To start with, your complaint with the GFB DV+ is the first I've heard of, and similarly this is also the first time I've heard of the Turbosmart alternative.You suggest that to replace the diverter valve requires \"[removing the] front sway bar and removing a coolant pipe from the water pump resulting in a full coolant flush\", but this is simply untrue.

But your whole reply is just bashing my first-hand experience...I couldn't care less if you had a good experience with DV+, I didn't and I only brought it up as someone wanted to know more about it. So I gave them my experience.How long did it take you to change your DV?Because my mechanic did it in 30 minutes from hoist up to hoist down, by dropping things to make it easier to access. The time he saved on labor went into new coolant. I'd rather pay for new coolant in my car than wasted labor costs...Also in my first post, I believe I said: \"it isnearimpossible to do without moving the coolant pipes out of the way.\" I'm well aware you don't have to remove the water pump and sway, but it makes it next level easier if you do.This guy in the link below took 8 hours to get the OEM DV off on his 235i and still complained that he couldn't see a lot of what he was doing and was doing things by feel. If only he made his life easier by dropping the coolant...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4NvxLuLILgMy car's still running the OEM plastic charge pipes, so by your logic the others out there that have failed did something wrong?You don't even know how it failed and why it's made my OEM part useless, yet you're telling me the product is fine...You're not a DV+ reseller by any chance?Wow this is the last time I reply to someones innocent question about DV+\n\nI'm reading this as a DIY guy and I run into the drama every forum has.

They then went on to reassure me that it was covered by the warrantee, they had already ordered the parts for delivery the following day, so would pull the gearbox 1st thing and inspect it .

As such, a stop sale has been issued for all of these cars, and a recall will be issued for cars that have already been sold. Production is stopped until a solution can be implemented. There is currently not a fix available as the problem has not been completely identified. More information will be available Thursday.My situation is somewhat unique in that I've already paid for and registered my car and have tags and plates. BMW still told me that I cannot pickup my car and will be contacted by customer relations.

I can tell you its normal and nothing to worry about.Response: Agree with others. BMWs have a lot of tech in them. Merely press the door lock unlock button and it starts a system of clicks and whirs and pumps going. I'm pretty sure at least one of them is a priming pump or lift pump for the fuel system.\n\nYup engine off. I dont know why it did that but dealership told me they replaced vanos motor and no more clicking after that. So it looks like you are set to what you believe in.

There's always the \"it's normal\" response as well.Of course, the ticking didn't happen while there and I got the \"no codes\" response.The final straw was  that my tailight was failing and letting in moisture.

They took the car but couldn't replicate it. Happily though, instead of brushing me off they asked for a copy of the video and diligently forward it to BMW. Was told that they would be replacing the eccentric shaft servo motor but I will have to wait till I pick up the car to share the part numbers of what was and what wasn't replaced.

I can replicate the sound when making a right hand turn over a bump or if entering a driveway that has a slight incline, where the chassis has to flex. Sound can also be heard if I hit a manhole cover with the driver's side. It's not intrusive, but it is annoying, considering it sounds like it comes from the window seal area which is directly next to my ear. Upon inspection, everything seems tight as a drum, so I'm wondering if chassis flex is to blame?Car has 2500 miles on it.\n\nOn mine its the windows making noise on the seals even when new.  Once I tinted the windows most of the creaking went away.\n\nInteresting. I'm getting tint done in the next few weeks, I will update if anything changes.

Not related to MAF sensor, except it happens to be same size. Funny enough, I nicked my MAF sensor o-ring as well, when I did my charge pipe upgrade; I left it as is.

Since then I haven't seen the warning light again.It appeared right above the digital time on the bottom right of the dash on the digital screen portion.From what I recall the symbol was of 2 \"cars\" side by side. The left car was flat \"facing\" you, and the right car was on its side \"tipped over\" facing you.My guess would be a warning light if you crashed and tipped your car but I can't find anything online that looks remotely close to what I saw.Any ideas?\n\nsounds like a accident ahead icon from the GPS?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bytenkiessounds like a accident ahead icon from the GPS?You are 100% correct. In retrospect after you mention it, I vividly remember seeing the notification on the main screen, but was confused by the icon on my dashboard.Thanks for clearing this up for me.\n\nFor reference, the indicator OP is talking about looks like the attached file. It can appear on your map or dashboard depending on your current route and the severity of the incident.",

    "title": "How to get M2 onto jack stands?",
    "content": "I'm looking to buy a jack and jack stands so that I can do some routine maintenance, such as oil changes and brakes, on my 2018 M2.I can not seem to find a low profile jack that has a long enough chassis to reach the front center lift point shown in another post I found on this forum (e.g.https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1306220), that would allow me to put jack stands under the lifting points along the side rockers. I have measured from the front lip of the bumper to that front center lift point and it measures almost 38 inches, but the longest jack chassis I can find is the Arcan XL2T Black Low Profile Steel Service Jack which only has a 32 inch chassis (e.g.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007G83T16..._t5_B00FN9F69I). Another thread in this forum had a link to a Compac model jack listed at $625 that might work (http://www.reverselogic.us/jacks---l...tegory=6233010), but there is no way I'm paying that much for a car jack...Can any of you guys give me some tips on how to get this car up off the ground and onto some jack stands without shelling out ridiculous cash for QuickJacks?Brian L2018 MG M2 - Dinan STG1, Fabspeed DP, Wagner EVO Comp II FMIC\n\nOk here are a few methods to get your car on jack stands that I can think of if you dont have a super low profile jack, a lift, or quick jacks. Just be cautious as this can be risky and I will not be responsible for any bad out comes.1) Jack the car up on the side jacking points like usual and put a few blocks of wood under the front tires or bricks, something sturdy and strong. Then the car will be high enough at the front for the jack to reach the center jack point. Do the same for the rear then you can use a circle or square pad jack to put a jack pad adapter on it and then place it under the jacking point. After that use the front center jacking point to lower the car onto the jack stands. For the rear use the control arm/subframe link spot (cant think of the word but here is the thread that shows ithttps://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1036675)2) Jack the car up using the jack points, and instead of using jack stands place the car onto a ramp which are pretty cheap at local auto parts stores like canadian tire, autozone, auto value, princess auto etc. (Most of these places are canadian so go to a parts store local to you if these arent available.)3) This may not be optimal but there are shops where you can rent a bay for cheap if the above options are not feasible.I hope I was able to help out!\n\nNot sure if this will help you but I do it with two jacks - one small and one large.I have a low profile jack (short like you mentioned) and another low profile jack that is long and rated for 3000kg - but it is not low enough on its own to reach the centre jack point in the front.I use the smaller jack on the front side to lift the front, enough to slide my larger jack under to the centre point. Once I get that under, I jack it up and put in the jack stands on the front two points. I then use large jack on the rear differential bar to lift up the rear, and put the next two jack stands on.\n\nIs driving the front wheels on a couple 2x6s or 2x8s enough clearance to get a non-low-profile jack under the car?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2guruIs driving the front wheels on a couple 2x6s or 2x8s enough clearance to get a non-low-profile jack under the car?Maybe, but it depends on how thick your jack is. Best way to figure it out is measure the height of your jack, and the height of the m2 + the thickness of the wood in this case 2\".\n\nFor oil changes or down pipe changes, I just jack each side up and put a ramp under each front wheel.  Nice and stable.I have also drove onto a couple 2x6s under the fronts, then jack from Center jack point and carefully lowered onto stands that were on the side points (which is a terribly unstable process as my jack releases quite fast).  I dont do this anymore.Wheel swaps I just jack one side at a time and do it while car is on the jack.  The jack lifts the whole side of car, so both wheels at the same time.  I swap one wheel at a time.  I break the torque of the lugs first before lifting.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDrop the hammerFor oil changes or down pipe changes, I just jack each side up and put a ramp under each front wheel.

Stable as any other jack stands.One of the biggest benefits over quickjacks is that these are portable and come handy to the track.Ah I see.What I meant is if the pins are tight and not loose, so when the car is moving slightly from you working on it, it won't eventually work itself out.How high did it go again? I look at a YouTube video and it didn't look high enough to crawl under. Maybe it was because the guy didn't out it high enough.I couldn't use this on my track because the pits are either grass or gravel and the parking lot is too far from the main track. That's also why quick Jack's are great especially if you have a support truck. (For use on gravel of course because they'd be more stable, grass is pretty much useless for jacking up the car)\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMR_M2I bought safe jacks:You can jack and use jack stands under the same jack point.Not sure how you got these under your car to fit.

Supports 3 tons.\n\nI have the arcan jack and 4 esco stands. I use another jack on one of the side jacking points to get the front high enough so i can get the arcan jack far enough under the car to hit that front point without damaging my bumper. I reverse the process on the way back down.Getting the back up with the arcan jack is a bit tricky, I've learned to rotate that plate on the saddle around so that the subframe sits in the valley between the raised portions. It's a tight fit as the diff and exhaust are right there.To be honest with you, I really wish I had just put the funds towards a quickjack - the jack and stands probably got me near halfway there $$-wise, half my time swapping wheels is devoted to getting this car in the air, and even then I've never felt super safe with the rear center jacking point (you can see my post in that first thread you linked to).\n\n2nd cheap jack is really the easiest solution.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymr_lab_rat2nd cheap jack is really the easiest solution.But then how do you put it on jack stands from there? As you know working on hydraulic Jack's isn't safe.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF87sourceBut then how do you put it on jack stands from there? As you know working on hydraulic Jack's isn't safe.You use 2 jacks to get it onto the jack stands. You start with one low-profile jack at one of the jacking points, lift the car so you can get a second jack to one of the center lift points, then raise the car from the center lift point. Once raised with the center lift point, you remove the jack from the jack point and place 2 jack stands under the front left & right points or rear left & right points (depending on which center lift point you're on).I got myself a QuickJack so that's my approach now. In the past, I lifted the car at the side lift points and then just put a jack jack stand under suspension components and lowered. That's not really ideal since it probably won't be as stable and choosing the right suspension part to use for jacking can be a challenge.\n\nI watched some BMW techs swapping wheels from side to side at Brands Hatch last summer. They put the big trolley jack under the rear point and lifted until there was clearance to but an axle stand under the front point. Then did the same on the other side.",

Lot of opinions about it on both sides.  I have done both depending on the car.  For whatever it's worth (not much) I have just driven fairly moderately during break-in on any of my new M cars - staying within BMW's recommendations & haven't had any issues with oil burning.  Also keep in mind the engine isn't the only thing being broken in.\n\nMy break-in procedure is to drive through mountain passes. Up through the gears then down through the gears. That way you get acceleration and deceleration using the engine. Personally I wouldn't be doing any redlining.\n\nLots of old wives tales in here.

What do I do?You go in for your free oil change and car wash. That's what I do.\n\nFirst scheduled oil change is one year after manufacture.  Your car is telling you July or 7,500 miles which ever comes first.  Take it in for a free oil change.\n\nFree? Well, this isn't irritating in any way for those of us who have to pay for servicing...\n\nI would inquire as there is usually a window in which you can capitalize on the free service. When I took delivery of my f-type I didn't realize the dealership somehow initiated the maintenance from when they took delivery of the vehicle and not when I took delivery 6mo later.  When I took the car in they said I was outside the window.  They still took care of me, but next service occurred 6mo later to get things back in sync.  Crazy part is that the service interval for the svr motor is  one year or 16k miles. Blows my mind to go that long on a performance motor.\n\n2017+ BMWs came with 3yr/36,000 free maintenance. Older BMWs are 4yr/50,000mi So I don't understand how you guys aren't getting free maintenance since no M2 has broke this mark yet. Unless you bought used and it wasn't transferred??For the OP, I have no idea why is service indicator is asking for an oil change 3 months after he had it changed. The oil service is supposed to be once a year, or every XXX miles that the car calculates based on driving condition,. Usually in the 7000-10000 mile range, I believe.Service starts the day you take ownership of the vehicle, and the computer synced itself the day you did the break-in service and it was reset.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAnthony1s2017+ BMWs came with 3yr/36,000 free maintenance.

They haven't even mentioned that its only oil replacement.It'll take me a while to get to 9000 KMs but I'll report back after I'll get there.\n\nJust got this notification now. At first, my heart stopped beating as I though it is the car that is low on oil but then I read the message carefully and remembered this thread. Is that the oil replacement a few of you were talking about? Why can't I get rid of this message? It'll take me a while to complete these 2000 KMs:\n\nThe sooner the car is serviced the more free services you'll get before the free maintenance expires.

My old Sienna required a special tool also.  RS6 is a bit of pain in the a&& due to the clearance on the front antiroll bar (have to drop it) and the filter only comes out by tipping it open end down!  MESSY!My '97 M3 was a DREAM.  Filter on top and oil drain plug within about 12 inches of the front line of the car! No ramps needed, just reach under.So what about the M2?  New 2016 nightmare setup?Mike\n\nI know on the N55 in my E90 it's a piece of cake, hopefully it's the exact same for the M2, although I haven't had to do mine yet.What oil are you going to use, and why?\n\nWhatever oil BMW recommends!

No ramps needed, just reach under.MikeProps to you...even with my low-profile pan I couldn't change on my E36 without ramps.I still have a box of leftover oil filters from my 135is. Hopefully they're the same on the M2.\n\nInteresting question, I'd like to know as well.  Once someone gets under their M2 let us know!  It's not like you have to change the oil to find out, right..? lol\n\nAre any cars already outside of 40k miles?\n\nThere is nothing special about changing the oil in the M2.  You can do it in 15 minutes start to finish.\n\ni changed mine about a month ago.  to remove the oil filter you need a special socket, which i bought from turner motorsport.  i used mann oil filter, which is available at advanced auto.  if i remember correctly, the mann's oil filter came with two seals and a drain plug washer, so make sure you use those.i jacked up the car from the front center jacking point and rear diff and put it on floor jacks at the four corners.  i used a low profile longnose floor jack for the front.i changed the oil right around 5k miles because i don't buy the 10k interval bs.  i didn't reset anything after the oil change.  the whole process, from jacking up the car to dropping it down, took about 40 min.  i'm sure it can be shorter, but that was my first oil change on a new bmw, so i took my time.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCosmosMpowerAre any cars already outside of 40k miles?What does 40k have to do with it.

Even if they charge more to the customer for the M2 filter it's probably offset in the long run by overhead costs.

I would think you would get a better drain out with the car being parallel to the floor.\n\nI haven't had the dealer change my oil, but I've changed it myself 3 times already.  Motul.

    "title": "Moonroof closing",
    "content": "I noticed something weird:Say I open the moon-roof by tilting it up at the back.When I turn off the engine, the moon-roof automatically closes half way. It doesn't close completely, only half of the original opening.Initially, I thought that was a feature. If you park under the sun, you'd still want it partially open to alleviate the heat build up inside, but you don't want it completely open so to protect partially against dust and a potential rain.When I get back in and turn on the engine, the moon-roof doesn't return to the original open position. However, if I turn off the engine, again it automatically closes half.Eventually, it's practically closed. Not completely, but pretty much useless for air ventilation.Anyone observe that symptom? Or is it a defect in my car?\n\nAre you activating the automatic close function while locking the car? BMWs will automatically close windows and the sun roof if you hold the lock button on the remote (or keep pinching the comfort access). If you push the button very briefly then it shouldn't close anything.With coding you can also adjust how long you have to hold/pinch before things automatically close or adjust which features work (i.e. just windows, include roof and door mirrors).There is also the opposite feature for unlocking, holding the unlock button or comfort access will start opening windows and roof. This can be particularly handy on super hot days where your car will have baked in the sun for a bit, then you can let it vent a little before you get in.\n\nThanks. That's exactly what was happening.I figured it out:When I (normal) touch the door handle, the moonroof auto closes and mirrors fold.Somehow the moonroof stops before it completely closes. Maybe the system shuts down power before it can complete. But the mirrors fold fine.When I touch very briefly, door locks, but nothing closes or folds.",

    "title": "Early run-in service normal?",
    "content": "So I took my brand new M2 Competition in to fix few little things and I thought also to have an early oil change, ~250 miles on the clock, to clean the tolerances collected in the block. The dealership initially declined my request saying that they don't do it outside or the running in scheduled period but then it turns out my car is due servicing by July hence they will do it.Now my question is, how is it possible the car needs servicing so early and why do they do it so early when the runbook clearly says at 1200 miles? Ideas? Shall I get worried or it's all good and I will still need to stick to run-in procedure?Thanks in advance for your help\n\nThe first 2 service countdowns the car will do is break-in service at 1200 miles and 1st oil change at 10k miles OR 1 year from manufacture date. These 2 run concurrently and one does not affect the other.  If you have a service due in iDrive it's likely the yearly and likely because your car was manufactured in june or July of 2018 (you can check the VIN herehttps://decoder.bvzine.com/)\n\nHi there, not really, first order placed in October 2018 if I'm not mistaken, cancelled by December 2018, new order automatically placed in January 2019 manufactured in February 2019, car collected in March.This is the 1st service, running in, service. Let's even assume for a moment the car was manufactured in July 2018, my probably misinformed engineering background can't compute how the running in service could possibly be a timed one. The running in service is meant to remove all the crap and the tolerances from the moving parts hence my concern.\n\nDoes it actually say it needs service now or it needs service in X miles? maybe a picture of what the iDrive is tell you would help. mine technically says I need service (when I start it), but it also says that service is needed in 8000 miles\n\nI can't recall properly now, but the BMW system, the one the representative had on screen, said it is due in July... I took the car willing in because I wanted to preventively change the oil anyway to remove the big part of the tolerances and then continue the run-in with peace of mind, they initially refused and then they said, oh but the diagnostic says it's due in July we will do it.Moreover, now, to add insult to the injury they busted the head unit with a software update... I'm so not pleased with it.\n\nSo, just a quick update, I collected my car today and I spoke with the head engineer in the workshop and spoke with him about the situation.Despite on the forum it was debunked that there are no special fluids in the car, I was told instead that was the case and that for that reason the running in service is also timed and that the internal sensors in the car detected that the factory oil deteriorated and needed replacement despite the low mileage. With that said he also told me that at this point, because I have proper oils in the car I can now be a bit more spirited with my driving and I can also take the car on the highway without worrying... I'm still a bit skeptical to be honest but one side of me want also this to be true.\n\nHe told you what he thought you wanted to hear, based on your previous interest \"to clean the tolerances collected in the block\"HTH.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyHe told you what he thought you wanted to hear, based on your previous interest \"to clean the tolerances collected in the block\"HTH.Well not exactly, that guy didn't know about my car at all or why it was there apparently but even if he did, he didn't address my real question, yes I did ask to do so, but I was planning to keep driving in run-in mode... he didn't advise to do so. That's why I'm puzzled. What would you do if you were me at this point? Keep driving cautiously or do what they told me?\n\nThe servicing dept did mine at 400miles. It just arrived from ED. The iDrive on mine also said it was due, but it said that from day 2 of driving it with less than 100 miles on it.Im continuing to drive it as if I were breaking it in. I requested them to do another break in servicing at 1200 miles... they arent interested in doing it for me though. I called BMWNA,they said they couldnt help me and talk to the service manager. Basically I got nowhere and will have to hope 400 miles wasnt too early for the service\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by_deboWell not exactly, that guy didn't know about my car at all or why it was there apparently but even if he did, he didn't address my real question, yes I did ask to do so, but I was planning to keep driving in run-in mode... he didn't advise to do so.

Keep driving cautiously or do what they told me?At this point I would continue to drive it according to the running in advice until reaching 1200 miles or so, as the reason for doing that remains. Whether you then change the oil/filter again is up to you, but maybe try to observe the recommended service intervals even if you're changing the oil more regularly (which, with modern oils is of questionable benefit).HTH\n\nYes, this is where we are at with BMW UK and HQ, following is the reply I got:Quote:Good morning [ ... ]Thanks for your email about your BMW M2. I’m sorry to hear this – I can understand how frustrating this must be for you.I’ve spoken to BMW [ ... ] who have advised me that the running in service was due. While I appreciate this is usually carried out around 1000 miles, as your car hasn’t been driven the oils and components have still aged over this time.This is called CBS (Condition Based Servicing) so sometimes even if the mileage hasn’t been met, but the car or fluids is old enough the car will require a service.They did check with warranty who advised the service could be carried out without affecting your warranty which you authorised them to do so. As the car has now had the run in service done, the run in fluids have been removed and replaced with the correct oil for the car. BMW UK would recommend following the owners handbook in relation to the tolerance in the engine.While the correctly oils are in, the components haven’t worn as much as they would at 1000 - 1200 miles. The best thing to do would be to gradually progress on how hard to drive the car until the mileage limit has been reached as per the handbook.[ ... ]I hope this information is helpful and I’m sorry for the disappointment that’s been caused during this process.If there’s anything else in future, please let me know.Kind regards[ ... ]I then replied back demanding for a free servicing at 1200 miles, let's see where that takes me.\n\nRemember: You were the one who wanted to change the oil ridiculously early to \"clean the tolerances\", so are not really in a position to criticise others for bullshitting.HTH...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyRemember: You were the one who wanted to change the oil ridiculously early to \"clean the tolerances\", so are not really in a position to criticise others for bullshitting.HTH...I'm not criticising them, I know exactly what I wanted to do. The fact I wanted to do an early oil change for the aforementioned, deemed as wrong, reasons, doesn't mean that BMW who in theory knows better should do something wrong or now tell me that the RIS is done and dusted.I'm a customer who never had such a \"fancy\" car, they are supposed to be the experts.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM FiftyAt this point I would continue to drive it according to the running in advice until reaching 1200 miles or so, as the reason for doing that remains.HTHGood advice. Personally, I change about every 8k but don't reset the service indicator so BMW pays for every other, roughly. I also send an oil sample for analysis any part of the report is the condition of the oil and how long I can safely run the change intervals. Added expense for sure, but worth it to me.\n\nThis is the latest from BMW:Quote:Good morning [ ... ]Thanks for your further email.As mentioned the oils have now been changed but, as the components haven’t been worn in up until 1000-1200 miles, we’d recommend following the owners handbook.Your car does run of CBS so the car won’t need servicing until the car notifies you. When this is due the service light will come on and you’ll be able to book the car in. Servicing the car before this wouldn’t benefit the car or yourself as this would be charged to you and not claimed under the service pack.With this in mind, this would also cause problems to the CBS system for future servicing and any future servicing may not be able to be claimed under your service pack.The best thing to do is to wait for the service light to come on and speak to an Approved BMW Centre.I hope this further information is helpful.\n\nSeems reasonable.\n\nI went for my 1200 miles service and they told me they did it before delivering my car...weird as fuck\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymaguir2I went for my 1200 miles service and they told me they did it before delivering my car...weird as fuckYeah, that's even weirder indeed.

Sounds like a garbage truck coming to a stop.  Living with performance brakes - sometimes I smile about it and sometimes I'm irked by it.A few hard stops from high speed and the squeal is gone.Thinking about swapping pads to something more quiet and less dusty.",

It's like \"Well, where the F*** am I supposed to go from here\" haha. It could be something like the computer saw an out of spec value at one of the sensors for a split second because conditions happened to be the perfect storm for it, tripped the fault code, then never saw the same condition again to re-trip it.Of course we want to tell the dealership ASAP to prevent it from causing a bigger issue, and make sure it's taken care of before warranty expires, but sometimes all that can be done it to monitor the situation and get more data to diagnose with if it happens again.But glad it hasn't come back, even under the additional launch stress you gave it, and I hope it stays that way.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byandrewc89https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1382873https://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1130911Could be anything from a simple sensor failure due to low voltage from not driving it enough in the winter or you may have overheated the diff and damaged something while you were trying to get it up your driveway.

The error message happens to be perfectly normal under described conditions with summer tires. You just have to have minimal understanding of how these systems work and what happened. The differential was working hard as would be expected when buried in snow. That is why you will get this message every time when \"rocking\" the car out of snow in a manual. Don't assume error means something wrong. My car gives the same message if I get stuck in snow and do some back and forth to try to get it out. There was no need to get dealer involved.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAutostrada66Why assume there is anything wrong here just because it says \"error\".

Dealership service tech also mentioned that this was not normal behavior under any operational load.More importantly I was neverrocking the caras I normally would when stuck in snow, as I was not stuck- I just lost traction on a slope for a few minutes. Big difference between rocking a car (and inducing drivetrain shock and gear backlash) and slightly slipping a clutch dude.I'd be concerned if a locking diff had such a low level of usability as I've lived in the upper midwest for over a decade and owned several sports cars with mechanical LSD/Haldex/E-Diff/etc. which never exhibited this type of behavior...\n\nI got this message yesterday along with several others (chassis stabilization, TPMS, collision warning systems) and my DCT would only engage reverse, neutral and 2nd.

It was quite a disappointing turn of events, I'd been making good progress in the morning.So you just had a software update and nothing else?

It has never come back up since then so I really don't know if that update solved it or if it was just a once off software glitch.For what it's worth, I track my M2 as well and I have never had this issue at the track, so it sounds like yours might be a different root cause/issue altogether. Mine is a 6MT, but yours sounds a lot more like a transmission issue rather than a pure diff issue.Best of luck and let us know what the news is. My first track day I boiled my fluid and got crazy chunking on the crap continentals within my first two sessions hah, 2.5 hours drive one way completely wasted because I couldn't even run again as I had such bad vibrations.\n\nYes, it seems like my issue was different. There were issues on the 5V lines and they traced it to a faulty Valvetronic motor so they replaced that and the accelerator pedal module. That has cleared everything so I suppose the diff lock error was probably triggered by a fault somewhere else in the system rather than something with the actual diff. I don't think there was any software update for me, their notes don't include anything and I still have all my coding.I think the transmission issue was probably also just a limp mode due to faulty readings.",

Another nice bonus is that I'm pretty sure that the process updated the iStep on my car.. the steering feels different and better than before, the throttle feels more responsive in all modes, and the burbles are much more pronounced in MDM mode. I'm sure that the last one isn't placebo, my wife pointed it out when I picked her up from work today.

Here is the latest from my CA \"A solution has been identified but replacement part number is not yet in the system. Once parts are available, it would be a on-site repair. Next update timing would be Thursday (5/9). No further detailed information about the recall is disclosed. More than 100,000 vehicles are affected.\"\n\nThanks for the update. I just found out today that my car is also affected. It's sitting at the port right now waiting to be shipped to the dealer so looks like I have some more waiting to do. Dang it...\n\nThis is from my CA.  My car is still in production.BMW has issued a voluntary recall for several types of cars...all 2 series, all 330xi's, all 4 series, the new Z4, M4's and M2's.  This is due to a supplier issue on the driver and passenger side airbags.  Because of a supplier issue in production, the driver and passenger side airbags could become damaged during deployment.There are approximately 11,700 vehicles affected by this.  It affects cars from 2018, '19 and '20.Currently your car does not show being affected by this recall, however, it has not advanced along the production process.  I can see that is was to be built on 4/29, but the car is still in the Assembly finish/quality check phase.\n\nAny updates on the recall?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byctxboyAny updates on the recall?Next update would be Thursday (tomorrow).

The amp killed my dreams currently because I would have the car now and of course get the recall fixed during the first 1500 mile service!!!!!  Cant wait.....in hurry up and wait mode myself!!Hmm. I have been reading on the forums saying that the AMP issue was caused by poor ventilation of the module in the trunk and MY20 supposedly has a revised design that fixed the problem...so ur MY20's AMP was not working even before the car leaves the dealer lot? Probably good to contact my dealer and have them check on it 😂\n\nYes, they replaced the amp and that was the reason I was not able to take it the first time I went to pick up the car.  Literally, I was there the day it was delivered from the port, 4 miles on the car, amp goes out.  As I driving off the lot and my phone would not connect, no sound would come from the speakers at all.  The Sales Adviser came out and and I showed him the issue, they brought it back in and it was almost 7pm at that time.  Therefore I had to leave it overnight to determine the issue.  On the next day Friday, they had to order the amp, would not arrive until Monday, 5/6.  Once arrived and installed, I'm going to pick it up, and the recall comes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The clutch is very good, that's all I can tell you how easily it transitioned from Reverse to First.\n\nOh man...this is just crazy...no idea why a not so complex AMP is having so many issues...any update on the recall from your dealer?

So far, it is still showing Stop Sell, Recall B651119, with no remedy status...I bet BMW has no clue on what is wrong with the airbags and what caused the failure that they found at the supplier or their assembly plant...\n\nI'm in the same boat.  One day before my car gets off the ship my dealer springs the no-sell / knee airbag recall on me.  Besides 2018-2020 M2s it's also affecting ALL 2018-2020 2-series, 2019 330i xDr, all 2020 M4s and 4-series, and the 2020 Z4.  A total of 11,764 cars in the US.  According to the service manager there's been no update from BMW corporate.  That's pretty amazing considering how many new vehicles are affected, and has me worried that this might be a major (i.e. long time waiting on parts) issue.The freaking car is just sitting there on the lot looking awesome...\n\nDid anyone with the knee airbag stop sale / recall get an update?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bynashahDid anyone with the knee airbag stop sale / recall get an update?I realize this thread started 3 days earlier but how have you not seen this:Airbag Recall Updateshttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1611586\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byomasouQuote:Originally Posted bynashahDid anyone with the knee airbag stop sale / recall get an update?I realize this thread started 3 days earlier but how have you not seen this:Airbag Recall Updateshttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1611586Thank you for pointing it out...I don't know how I missed it!",

Do whatever you want with this infoFor what it's worth, this is what BMW says in the manual:InformationATTENTIONOil additives can damage the engine.There is a risk of damage to property.

I was a little confused by my over researching these things. I will stick with just the engine oil and rear diff fluid changes for now.\n\nHistorically, BMW has not considered 6MT fluid lifetime.  All M's had a 6MT fluid change as part of the 1200 mile break-in until until the F80/82 I believe.  It was in the car's instruction/maintenance manual.  But this is when BMW had a more comprehensive, and longer, free maintenance program.  If you plan to keep the car a while, I'd do the flush.  Personally, I see it as BMW cutting corners because it won't be their problem down the road.  I'm planning to have the dealer flush my 6MT fluid at my 1200 mile break-in.  It's not that expensive, and I'm happy to pay for it.\n\nThe 6MT in the E46 from 2002 had lifetime fill (and a sticker on the casing that says the same) - MTF LT-2. Possibly the local dealerships change this stuff to meet customer expectations in NA.",

Now i am approaching 3km, I usually do my routine \"personal-for-new-car\" second running in oil change and diff fluid change.Problem is that when I call up the dealership to order up the fluid, they keep telling me that 1L is the OEM spec.  So I check online and am seeing that some of our Swiss counterparts, thanks M Houbi, are indeed adding more.This makes me nervous so I ask the dealership to check my records on what they did for the 1200km running service and they confirmed they only used 1L.I asked them about it and they keep saying their system recommends one liter but I do think its wrong.I dont like to be a stickler over 17% difference of fluid but the problem is, is that I track and run cars hard.  Low diff fluid to me could mean a huge bill or a crash. Taiwan msrp is usually double the sticker price of cars in Europe and America.Does anyone have the fluid capacities from BMW anywhere because I looked everywhere and there isnt anything in the manual or online.

But given I'm now 2 months past the annual scheduled service, I'm trying to figure out if it's going to cause me any issues with BMW...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydcmacYes, thank you, I will do this from now on. But given I'm now 2 months past the annual scheduled service, I'm trying to figure out if it's going to cause me any issues with BMW...Hard to say, but if it were me personally I would get it in ASAP to get that stake in the ground and start that annual service schedule counter.  Also, consider resale.  A car that was brought in for maintenance on a sporadic basis could raise red flags and lower the value.\n\nMany of us don’t hit the mileage mark in a year.  BMW does recommend the oil replaced once a year regardless of mileage.  Mine had a 8,000 miles on it when the dealer did the one year service.Take it in and get your free service.  Hopefully it won’t hurt your warranty for being late.\n\nYou will be fine. The dealer gets compensated for the annual work, which is one reason they want you to come in.\n\nBecause you changed it at 4k (what date was it), you effectively reset the annual clock at that interval.  Your CBS will never know that you did that oil change.IMO, because you've already thrown the CBS out of whack, you should get it changed again (guessing you're about 6 months or so since your 4k change?) and get the CBS reset.In the future, reset the CBS at every change and least keep a service record for the next owner.\n\nIf you miss your service by a certain amount of time the car will not be CPO able and not be eligable for some of BMW's extended warranties.\n\nJust to close this out, I took it in and they didn't bat an eyelid. All good. My dash now reads Apr 2020 for next service rather than Feb. Thanks for the feedback from all.",

It seems like these electric water pumps aren't as durable as the old mechanical pumps.Mechanical devices are always more reliable and durable than electronic devices of the same function.Electric circuits are very delicate. Moisture, heat and impact shock can shorten their lifespan drastically. Also parts cannot be replaced individually. The whole circuitry has to be replaced.A car driven by battery won't last 20 years with continuous usage but an engine can run like clockwork easily during this timeframe with proper maintenance.\n\nEvery BMW I have owned with an electric water pump has had the pump fail. 50% of the time I was stranded and needed a tow.

I looked under the bonnet and at that point I saw the coolant cap sitting in the engine bay where I left it as well as coolant spluttered all over that side of the engine. I know, I know, stupid mistake (I still can't believe I did this).I followed the trail of coolant and it looked like it only started leaking from the engine 150 feet away from where I parked my car. After picking up the pizza I put the cap back on, drove it home at the lowest revs possible and used a cloth to clean up all the coolant I could reach and then left the car to cool down.I have been reading that I should bleed the coolant system and I have seen some guides on this, but can you guys please advise me what I should do? If any one could show me a picture of where the bleed screw is explain what I need to do to bleed the system I would massively appreciate it!I am taking my car 50 miles to get some parts added tomorrow so I'd love to get this sorted today. Would it be ok to simply top up the coolant, drive the car and get them to sort this out? I would rather do it myself today if I had the right guidance.Thanks in advance and feel free to mock me for my stupidity. I feel pretty stupid for making such a rookie mistake, but hey ho, you learn from your mistakes and all that.Cheers,KarlP.S. for anyone wondering, it was a Spicy Hot from Dominoes\n\nI doubt you lost enough coolant to cause any damage. Sounds like your drive was not spirited, since the cap hadn't even moved from where you left it. Did you notice temp gauge at all on that drive?If you didn't get engine overheating warning, or a coolant low warning in iDrive, then the loss was likely minimal.I would top off the coolant before driving anywhere, and preferably bleed the system DIY as it is possible that, if there is air in there, even with coolant topped off, you may overheat your engine on that 50 mile drive. For sure not worth the risk. Meaning if you dont figure out how to get this done, reschedule the parts install.Guidance wise I wish I could help but have not done myself and i would say call service dept at local dealer and ask them to give you instructions?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byddk632I doubt you lost enough coolant to cause any damage.

Better oils last longer... Crappier oils could last decent on street driving, but with heavy use it'll break down quite quickly.I personally will be running Motul 5W-40 during track season, and flush with 0W-30 BMW whenever its due.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bylongbeachbluem2Has anyone sent in a sample to Blackstone yet?

When you use it, you can seal remaing mix and it's ready if needed next time.Then shine a light thru passenger side of the white rad water container, light  pointing to center of motor. You can then see how water level is indicated inside at seam. Hi tech, nice that. BUT just make sure your rad water level is up the seam, in middle of white container, and its fine.\n\nYou can't find that but the system will tell you if your low....just  added some coolant 2 months ago.\n\nMy dealer mechanic said it should be up the crease on the side. They topped it off for me.",

Its LL01 certified as wel.Car seems to be much smoother as anticipated with fresh oil now to see how it holds up.Going to do a UOA with the dealer provided oil that was done for the 1200ml service. The oil came out much dirtier than anticipated for the OCI but normal for DI BMW engines I suppose. 300V held up buttery smooth on my FA20 so well see how this one holds up after a few track days.Will update with UOA once results are back.\n\nI'm running Motul 300V 5W-40.  So far so good.  Have done several track days as well.  Planning to send in for analysis since I'm only 1700 miles since changed.  Normally go 5k intervals.  I'll keep you posted.Update: got my analysis back from Blackstone.  Looks like the motul 300v 5w-40 is holding up really well. He mentioned the oil looks great and to think of extending interval by 1500 but I think I'll stick to the 5k with the track days.  Planning a few more track days so I'll get another sample at the end of the 5k interval to see how it's holding up.\n\nI was running liqui moly 5w-40 until my 10k dealer oil change the other day. I felt no difference between it or the 0w-30 the dealer put in or the 5w-30 at the 1.5k interval.I switched to 5w-40 as I did my own oil change around 6k and for the \"added protection\"  during so cal summer/fall track days.\n\nGuys - these engines are designed for low viscosity oils (e.g., 0W-30).  BMW engines, in particular, utilize oil for several functions (double VANOS, turbo passages, etc) and the flow rates are affected by a thicker viscosity which will alter flow rates, depending on temperature and passage size.  I recently received a recommendation from a racing engine builder on this subject and his response was - BMW is very specific about oil viscosity and I would stick with their recommendation.Given they ran 10W-60 in the S65 V-8 and S54 I6 from the factory, they aren't doing it for fuel economy reasons.  It's around engine design and best protection/efficiency.It's your engine but factory recommendation is important - for instance, Jeep/Chrysler warns that their cylinder deactivation in the V-8 Hemi will not function as-designed unless you use the factory-recommended 5W-20.My $.02\n\nI agree with what your saying. Stick with BMWs recommendation. They recommend LL-01 oils and the 5w-40 oils mentioned in this thread so far have the LL-01 certification.Other oils with 0w-30, 0w-40, 5w-30 and 5w-40 weights are on the list.\n\n0W-40 for me. You’re only handicapping yourself and potentially harming your car by running 5W-30 or 5W-40.\n\n\"0W-40 for me. Youre only handicapping yourself and potentially harming your car by running 5W-30 or 5W-40\"...Check the NOACK of your 0W-40,  bet it is higher than let's say the BMW OIL 5W-30 or better yet PP EURO 5W-40.  Matching your viscosity to the environment in which you drive is a good recommendation.0W only for the really cold temps say below 20F.Cheers\n\n5w-30 Redline. Us spec and not euro. Bmw uses the 0w-30 mainly for emissions. It shears fast and is in no way better than the alternatives we have at hand.\n\n5W is too thick at low temps. I would only use it if I lived in a very warm climate or as a summer oil.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZM25W is too thick at low temps. I would only use it if I lived in a very warm climate or as a summer oil.I believe in a 5w summer and 0w winter switch if you live in Midwest like climates for sure! The 0w-30 Twin power oil is just a compromise in my mind. Backed by people whom know more than I will ever will.There's a huge gap in knowledge and research when it comes to oil. Transmission, diff and engine oil alike.\n\nData shows that unless you see start-up temps below 10F there is really no engine wear advantage in using a 0W syn oil over a 5W syn oil.  Fuel savings could be small.  OW oils have a purpose and would be a great choice in winters where the average start up temp is 10F or less..My morning garage temps seem to range around 35F-45F (Jan-Feb) so a 5W-30 works best .5W-40 oil outside of winter.  I could use a thinner oil say 5W-30 but my oil temps are 225-240F . Since oil viscosity is measured at 40C & 100C I know my oil at 230F is less than a 40 weight.  Then throw in a little fuel dilution (found in DI cars) and I have a light 30 weight oil once I am at operating temps..So every case and location can be different.\n\n5W viscosity is already significantly higher at 30F than 0W. My garage doesn’t get that cold, but there are many days in the winter where my car will sit outside for a while and temps will get down to 10-15F.Just watch how the 5W-40 pours in the video at low temp. That’s too thick for cold starts.0W for anything below 35F and 40W for track duty provides the most protection at the extremes.\n\nGuess this would cause a problem.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by123BrittAttachment 1764628Guess this would cause a problem.I would look at the actual curves, not a recommendation chart:http://www.viscopedia.com/viscosity-...es/engine-oil/Plus, pour 5W at 30F or 20F, outside of the typical vis curves, it’s thick and slow. It just doesn’t make sense to use it at low temps. There are no benefits.\n\nAgree - at your 15F Temps I would be all over 0W-30..Here in Bama I just stick with 5W-30 BMW oil and or M1 ESP 5W-30 in the wife's vehicle 3L diesel...\n\nI'm not an oil expert my any means, but a lot of people that use higher weight oils in cars with DI equate higher weight with added sheer protection from fuel dilution.That is NOT how it works. Viscosity can be effected by adding fuel dilution, but the biggest part of that equation is the additives that a particular manufacturer uses. Base synthetics (assuming you're running a true synthetic) are generally the same. Kind of like gasoline companies, the only differences are the additives and detergents that they use. Now, this isn't 100% the case, but is largely indicative of the market.So, the point here is higher weight (viscosity at temp) =/= higher fuel sheer resistance.Unless you're in an arctic environment, or driving in the desert in Abu Dhabi, don't change your viscosity.Edit: especially the case with very tight bearing tolerances *coughBMWcough* like the S85, you will ensure that you have very little flow through channels and between bearings.\n\nI'm going to keep it on spec for now. But I wonder if I could switch to a thicker oil later down the line. Over here temps never go below like 80F, especially during the day. So I don't think there's much point to a lighter oil.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byTampaF87I'm not an oil expert my any means, but a lot of people that use higher weight oils in cars with DI equate higher weight with added sheer protection from fuel dilution.That is NOT how it works. Viscosity can be effected by adding fuel dilution, but the biggest part of that equation is the additives that a particular manufacturer uses.

Now this thread and the others are making me paranoidBlackstone suggested I change the oil around 3500 miles. My next change will be at the dealer in like 5 months so I'm thinking I should just go ahead and put it in since it's garaged in Sunny SoCal and there weren't any engine changes for the LCI (as far as I know). You all think I'm good here?\n\nI just tossed in PP Euro 5w-40 last week.  I have one track day done and another planned for this weekend.  I am at 3k miles now so may change at 5k after these track days.On a side note, I did notice after the change to the 5w-40 that the car's idle is a little more pronounced as far as feeling the car shake a bit more.  Not sure if its coincidence or me just being paranoid.  Any of you notice that after the switch?  Feels almost like how a V8 would feel and not sure that is whats in line with most people say on how smooth these engines are.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJTPitschI just tossed in PP Euro 5w-40 last week.

I am quite concerned now, but I'm not sure how concerned I should be. It looks like it is missing the break in service and likely another oil change? If these do not show in the vehicle's status, does it mean it was not done?The car should have gotten checked over before I took ownership and the time/mileage to the next scheduled oil change seems to have been reset to 15,000 km or 1 year as if an oil change was just completed, but there is no service history of this. Could they do the service without it showing? What would be the best thing I should do or am I just concerned over nothing?\n\nThe easiest thing to do, and relieve any of those haunting thoughts, is hopefully get back to the dealer and get a print out of services done. It's doubtful that if a service was done as you feel it should have been, and rightly so, that it was not entered into their system. Go in, sit down and get the full picture. If for some reason it was not done at 12K then it should be done. Those 3K miles are not the end of the world. BUT that service interval registered in system at 12K is how the warranty is maintained. I would make sure they acknowledge that now...instead of later, claiming the car was not serviced at 12 as specified.

    "content": "Hey all! I'm a new owner of previously owned pristine 2017 M2. I'm coming from a 2006 Z4 M Roadster, so am familiar with ///M vehicle oil and inspection intervals. The previous owner barely drove it and the last oil service he did was beginning of the year at 3050 miles. It is now at 6000 miles and the 1 year/10K oil change is coming up in a month. This is fine, since I am used to doubling the frequency of the factory recommended oil changes anyway.However the car and BMW Connected are also showing that a \"Vehicle Inspection\" and \"Emission Inspection\" are due at the same time. I have never heard of these before, so can someone shed light for me. This can't be Inspection I can it? Based on my past experience Inspection I would not arrive until 20-30K. So can someone clue me in please what these inspections are? All the whiz-bang computer wizardry compared to my M Roadster where everything talks to each other is a brave new world for me. I didn't even have nav in my roadster.....Also, can someone point me to a checklist of what is performed at each service interval / inspection. I've been searching online but cannot find anything that is simple and clear. For my Z4M, I had a simple chart that showed mileage and which fluids would be changed, filters replaced, plugs changed, valve clearances adjusted, etc.Thanks!\n\nMystery solved on the Emission Inspection and Vehicle Inspection warnings. As a newbie to idrive, it never occurred to me that these might be user settable alerts for state inspection intervals. I just set both to the year 2040 to essentially disable them. Maybe there is a way to turn them completely off, but it doesn't matter right now. The state will send me a reminder for emissions testing, so there's no reason for my vehicle to be nagging me as well. And the state of CT does not have routine vehicle inspections other than reading out  OBD faults during the emission test. I think the previous owner was from NY which has yearly emission and safety inspections.\n\nCongrats on the new car, you will love it.   I have driven mine 35,000 miles and 14 track days and have not regretted my purchase at all.  Great car and versatile.",

Got mine for around $90 if I recall.The evacuator works great, I use it on my GTI all the time but I am hesitant to ever use it on a car as nice as the M2 (even if I could) since I do believe it can miss quite a bit of oil depending on the oil pan design. It's not a fault of the Mityvac specifically, but extractors in general.The GTI pan I have is baffled (I think to prevent sloshing and starvation/low pressure situations) and a good few quarts can end up staying at the bottom un-extracted regardless of how much you keep pumping- and it's not like you will have the dexterity/visibility to reposition the suction hose to get each baffled section (all just in my experience).",

At some point during the driving, we noticed the yellow engine icon warning light coming on at startup, staying on briefly but longer than the other lights that flash on then go away.  Then, before or when we put the car in gear, the light went away.  It never came back on during driving, and iDrive never said anything about it.  Car didn't behave any differently.  Wife is paranoid that we exceeded the break-in limits and caused a problem.  I say we did not, since they aren't hard limits, just suggestions.  We briefly had the car over 106 mph (170 kmh given by our delivery specialist), but came back within 106 within a second or two.  Did not exceed the 5500 rpms (also given by delivery specialist), though we did get right up to it a couple times.  The more I read about it, the more I think it's a gas cap issue, perhaps something needing to be unplugged and plugged back in, or at worst a faulty sensor.  Honestly, we didn't spend any time trying to resolve this.  We had lots of places to go and had to get driving.  When I saw the light, I believed it was a non-issue, since it went away immediately, so I didn't dwell on it.  My wife is now dwelling on it and wondering what the issue is.It's the light at the bottom left in the picture below.

Literally couldn't find anything in the manual or even online.I'm going to bleed the brakes with new fluid with a power bleeder fitted on the cap - just want to know with others with experience, is it the back left caliper to start first?Lastly are there any funny tricks I will encounter or is it a straight forward nipple to unscrew for the fluid to bleed?Thanks everyone.\n\nYes, it's under a plastic cover piece that you'll want to remove (it's 4 quarter-turn plastic tabs + 1 clip that hold it in place along with the rubber seal that runs along the strut bracing). It's the left side of the car, or top right of the engine bay if you're standing at the front looking in.I have always gone with rear right, rear left, front right outer, front right inner, front left outer then front left inner (remember, there's 2 nipples for the front calipers). I did that based on furthest to nearest to the reservoir.\n\nThanks for the confirmation. Didn't realise there were two bleeder nipples on the front!Also maybe mine is different (I have right hand side drive vehicle) - if standing in front of the car looking at the engine bay, the ABS module is under the plastic tab of the top right, and the reservoir is under the plastic tab of the top left.",

I will check the pressure, out of town so I need to find my friends gauge but this seems like a major firmware update.  whatever it is I must have comfort restored, the rest I can live with.  the current comfort feels far more twitchy than sport did.  why would they do such a thing, did they really think that everyone is 20 that owns this thing?  nothing against being 20 but I am 3x+ that age\n\nThe M2 doesn't have adaptive dampers, so I don't imagine there's actually less damping.

Unless they ripped out your suspension and replaced it with another suspension for no reason and to great cost to them and kept it a secret from you, then it's all in your head. The car does not have adaptive suspension, there is no software that they can change to make the car feel harsher.  If the tire pressure is the same, and they didn't magically replace your suspension, then it's in your head.Maybe someone played a joke on you and put shipping blocks on your suspension?Also this is your problem, because it's your car, and it's up to you to deal with it. Take responsibility for your own choices.  Good luck!\n\nbeginning to think its a flawed update or its corrupted, mode works erratically and dsc does not work @ all.  back to the dealer it goes\n\nI honestly believe the cause of this is you being away from your car for some time, driving a different car during that time.There can be no other explanation for your perceived difference in suspension feel.Other than that, I believe any other difference of feel in the car would be attributed to the car having to re-learn your driving manner after an istep update.I didn't catch if you are driving a dct or manual but didn't recent istep updates change the dct behavior (for the better)...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDabozoI honestly believe the cause of this is you being away from your car for some time, driving a different car during that time.There can be no other explanation for your perceived difference in suspension feel.Other than that, I believe any other difference of feel in the car would be attributed to the car having to re-learn your driving manner after an istep update.I didn't catch if you are driving a dct or manual but didn't recent istep updates change the dct behavior (for the better)...I am open to whatever it is, I spent a month in a 308, I go to europe 2x a year and always rent or lease different cars and I never come home saying omfg wtf happened to my car.

BMW's maintenance programs follow this and only this.i.e. If you want an oil change before the car indicates one is due, that's coming out of your pocket.(1) Does the car monitor the common replaceables: engine oil, brake fluid, brake pads, coolant, transmission fluid, diff fluid, air filter, belts, etc?(2) How do you reset the car's interval memory if service your own car?I assume you shouldn't reset while you're covered under BMW. If you do, it'll delay the service that the dealer was supposed to perform.(3) For the track drivers, does the car shorten the service intervals appropriately?A part of me says trust the engineers, another part says don't trust lawyers and actuaries.\n\nThey are at set intervals from what I can tell.  I have done 5 track days and a couple auto cross days with mine and it still has the same exact interval telling me to change my oil at the 10k mile mark.I just went ahead and changed my own oil and filter, brake fluid and pads by myself.  It's really not that bad to do any of it yourself.\n\n(3) Not really.  I change my oil every other track event, given all the stress, heat, and WOT.  Cheap insurance.  I change my 6MT fluid and diff fluid every year, or if several track events (6+) then I'll service sooner.If you're not tracking the car, my take is the fluid service intervals that are recommended are ok, w/exception of oil.  I service oil every 6-7,000 miles unless track days are involved - see above",

It's maybe even cheaper than amsoil and covers all relevant standards such as LL01. Unless you have shares in amsol or something I would just buy Castrol.https://www.castrol.com/en_gb/united...duct-page.htmlBut if you're going by frequent change intervals and use OEM filters, I wouldn't sweat what oil to use as long as it's fully synthetic.\n\nThe owner's manual (which I haven't read yet) specifies what grade of oil is acceptable.  if the LL-01 FE as stated here is what's required, then that's what you should use.  Now, other stuff may be \"better\" but if you ever have an engine issue under warranty, you want to be able to prove that you used what is required, to avoid a warranty claim denial.",

Flawless...\n\n1500 - flawless as well.\n\n~5,000mi - no issues like you describe.As far as tire pressure goes, I check manually as I have found the values reported by the TPMS to be a little off from what I get for cold values.\n\nI think Canadian LCIs do not have TPMS, it will never tell you pressures or temps. It uses wheel rotation sensors for detecting flats.I think only the Canadian M2Cs have started to have TPMS. Early runflat BMWs may have had TPMS but for the longest time we've not had TPMS in Canada, only the latest generations have started introducing TPMS (again?) to Canada.",

Just don't go nuts.+1Just make sure if you do that never go full throttle as an addition to just hard acceleration. So you can ease into it for maybe about 60% throttle then you should shift. The reason is that the cylinder walls will still be rough after machining and there may be burs that will fall off during break in so your oil will be very dirty. So don't put too much load on it so you don't end up damaging anything.",

I hear it when I am lifting the clutch and the car gently starts to roll or when I am just driving low speed in first or second gear. It sounds a little like a chain/tensioner/rattle. When picking up speed the exhaust/ASD trumps it so I don't know if it's present then.Anybody know if this is normal? Factory warranty ends at the end of this month, so if something is up I would like to know beforehand. I want to ask owner's advice because Belgian dealers see 1 M2 for every 1000 of diesel cars.

The reasoning was that the auto box has a torque converter while in the DCT you could burn the clutch. FWIW.Once or twice won't hurt..... in theory?I'm sure it won't given it's designed to take it. Just ask m2ruderI think at M track days they just want to limit the abuse of the cars a bit and the DCT is perhaps more vulnerable than the auto box in the M5.\n\nI think the manual is clear. It can cause premature wear but BMW wouldn't have included it if it voids the warranty.\n\nIf you wear the clutch on the DCT from launching, they'll consider it a \"wear\" part and make you pay for it. Same as the clutch on an MT.\n\nI agree with those saying that it shouldn't void the warranty...particularly because the dealership enables it when you take the car in for your break-in service. It's a feature of the car.That being said, there are limitations to warranties. Under \"normal\" usage can be interpreted a number of ways, and there is definitely a threshold for abusive driving. For example, a tire may include a warranty up to a certain number of miles...but upon closer inspection of the car that warranty might be voided if the alignment was out of whack for an extended period of time, or you were roasting them in a parking lot doing burnouts and donuts.Hard launching your car, any car, takes it's toll and things will wear faster and break. Remember your warranty is only good for so long. If that part (i.e. DCT box, axles, electronic diff) decide to fail a month after the car's warranty ends...that's on you. I can't imaging the DCT or diff will be inexpensive fixes. I remember something about the electronic diffs in the old e31 8-series being a trouble spot and stupidly expensive to repair.Does anyone have knowledge of what information the dealer is able to extract from the car's many computers that could be used against the owner? For example a counter of how many times launch control was used? OEM data logging or black box?\n\nThere was a thread about this a while back that alluded to a different model (m5, i think). It may be a thread from another forum that was talked about earlier in this thread.Anyway, the dealer denied a warranty claim on the rear because he used LC and at other times \"accelerated quickly\". It was really pretty crazy. I forget the outcome but even if it was ultimately positive it took a hell of a fight and a swim through a river of $hit to get there.\n\nLaunch control is very hard on components. It's slipping the clutches to maximize acceleration. If you have an issue the information stored in the car can be pulled up and it could be denied coverage.\n\nBut..... nothing in the manual states how often or how much you can use it. They also have an overheat safety function installed to limit use when you reach that point. it comes as an option, they promote that the car has the capability and how it enhances performance. It would be like advertising that it makes 365 hp during over boost but oh don't WOT or you might void your warranty.ReallyI am sure all my back to back LC runs were not the nicest for the DCT...... But I didn't buy it to drive Miss Daisy\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bym2ruderBut..... nothing in the manual states how often or how much you can use it.

But I didn't buy it to drive Miss DaisyI agree. I say F it and have fun. I’ve only known two M cars that needed to replace their DCT’s bc of worn clutches: a supercharged E92 M3 with 640whp (older gen DCT) and an M6 race car with almost 800whp. Our measly little M2’s will be fine.\n\nWe don't have same subject here within different forumers.If this is a wear problem. Saying that your clutch worn out less than 2 years (while warranty is still valid) because of frequent launch control. This would be considered as parts wear over time due to owner's driving habit. Some one above made a good point comparing this to a tire as well.If car breaks or has problem that is not due to \"wear\" of the component, and BMW cannot prove that such problem is from obvious fault of the owner, that should be covered with warranty.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypz619I think the manual is clear. It can cause premature wear but BMW wouldn't have included it if it voids the warranty.Exactly.  The trans will likely make it through the warranty period just fine and then completely fall apart when it's on your dime.\n\nThe issue would be one of abuse, no warranty allows for unlimited abuse of the car.  If you are launching your car at every intersection (not what it was designed for) you shouldn't expect a warranty to cover you.  There is a kid on Youtube with an M2 who loves to do donuts and beats the crap out of his car and then posts videos about how he keeps breaking half shafts as if BMW was supposed to design a car for that kind of use.",

A quick shutdown and restart cleared it in all cases.\n\nI've been getting this error warning for about a year now.  Started last summer.  Came on once, then again over the winter.  Had a few other codes pop up during winter and brought car into dealer a couple of times.  Two weeks later, after disassembling most of interior, they found a shorted wire in wiring harness under passenger side seat . No problems for the next 6 months, now the code has returned along with something about adaptive headlight malfunction.  Just pops up at random times, usually resets after car has been turned off for a while.  I have an appointment to have dealer look it at AGAIN next week.\n\nI saw your post regarding chassis stabilization and adaptive headlight malfunction. I have the exact same problem with my 2015 335i. Along with the error messages, I lose power steering. The first time it happened was 3 weeks ago. Turned the engine off, then back on and the problem went away up until yesterday. Parked my car, went to Lowes and when I came back to the car and started it up, I got the problem again. Turned the engine off, then started it up and the problem went away momentarily, but came back after I pulled out of the stall. Did the same turn car off then back on with the same results for the next two attempts and got the same results (cleared errors only momentarily). Finally, after the forth attempt, the errors reset and I was able to drive the car home. My car is currently at the dealership. I am awaiting their update. Did you get any luck with resolving this problem?",

For high mileage drivers I don't know.  I am a low mileage driver.That is not true on my M2.  When they did the 1200 mile service they did not change the next due date.  Mine is due on year from delivery.  My last BMW was due one year from production date.

One year or 10K is fine.\n\nYou solve the paradox by either driving more miles or paying for the 3rd oil change yourself.  Personally I pass on the free oil changes, it is a better use of my time to DIY.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDanGWith full synthetic oil there is no need for a 5K oil change.  One year or 10K is fine.Only exception to this would be if your tracking the car.  2 hours on track kills over 1,200 miles of oil life on the oil life monitor which is a good indication that oil change intervals need to be much shorter when your tracking.  Short of that the intervals that BMW establishes work fine.  Drove my E90 225,000 miles on those intervals and its still going strong.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDanGWith full synthetic oil there is no need for a 5K oil change.  One year or 10K is fine.Agreed.  Ive done Blackstone oil analysis, and always found that with synthetic, I could go well beyond a year and be fine.  For the avg driver that would be about 12k miles, and with this quality of oil, there's absolutely no need to change it more frequently.  I think the compulsion to do so comes from the olden days when 3k miles between was the rule.  Didnt even have mobile phones in those dark ages.   How'd we ever survive.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byHankdollI got my first oil change at break-in (four months into ownsership).

    "content": "hey guys. I just had my 1200 mile break in performed today. I've noticed a few sounds the car has developed and I wanted to see if I was being overly sensitive or if these are actual issues to address1: recently, when near the engagement point of the clutch, I can hear what I'd describe as a little bit of a rattle or chatter. It still seems to engage/accelerate normally, but it's very noticeable if there are not other noises near by / musics off. it didn't do this until after having a thousand miles on it. I had an STi many years ago that started doing this same sound around 70k miles.. but this is a very new car. This one is the most concerning to me.2: the rear differential (or maybe something in that area) has always been pretty whiny compared to my other vehicles I've had. you can hear it whirring and whining especially when 2nd gear or 1st gear and letting it engine brake. most audible is engine braking down a hill. it can kinda sound like a Jetson's car : P3: AC Unit - if you put it on max AC, the thing whistles and screetches some. It's a little annoying, but it's easy to work around: if you put the blower one notch down, it goes away.4: rattle - if the E-brake lever is fully downward, it creates a weird metalic rattle at some point in the car. it doesn't sound like its coming from the ebrake itself, but who knows.. if I pull up on it ever so slightly, it goes away.5: rattle - passenger side A pillar area. mostly on rough roads. it goes away when it's smooth. it's a stiff suspension, so this one's whatever, I am sure more will come.anyways - happy to hear your thoughts if you have any suggestions about any of these. may just have to give it back to the dealer for a bit. I am going to be putting on a louder exhaust system fairly soon and I would hate for them to try to tell me they can't hear the issues so they can't reproduce or do anything about them..  : P\n\nI have the clutch chatter at times which I feel like a lot of people have.  As far as the rear diff making the \"Jetsons\" sound I can also hear that if I am slowly creeping along in traffic in gear letting it idle me forward.  I just think its the nature of the beast.Edit:  I might also add that since its a new car things take time to break in so all sorts of funny noises during the initial miles of the car.  I have had strange noises for almost every new car I have had and just try and turn up the music to ignore it.\n\nthanks - that's reassuring to hear others hear it/have it too. I think I'm just being a little overly sensitive to noise since I just came from a 2018 GT that had a total engine failure after ~2300 miles.I've had a number of cars and really only a couple of them didn't have any sort of audible drivetrain sounds. I sort of expect it at this point too, but wanted to be safe rather than sorry.sounds like I should just keep putting miles on it and enjoying it.\n\nThe car just turned 5k km, also have the rear diff noise at low speed that seems normal, I just noticed a little metalic noise clincking from the exhaust (stock) when I turned on the engine after a week without use, it disappeared then\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byentaiiiehey guys.

Seems to be more noticeable in hot weather and when the drive train is warmed up actually, not during cold starts or shortly after. Notofied my service advisor in advance of my break-in service and he said that the new rear diff oil might be able to take care of that at the 1,200 mile service.On No. 5: I have the same and will have that looked after next week (14-Jun-2018), together with No 2 during my 1,200 miles break-in service. Coming from somewhere top front of the driver side door/A-pillar, pretty annoying (actually not acceptable) on rough surfaces, no issue whatsoever on smooth roads. First thought it is the cover behind the door lever, which is kind of lose on both doors (you can rattle it by hand), but it is not it. I held it in place while driving and the rattle is still there. Will report on the findings after the break-in service.\n\nThe clutch chatter happened to me a few times and when I took it to the dealer, of course we couldn't replicate the problem.  It's not a common occurrence so I've kinda forgotten about it until now.I've got other rattles and squeaks I can probably make a new thread for.  I have just over 6k miles so far and while it's a blast to drive, the odd noises really make me feel like quality is not where it once was.  I owned a Honda before this and never had to take it in for any noise the 35k miles I drove it.\n\nUpdate on No 2:The whining noise from the rear diff I have not heard since the 1,200 mile break-in service, hoping it stays like that.07-Jul-2018 Update: Drove the car yesterday in hot weather and I had a bit of the whining noise again, but only when slowly pulling away.Update on No 5:Rattle was caused by the \"Speaker Trim\" in the driver door. They fixed it during my 1,200 mile break-in service and has since been gone.\n\nmy break in did not help my differential sounds. I've since put on like ~3k miles total, persists. they also took two trips to perform the break in service though so who knows if they even swapped the diff fluid..\n\nMy 2018 has 4k miles on it and recently have been noticing front suspension noise going over some harsh bumps like deep sewers, rough driveway entrances, etc.It's like a clunky rattle.Drivers side seat makes a creaking noise pretty often throughout driving. Doesn't really bother me, but it's there.",

Also, does the break in service cost money ?\n\nThe break in service should be covered by BMW.  I'm relatively new to the BMW world but I can't imagine 1000 km's over the break in service is going to cause any damage as I'm sure the fluids from the factory can last a full service interval and it's possible there's some additives for break in that shouldn't do any harm if driven a little longer.  Just make an appointment with your local dealer to get this done as soon as they can.\n\nIt is very common. I purchased a CPO'd M4 with 11k and it never had the service recorded...so no one new if it had been done. I ran it hard up to 26k and all was fine.Check what the transferable coverage is on the 18's but the dealer might just do it anyways regardless",

Going in Monday morningGood question, I'd like to know as well. If its the same price I don't see why it should be a problem.\n\nWhat makes you think that 40W is better than the generally BMW engineer recommended 30W oil?  Unless you are going pick something like a low viscosity 40W oil that is very close to a BMW 30W (which wouldn't be BMW oil) it is going to be thicker than BMW recommends and I would worry about long term reliability of all the engine valve train adjustments (e.g. vanos and valvetronic) that depend on proper oil viscosity to work properly.Maybe one of the oil gurus can weight in, but that is my take on 30 vs 40 weight oil.  I suppose if you are planning a lot of track time with the engine running at high temps, you could make an argument for the thicker oil as it may give some benefit in that situation, but nothing about your post suggests heavy track use.edit: did some research and the 40W may be among the recommended oils.  In that case, most of my argument is moot.  FWIW, there are a lot of engine oil threads findable with a quick search with far more knowledgable posts than mine.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by2MGood question, I'd like to know as well.

I had the part number of  the new ones but they didn't want to replace them unless their tech could hear the sound even though I recorded two video of it.I eventually convinced them to do it and after that they have been more willing to just deal with an issue rather than go around in circles with me ten times first.\n\nI'm in the south of the Bay Area, and I have two dealers near me, and another not too far away.Stevens Creek BMW and BMW of Mountain View are about equidistant from my home, and BMW of Freemont is notthatfar from where I work.Any of you local folks know which of these is best for servicing?I really don't want them washing my car, that would really put me off going to that dealer again.

    "content": "I have been getting this loud scraping noise whenever I start my car and make a tight right turn. What I have to point out is that this noise then tends to disappear as soon as the engine & the car gets warm.The scraping noise is a hollow, low noise that can be felt on the chassis itself when you're driving (mostly when you make right turns, it has now worsened and can be felt on the straights as well in some cases)  so it's definitely not the soda-crunch noise or anything like that. The car has 12,000 km.What blows my mind is that the noise disappears when the car gets warm and it only happens when the wheel is turned to the right. Still, it's a sickening sound to wake up to because you can feel that's something is scratching badly but I can't seem to find out what it is.I have taken it to the dealer where they replicated the noise but had no idea what can be causing the noise. Anyone experienced any similar issues?-- EDIT: RESOLVED --It was the new exhaust that was mounted in a incorrect way. Problem solved.\n\nOh and what makes it worse is that I live in a apartment complex and our underground 3-floor garage has only right turns.

Seems like I can never get the level to the max...sensor bad maybe?My dealer S/A said that around 6K miles, oil consumption should begin tapering off.Fwiw, I always drive in Sport + except when on cruise when it reverts to Sport.Never hit WOT and never over 6K RPM's.Thoughts?\n\nThat's a significant amount of oil consumption.  BMW, for years, has had a very liberal range for \"normal\" consumption, probably due to the fact that admission of abnormal consumption levels means a warranty action, etc.I'm on my third Mcar (S65 M3, S55 M4, and now N55 M2).  All have been owned since new and I have followed a careful running-in procedure on all of them, followed by hard driving and 10+ HPDE track events per year.

BMW, for years, has had a very liberal range for \"normal\" consumption, probably due to the fact that admission of abnormal consumption levels means a warranty action, etc.I'm on my third Mcar (S65 M3, S55 M4, and now N55 M2).  All have been owned since new and I have followed a careful running-in procedure on all of them, followed by hard driving and 10+ HPDE track events per year.

Dont track as that will give much stress on non broken-in LSD which is as refined as the engine and require longer time to settle than engine does.If you are much worried still, you can make editional oil change before break-in service.\n\nLike alscks0414 said, I think the bigger factor is to not rev too high or hard when the engine is cold, even more so during break in period.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byeeyang92Like alscks0414 said, I think the bigger factor is to not rev too high or hard when the engine is cold, even more so during break in period.Agree totally..

I didnt even notice my rev was so high..https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break-...ak-in_regimensAny potential negative effects would likely only show in the long run. You can compare it a bit with new brake pads, running on old discs. The pad will have more friction at some diameter positions of the disc, as pad and disc don't wear perfectly even across the surface. If you brake too hard, you will have excessive temperatures at certain araes of the pad and disc, which can change the material characteristics in those areas. The break-in of an engine is there to avoid excessive friction and match the surface of the piston rings to the cylinder walls over time. The 5,500 rpm limit is a recommendation, I doubt there is any harm if you went over the one or the other time.\n\nso what temp do you guys recommend for WOT? ive generally been waiting until the dial hits the center?",

On following this forum for about a year after the initial release of the M2 , then receiving my car. Sounds like the little notchiness is a normal thing and I'm not concerned or bothered by it at all.Not sure why yours didn't do it prior to service, but I noticed it on mine. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad on mine, just something that is there. My prior car had a better shifter than the M2 but was a little notchy like the M2. Drove that car for 5 years with no trans issues at all.\n\nThanks for the replies, it seems to be going back to its buttery nature. I guess I need to drive it for a little.",

I turned around and went home. Hopefully it's something simple.Interested to hear what caused this. Keep us posted. This happened on my 2016. Warning went away after turning the car on and off. Havent had a change to go to dealer yet.\n\nCame up as a misfire. I've been out of town this week so haven't had a chance to drive it other than to take it home before I left. Hopefully it was a fluke.\n\nThe miss fire error code seems to be common on new F7's for some reason\n\nI had an issue 3 weeks after I bought the car and got the same warning. Pulled the code and it was a misfire. I took the car in and they found a dud spark plug. Swapped the plug to a different cylinder and the problem followed. Brand new spark plug was just a dud. Hoping it's something similar for you.",

    "content": "I'm interested in ripping out the mechanical handbrake and getting a hydraulic one installed. Is anyone aware of anyone who has done that with an M2 yet? Anyone know any shop in SoCal who could do this? I'm assuming most any race/tuning shop could handle upgrading the mechanical handbrake to a hydraulic one, but I'm not sure since I've never had the conversion done on a car before.Purpose should be obvious, but it's for those Ken Block level slides.\n\nYou'll also need some new steering knuckles if you want to hold a slide that's worthy of a hydraulic handbrake.Also, I haven't seen anything here about anyone doing a hydraulic handbrake, but I'm sure there's going to be some caveats. Like interior trim modifications.",

I had the same thing happen at my last service and I noticed it during the check-in paperwork. They \"read your key\" to get the car mileage for service in, but it seems like the mileage is not pushed into the key at every start/stop cycle.It made my mileage in/out discrepancy look really wide as well, but it's because theinhad been read too low, rather than the dealer actually driving the car a bunch.And yeah, when they update any module in the car, it's SOP to unplug power consumers from 12V sockets. They put the car on a super-fancy charger during the flash process, and they don't want anything extra trying to draw power.  Realistically, something like a dash cam or radar detector shouldn't draw enough to matter, but that's their procedure.  Once I get my dash cam hardwired in, I plan on leaving it on (to make sure they aren't being naughty), but my hardwired radar and lidar gear I always power off before handing over the car.\n\n23 miles is just enough to make a run for lunch or coffee for the whole shop!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byAronis23 miles is just enough to make a run for lunch or coffee for the whole shop!I don't know which is worse - the thought of some shop guy taking my car for a 23 mile run or anyone hauling coffee in it for any distance at all!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bybobertI don't know which is worse - the thought of some shop guy taking my car for a 23 mile run or anyone hauling coffee in it for any distance at all!The service manager is running a coke distribution ring on the side, and uses customer's service cars to move the shit around, since this won't point back to him :-)\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeQuoting this to emphasize it.

It doesn't take much to break a motor in these days. I don't know why folks still follow the old methods from the 70s and 80s. Definitely not suggesting you bounce off the rev limiter in every gear and slam gears as hard as you can, but rev her up and use engine breaking like stated above.

However, still avoiding long driving on freeway.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byakkandoHere is what I don't know.

The manual simply says to keep RPMs under 5,500 and no full load/kick-downs, so there's not a lot there.I don't subscribe to the all the old methods, but to each his/her own.

Since I travel about 50% of the year for work, don't want to run the risk of ethanol freezing in my fuel line when the car sits idle (even though garage is heated, you never know).\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygmzanattaShell's VPower 91 has no ethanol, but it does have some engine additives.Perhaps in Canada but you aren't filling up anywhere in the States with Shell gas that doesn't have ethanol in it unfortunately.",

With the M235, you select Sport+ and at a stop, floor it, and the revs hang around 3500rpms.  Admittedly it's not very effective for maximum acceleration.

I never heard of a manual transmission BMW that had a rev limited launch control like you explained.Maybe the M2 does the same thing.  I've never even thought to try it.\n\nI read about mt launch control on the 2 series forum. Tried it on my m2, and doesn't work. It'll rev to redline\n\nWith BM3 you can modify the maximum revs in neutral but Im not sure if you can manipulate the logic that determines if you want the limit.\n\nIt will definitely happen when they map it out properly, just like flat foot shifting, cold start delete, and all the other goodies that are generally available in the tuning market. This is pretty standard stuff.Also, its more than just beneficial for the massive turbos, it also just flat out results in better times. When all you have to do is floor it and release the clutch at the right time, it removes the extra movement to push the gas pedal. I know, it seems insignificant, but launch control and flat foot shifting is hands down faster for the vast majority of drivers that aren't launching their car every weekend at the strip to maintain muscle memory.",

    "title": "Traction Mode problems",
    "content": "I've had my LCI for about 3 weeks. The traction (MDM) mode is fantastic for the burbles and pops. I've noticed intermittently that after pushing the button there is no change in the exhaust character and it seems to stay in comfort mode. At first it happened once every few days but today I had to turn traction on and off 4-5 times to get it to make sexy sounds. The traction light comes on and idrive shows the change but no exhaust change. Anyone else run into this problem?I've also noticed a lag in the 1500-2000 RPM range in traction mode where the engine seems to hesitate before picking up again. Not like turbo lag but like its cutting ignition or something. Not sure if this is related. No CEL or anything else.\n\nTraction mode puts the throttle in comfort. If you have a manual you will notice it more.  You may also be feeling the traction control since it is still aggressive even in MDM mode.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDavid1Traction mode puts the throttle in comfort. If you have a manual you will notice it more.I'm reffering the exhaust note though. The way it's functioned for me is traction always burbles and pops on deceleration off throttle. Mine is occasionally staying in \"comfort\" exhaust mode and requires turning traction on and off to get it back to burble mode. The throttle sensitivity and auto-rev match function haven't changed, as expected.With the lag, its under light acceleration, <50% throttle application, so I don't think its wheelspin or TC kicking in.\n\nMine does not do it all the time either.  It's dependent on rpm and how quick you let off.  Mine (17) has more exhaust noise in sport plus than just in MDM mode.\n\nFirstly..When you put it in MDM. It'll only make burbles and pops once the car is warmed up..So if you put it in MDM on the cold start, it'll take a couple minutes of driving for the ECU to to make these over runs and burbles because one of the preliminary requirements is that the engine is warm enough (hits a specific temp.)All BMW are programmed to not burble over 5,000 RPM.Secondly, if you run it in MDM. Your throttle response is actually equivalent to sport..Its more responsive than comfort but less than sports +Thirdly, the stock valve are pretty crap, all the exhaust sound the same pretty much.However, on sports+ I believe that over a specific RPM (I think 3,500) it is louder than comfort. But all else remains the same except comfort doesn't allow for engine braking.Hope this clears up your questions!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byiQuietFirstly..When you put it in MDM.

Great info all around, appreciate it!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byiQuietBut all else remains the same except comfort doesn't allow for engine braking.Is this actually verified truth? Comfort does something non-standard to prevent lift-throttle engine braking? (What does it do, open the intake valves a bit to prevent building vacuum?)\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeIs this actually verified truth? Comfort does something non-standard to prevent lift-throttle engine braking? (What does it do, open the intake valves a bit to prevent building vacuum?)I'm not sure the technical side of things, But I can assure you that it downshits (without engine rev matching) at a point when the gap between the revs don't have a large disparity causing a violent downshift.So for example, on a standard manual, it'll wait till the engine speed is equivalent enough for you to downshift and instantly let out the clutch (aka to the point you shouldn't have been in that gear).Something similar to this.ECU Programmed.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byiQuietI'm not sure the technical side of things, But I can assure you that it downshits (without engine rev matching) at a point when the gap between the revs don't have a large disparity causing a violent downshift.So for example, on a standard manual, it'll wait till the engine speed is equivalent enough for you to downshift and instantly let out the clutch (aka to the point you shouldn't have been in that gear).Something similar to this.ECU Programmed.I'm still waiting for my car to get here so I'm trying to understand this, I imagine it will be more obvious once I drive it, but...So if I'm cruising in 4th doing ~40mph, and I push the clutch and shift to 2nd, while the car is in Comfort... are you saying it doesnotrev up the throttle? If I then release the clutch, it somehow \"holds\" that clutch release until the revs have dropped on their own?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byiQuietSecondly, if you run it in MDM. Your throttle response is actually equivalent to sport..Its more responsive than comfort but less than sports +According to the technical chart, throttle response in MDM is in COMFORT and it does feel like it from personal experience.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byD CHOIAccording to the technical chart, throttle response in MDM is in COMFORT and it does feel like it from personal experience.This is correct.\n\nIf the EGT is too high the car wont burble. And it doesnt always burble. My car burbles in MDM and I mean quite violently just roughly 1-2 minutes off cold start.Sometimes if you put it directly into MDM on over run from comfort itll take another throttle application to get it to burble. Normal behavior. You cant expect a DME to change its fueling map half way through... that would be interesting coding challenge.As for rev matching in comfort or MDM the rev match is much more tame so you have two options. Be slower on shift / timing of clutch engagement or blip the throttle yourself in addition or just go in sport or sport+.I usually drive in MDM and I still rev match myself when I need to.As for engine braking on comfort or sport. Its definetly not as aggressive as in sport + but this is mainly for economy. Yes theres still engine braking as in youll be slowing down.But even then all BmWs now dont have 100% engine braking due to turbo setup as well as ECU tuning\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byiQuietI'm not sure the technical side of things, But I can assure you that it downshits (without engine rev matching) at a point when the gap between the revs don't have a large disparity causing a violent downshift.So for example, on a standard manual, it'll wait till the engine speed is equivalent enough for you to downshift and instantly let out the clutch (aka to the point you shouldn't have been in that gear).Something similar to this.ECU Programmed.Yeah, so I have my car now and I have no clue WTF you're talking about. Whether it's in Comfort or Sport, the car certainly engine breaks just fine.I did note that at very low revs (uner 2000 down to 1k) the braking effect does seem to be somewhat reduced, I haven't played enough to figure out if this changes between Sport and Comfort though.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byiQuietWhen you put it in MDM. It'll only make burbles and pops once the car is warmed up..Not true. All you have to do is put it in sport + and accelerate aggressively once. Put in in MDM after that and it will not only burble and pop. It will be the loudest pops you've ever heard. It sucks it only happens like that when the engines cold because it is violently loud and i love it. Try it if you don't believe me. And no you don't have to red line it or anything stupid like that. Just floor it to ~2500 in sport + in 2nd gear and let go of the accelerator. As soon as it makes the farting noise hit the traction button. It will BANG like crazy from then until the car warms up. Just play with the throttle.Quote:Originally Posted byiQuietSecondly, if you run it in MDM. Your throttle response is actually equivalent to sport..Its more responsive than comfort but less than sports +Nope. In MDM throttle is the same as comfort.Quote:Originally Posted byiQuietcomfort doesn't allow for engine braking.Yes it does...it's just delayed. Next time you downshift in comfort just wait a second before you drop the clutch and it will rev match. It's much slower than sport/sport + but it will do it.\n\nWhat on earth Is MDM mode? Does the LCI have this? Id like more burbles if possible and this might appeal. How do you engage this mode?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMaximooshWhat on earth Is MDM mode? Does the LCI have this? Id like more burbles if possible and this might appeal. How do you engage this mode?MDM mode = traction mode in our cars.Turn it on by quick pressing the traction off button near your gear lever/shift knob. A long push of the button turns off all the nannies,  \"DSC Off\" mode. Pops and burbles not as loud as traction mode.\n\nI bought the MPE and it cracks n pops alllllllll the time.I am not sure when the stock flap even closed on my car. I think it was defective to tell you the truth. But a non issue now\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMaximooshWhat on earth Is MDM mode? Does the LCI have this?

    "content": "Hey all - found an issue with my MY'16 stock exhaust and wanted to see if anyone else has seen of/heard the same.  The two brackets holding the stock (non MPE) mufflers to the subframe are fastened with flanged hex nuts that come loose/fall off.  I have 3800 miles on my M2 and the driver side nut came completely off last week, resulting in a loud knocking noise when up/down movement caused it to hit the body. The first pic is the driver side bolt from the frame without the nut.The 2nd pic is the passenger side bracket.  I checked to see if it was tight and, low and behold, it was definitely loose.So, the point is my particular car has an issue with these nuts coming loose and eventually falling off from vibration.  I got a replacement from the good folks at Advantage BMW Midtown Houston free of charge.  The factory nuts don't have any loctite or other locking mechanism on them at all, so my guess is more of use will start to see this issue over time.\n\nThanks for this tip.NOW will have to heat up the garage and go check.\n\ninteresting...... if i remember right my nuts have a mark across themSeriously I think they had been marked as torqued with a torque pen. I will double check when it goes in for alignment",

This was just last Saturday.This is pretty common, they will issue a TSB for issues that are not worthy of a recall so when the car arrives for service it can get the software update or whatever done.The post above is correct, recalls are not done based on model years, especially when they are in production, they are done by VIN/build dates.I think some look at recalls or TSB's as negative, I don't at all.  Fact is since the Chevy Cobalt debacle and punitive damages that were awarded the number of recalls initiated by manufacturers skyrocketed.  They are far better these days of monitoring the cars they have built for potential safety issues and addressing those issues early on versus the old days.  I would much rather get a recall notice and have to get a repair on something before there is a failure that could cause a safety or reliability problem.  The rear diff recall was a great example of this, the manufacture of that component proactively identified that they failed to use the right spec metal during a specific period of time and initiated a recall with BMW immediately.  Sure it was inconvenient but better than a diff failure in 5 years when your car isn't under warranty.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byscadagawdWas there an issue with the gauges?Here's the thread.

Well iv'e finally created an account and this is my first post.Last December, i put myself on the waiting list at Sylvania BMW (Sydney) for the M2. Literally, last December and it arrives in 2 or so weeks (already docked at Port Kembla). I'm upgrading from a Hyundai i30 (I know right, so much for baby steps). Great news is, it was an early July build, therefore an LCIEvery day, i have watched videos, reviews, read forums, etc.. I have only ever seen the M2 about 7-8 times on the road and yet to hear it roar (i have heard the Cold Start though - WOW!)The question that i have today - what's the overall driving experience like during the break-in? Will i still feel a fair bit of power? Looking for your experiences and answers, without the obvious \"It'll still be much quicker than the i30\"  I do drive my brother's Audi SQ5 a fair bit, however i know that this is quicker by about 1 second (which is heaps in car language)On another note - video's do no justice for volume. Is it really loud? And will i hear much of it during the break-in?Incase you're interested - Long Beach Blue, Sun-Roof, Heated Seats (no longer standard with the LCI)Thanks guys!\n\nCongratulation! I went through the same! Waited also about 8 months for my mineral grey and also read everything I could find about the M2, watched every video on YouTube etc.In terms of feeling the power during break in. Well I did it this way: the first 300km I really drove very smooth, especially let the breaks settle by not breaking too hard.After 600 or 700 i went above 3500 rpm, all very smooth, no quick acceleration, just let the motor get the revs without doing a kick down. And after 1000km I adjusted the rpm to the full break in amount of 5500. Still no hard breaking, vary the revs, shift a lot just to also break in every gear in the gearbox, though this oil won't be changed during break in service. Only motor and rear diff oil will be changed.Just before 2000km i nearly drove it as hard as normal but not over 5500rpm!You will hear the sound I promise although I got my M performance exhaust mounted just before delivery but when I test drove the M2 i loved the noise. This was actually the first car ever where I not only had a grin in my face when hearing the sound and especially the pops and cracks but also giggled like a school girl and laughed out loud because inhaftiert so much fun!Now when i heard that there is an exhaust that just deepens this experience i immediately had to order it and never looked back!It is so much more emotion and to me, worth every penny! Yes you have to cut the OEM exhaust, and yes there have been people that had the exhaust coming loose. I never experienced any of these flaws and the only thing I can report is that after 3000km i had to adjust the right side where it is mounted to the car because it got slightly unaligned. This can happen when something is getting that hot and I got it sorted in 5 minutes.Hope that helps to shorten your wait a bit!\n\nHuge congrats on the car and 1st post OP, good work.Power IMHO is honestly the same in break in?? I never quite understand the question that keeps popping up. Launch control gets enabled and the oil gets changed, no magic +100HP. It's just that some follow run in and this keep the revs lower etc and thus it may seem a faster car than before.Don't forget plenty of pics once you have it\n\nWhat JustChris said and truth be told, just drive the damn thing,people go so cray cray about these first 1,200 miles. Don't.  Just enjoy and try not to beat the living crap out of it, ever.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjaflakHi All,For the past year, i have been 'that guy' who reads in the dark and nobody even knows that he's there.

This can happen when something is getting that hot and I got it sorted in 5 minutes.Hope that helps to shorten your wait a bit!Congrats!I am not sure if you wanted break in advice, but here goes in case of you care:First, the engine should be slowly warmedwhile drivingeach and every drive whether during break in or post break. I.e. keep revs below 2500 +/-. I would suggest letting the engine idle statically for 60 seconds or so before driving and warming as stated above. Be certain to frequently ~ very frequently~ vary engine RPMs. No full throttle applications until after 1200 miles, however, never lug the engine. Although no full throttle applications you should load the engine by slowly applying power. Other components need to break in as well so not hard braking, etc. Braking should be firmly and slowly applied whenever applicable in a braking situation. I hope this helps. You may want to search other proven break in procedures by known and respected people in the industry. I have been away from M cars for a few years but am sure you can find some great reading. Porsche's GT guru, Andeas Preuninger has gone on record with some great advice. He may be addressing Porsches but similar rules would apply to each brand. No disrespect to anyone offering advice, however, you should listen to known facts not someone offering what works for them (This includes me of course, although most or all of my advice is objective) this includes BMW sales people who tell you 'the engine does not need break in', 'it's broken in at the factory' or 'drive it like you stole it, it'll run faster'.  My 2018 arrives in a few weeks. My break in will be as described.\n\nSo... my day job is engine R&D. We need to run engines on dynos to measure fuel consumption and emissions. We need stable engines to test, and new engines are unstable. Therefore, to run them in we start them up; check to make sure there or no leaks or problems, and then turn them up to rated power ( WOT @ max power speed) and let them sit 20-40 hours.  We benchmark brand new vehicles and every engine gets the same treatment. Lots of Internet fail around here\n\nI've had the car for 15,000km. Exhaust is not bad, for a stock car sounds great, but uncomparable to an aftermarket exhaust.And driving on normal roads, I don't think the engine ever sees much above the 5,500. And Max power and torque are in that cerci its anyway! By the time you get higher, you'll be in jail 😂You'll love the car. From an i30. It's a massive difference!

I really thought I made a huge mistake until a few days passed.  I got the oil out of there at ~600mi.  my dad was an organic chemist, phd from u of chicago.  smart guy and I heard an ear full about oil growing up.  basically oil changes are cheap insurance.  he created filters for auto industry testing resulting from car engine run ins and i still remember him showing me all the crap that happens on a new or even old engine.  good luck, as other will chime in you will love the car\n\nHeat and cooling cycle matter as components settle in. Short and longer drives with varying load and engine speed. A bit of variable terrain is nice for a boost driven engine as well. Going up elevations, adding some throttle/boost. I drive 3-4 times per day with new power units and let them heat up then cool off.Other owners may have different techniques but I adopted my contacts/ engineers at Porsche for their advice and use it. Early oil changes on a passenger car are needless with modern oil per their research. Track work that is aggressive requires more changes.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bykab_m2Ok so even though BMW recommends engine break-in, everydealershipon the planet has disregarded this for every single demonstrator vehicle they have ever soldI don't get itBecause it's a demo...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydevoQuote:Originally Posted bykab_m2Ok so even though BMW recommends engine break-in, everydealershipon the planet has disregarded this for every single demonstrator vehicle they have ever soldI don't get itBecause it's a demo...What's your point...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byjaflakHi All,For the past year, i have been 'that guy' who reads in the dark and nobody even knows that he's there.

Just thought it was interesting.is it the same as the M235?\n\nNo, the M235 uses the first part number I listed, from the E90.Seems like the second one is M specific for some reason.\n\nTheres a post on the forum about it. Visually they look the same. But no idea if any different. I went with the M part # as its only a few $ more expensive. Better to be safe than sorry... plus what if dealer sees that a non M oil filter was out in and you have engine concerns ?\n\nI would guess that the M-specific part has its bypass valve set to a different pressure, potentially lower. Idea being that you'd rather contaminate the engine with some grit than completely oil-starve it...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeI would guess that the M-specific part has its bypass valve set to a different pressure, potentially lower.

A decent amount of old oil is left sitting there in the housing when you pull out the used element. I usually just soak it up with a couple disposable blue shop rags. Plus you need to be careful not making a mess when getting rid of it. The older system was inverted 180 degrees with a metal outer canister and was a bit harder to deal with initially, but the residual old oil was collected in the canister and easier to dispose of.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeNumber of pleats the same?Not sure the difference in design between part numbers here.I do remember Toyota stating that their filters had something like 20% more pleats per volume than most other filters because of origami techniques.\n\nNo idea if the pleats are different. I guess theres one way to test by weighing it. Someone want to send me a new filter ? :P. I have some super accurate scales.That said the only notable difference I saw was that its made in Germany and has the ///M logo compared to a Mann OEM replacement",

Not sure if there is a SB or not? This may affect other vehicles as well? Anyway, I would just give them a call and see if this is the case and confirm it for yourself.EDIT: Just learned that it is MY dependent. 0W-20 will be an alternative to 0W-30 from 2016 onward.\n\nJust doing some searching about this.http://www.2addicts.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1405462If I recall my last one in Bay Area was 5w-30\n\nUpdateSo I texted the SA that helped me yesterday to clarify on what the service order stated. He said,\"My tech used 0W-30 oil in your car. Our parts dept billed out the wrong oil.\"\"The techs have dedicated pumps for 0W30 oil so our parts dept didn't actually hand him the oil and that's where the confusion lies.

Not cheap at Dealership these days if you wish fo change every 5000 miles. Every 3 months it would need an oil change. So roughly $130 per month for oil change.

    "content": "Wondering if anyone knows the part number of the battery cable nut and bolt?I dont think it matters as both the positive and negative sides look the same but specifically, I need the negative side.  Ive looked on RealOEM and it only lists the whole cable which is 250 bucks plus shipping.No one will believe me but I stripped this nut taking it off!  I was installing the CTEK Comfort Indicator Panel so I just had to remove the nuts on both sides and negative side seemed to get tighter as it was nearing the top (end) of the thread.  I had to put the wrench back on to turn it the rest of the way off and now its clearly stripped.  It did go back on but Im not happy with it to want to replace it.Thanks!\n\nI know it might not be the original, but suspect a local search there for a proper metric nut would suffice...at least give the tension you want for security until you find an OEM factory replacement??? Just a thot.\n\nThat nut was probably designed to not come off entirely on purpose.  You should've snipped the loop from the CTEK lead into a C shape instead of a full ring, then you could've just slid it onto the post without removing the nut.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeThat nut was probably designed to not come off entirely on purpose.  You should've snipped the loop from the CTEK lead into a C shape instead of a full ring, then you could've just slid it onto the post without removing the nut.Sure, I could see that being the case...the positive side came off and went back on without a hitch.

Stop at home depot and save yourself 1000 times the cost lolAgreed!  It's not really a standard nut so I was trying to keep it OEM but they don't sell just the nut and bolt, you have to buy the cable which is 280 Euro...only!

I've spoken with two reps (who double checked with their supervisors) and my own sales associate. The patch just isn't ready yet. So yea my car is parked just sitting there (with dozens of others too it sounds like) a thousand miles away, waiting for me to drive it.

At first they told me some modules needs to be reprogrammed. They did the break in service but then they told me the reprogramming is not ready yet and they will notify me later.\n\nI called BMW 'Genius' at 3pm (hadn't seen this thread yet) for an update, having heard about this when I called on Monday, and asked him if they had a fix ready for this problem; he responded 'yes' with no hesitation and went on to say that they just need to apply the update to the cars that are held up. I'm leaning towards believing him since he sounded quite certain and it's certainly possible the fix was recently completed and word just hasn't spread far enough yet.At any rate, my ED car is being held in Jersey for this reason - it's held at the VPC which means it's cleared Customs and the more I think about it, I'm starting to getabout this 'cause I don't see it as a safety issue and the car is already my legal property. Plus it's not Customs holding it at this point - it's BMW; I had been waiting quite patiently until I got this info Monday, at which point I simply became a wee bit cranky, but now I'm starting to get irked and if I don't get good info on Friday (when I plan to call again), I just might get pissed. The gubment cleared it, it's my property, so hand it over, BMW, and I'll get this done at the dealer when it's convenient for me - I already drove it over 900 miles (of 1200+ scheduled, but that is another story).In the end, I'll keep myself in check because (as mentioned)... first world problems.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCHITOWN1seriesHey guys,I just had my 1200 mile service and they were unable to clear the 1200 mile service message that pops up when you start the car.

This doesn't happen during braking... last time i noticed the jump was during coasting. I've never seen it getting very hot or anything but just wondering what it could be...\n\nNormal, even more so if you are in sport mode this has to do with the cooler right in front of the right tire\n\n10 degrees more than other tires.. due to a heat exchanger being located in that area..\n\nThanks for the explaination guys.

I'm not sure but it might be the differential not the DCT.  As far as the lurch I think that's normal as well.  There is a creep feature meant for stop and go traffic where you tap on the gas and the car will creep forward without any additional gas so as not to wear on the clutch, I think it's just the tranny coming out of that mode.  My first DCT as well but it's known to be a little quirky at creep speeds from what I've read.\n\nHave not experience the whine but creeping forward is a pain in the ass.  My car fits in my garage with about 3\" to spare so I have to get the front bumper to within an inch or so of the wall.  I've got to creep up to the wall and spot the distance from the wall with with a mirror I have mounted on the side wall.  I'll be trying to creep up to it and with 3 or 4 inches to go, the DCT will just say this is good enough and stop.  I'm afraid to try to inch it forward so I end up backing up a foot or two and creeping in again.  I'm putting it down to not being used to it yet (only about 1400 miles on it) but maybe its something I'll just have to live with.  ...and before anyone jumps on, I still happy that I went DCT over stick! :-)\n\nWhen you're trying to creep in, don't use the gas pedal at all.  When you make it partway into the garage, stop entirely first. After you're stopped, give the gas a very light tap and take your foot off it right away (don't hold it). This will put the car into \"creep mode\" and that's the best way to make small adjustments (just use the brake to stop).\n\nAnd you can also use a wooden block under a front-wheel to get a consistent stopping point. My garage is pretty full with either a lawn tractor or snow-blower in front of the car, depending on the season, I have a 16\" 2x8 which stops the creep.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeWhen you're trying to creep in, don't use the gas pedal at all.

The whine sound might just be 1st gear isn't completely engaged?  1st gear doesn't do so well on hills, firmly press on the gas and get it into second, this is easier if you're manually selecting the gears.

    "content": "Hi All,For the past year, i have been 'that guy' who reads in the dark and nobody even knows that he's there. Well iv'e finally created an account and this is my first post.Last December, i put myself on the waiting list at Sylvania BMW (Sydney) for the M2. Literally, last December and it arrives in 3 or so weeks. I'm upgrading from a Hyundai i30 (I know right, so much for baby steps). Great news is, it was an early July build, therefore an LCIEvery day, i have watched videos, reviews, read forums, etc.. I have only ever seen the M2 about 7-8 times on the road and yet to hear it roar (i have heard the Cold Start though - WOW!)The question that i have today - what's the overall driving experience like during the break-in? Will i still feel a fair bit of power? Looking for your experiences and answers, without the obvious \"It'll still be much quicker than the i30\"I do drive my brother's Audi SQ5 a fair bit, however i know that this is quicker by about 1 second (which is heaps in car language)On another note - video's do no justice for volume. Is it really loud? And will i hear much of it during the break-in?Incase you're interested - Long Beach Blue, Sun-Roof, Heated Seats (no longer standard with the LCI)Thanks guys!\n\ngo easy during the break in, follow the guidelines in the manual. the break in service does not change power or engine sound as far as I know.\n\nThere's plenty of power to be had under 5.5k. I crossed 1000 miles just yesterday, and have had no trouble staying under the limit (for the most part). It's a real pleasure to drive. I love how it pulls hard even in 5th and 6th gears (6MT).The stock exhaust is definitely loud enough (at least for my taste).\n\nThanks for the replies! How can i possibly delete this? Iv'e posted in the wrong section, in my opinion",

If so what capacity do i need?many thanks\n\nI have a 2 ton jack for my M3.  It should be enough for your car.  But I wouldn't get the one you listed.  I'm worried it won't have enough clearance for your car.  I had a jack that looked like that and I couldn't get it under my lowered E46 M3.I would look for jacks listed as \"low-profile\".

The only thing is there is a greater range of light weight 'race jacks' with low profile but many won't be rated for as much weight/strength, and the ones that are will be more expensive.  You pretty much get what you pay for in terms of stregth and durability.\n\nIn my opinion the higher the jack capacity the better.I have a 3 ton low profile jack fromHF. I paid $80 on sale. I am very happy with it.It is fine with the stock height of my M2. It is also good on my lowered E46 M3 (dinan springs).It is always good to have a pair of jack stands for extra security.

    "title": "Best Explanation of Oil Types (Dispelling Myths About Oil by /Drive)",
    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comHands down, this is the absolute best explanation of oils of all types. You may think it's a commercial since it is presented by Red Line, but trust me, it's not. It's just great info on a much misunderstood topic.\n\nOh no, this thread is going to explode!  Good video though.\n\nPosted this in December. Some might call me a trend setter.\n\nExcellent video.I wish he had spoken more about the type weights needed for high horsepower applications, such as 1,000hp or more.Also, can anyone speak on fuel injector cleaners?  Are these essentially the same as what he was talking about with fuel additives?  Does anybody have any experience with good fuel injector cleaners?\n\nThree comments#1. The presenter correctly avoided comparing Group 3+ because most high performance oils contain them in some percentage as an additive carrier or as major component.#2.  Per UOAs on BITOG Redline motor oils in the past were usually spent at 7500 miles in BMWs.#3. Base stock is just one piece of the puzzle.  Most currently certified motor oils contain a mixture of G3/4/5 as their base.   Racing oils are a different animal because they don't have the additives required for daily driving.Interesting commercial piece.\n\nJalopnik just did an oil article because Blackstone recently did a study...http://thegarage.jalopnik.com/why-ex...ney-1797241527What do they say about current oils, if one is just daily driving their cars?BTW, I've got a 2007 Camry (DD) with over 250K miles on it...  I've been beating the crap out of it for years and have always used the cheapest oil I could find on the shelves at Wally World. I've been doing the oil changes between 5 and 6K miles...  Basically when I get the maintenance light.The cars was up for a recall because of oil burning...  Never had it done so it does burn oil...  If I don't add oil, I'd say I'm about 2 quarts low when I change it.  Still the engine keeps going and going...  Feels strong too.  Can Toyota engines really take the abuse of running low on oil?  Mine seems too..I guess I'm asking if this redline video is over hyped...\n\nAs one of the comments in the article pointed out, show me longer intervals past 3-4000 miles which is what our cars generally run.  I went 6500 miles between oil service (using the CBS) and took it in because a year came up rather than the oil service indicator.  I'm sure Blackstone (not knocking them) prefers seeing samples come in 3-4K miles as it's more revenue for them than if the public waits double the miles..........\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bycrabu2Jalopnik just did an oil article because Blackstone recently did a study...http://thegarage.jalopnik.com/why-ex...ney-1797241527What's that say about current oils if one is just daily driving their cars?BTW, I've got a 2007 Camry (DD) with over 250K miles on it...

Going strong.\n\nMy AMG burns about a qt every 2-3k miles or so but that's known/expected for the 5.5. I just look at it as keeping fresh oil in her between changes! Lol but been religious 0W-40 per the MB spec upon the car being built. But if I took it to the dealer I know they wouldn't put 0W-40 in her. I'm at 125k miles on her and not a single engine issue over the life of the car and i drive quite hard.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bycrabu2Jalopnik just did an oil article because Blackstone recently did a study...http://thegarage.jalopnik.com/why-ex...ney-1797241527What do they say about current oils, if one is just daily driving their cars?BTW, I've got a 2007 Camry (DD) with over 250K miles on it...

Can't... justify.. watching..\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bym981addictsBravo for Nippon motors!  Third plus owner of Corolla w/220K miles. Mine burns oil so I add oil every week. Going strong.05 RAV4 with over 208K miles.  2AZFE motor is pretty good.   It burns about 2 quarts per change and was never included in toyotas motor recall.\n\nWell at least my 100,000 miles of BMW oil changes were free....I burned oil the first 5k and then it was all good.I've paid for 4 changes before each HPDE season because it just makes sense to have fresh oil before I flog it during the summer.My wife's RDX (2010) takes synthetic 5w-30 Mobil 1-$110 per change, and I drive 120 miles back to the original dealer because I got free oil changes for life #worthit (just hit 122,000 miles).\n\nThe blip on \"fuel additives\" and gas was interesting.  Great post!!!!\n\nCool video!  I learned quite a few things.Sorry if this is a dumb question, but do you guys know what \"group\" of engine oil BMW puts in our cars (M2 in my case)?\n\nM1 every 5-7500. Mity vac makes it simple. Oh, I forgot. No more dipsticks...Marcva@geezermobile\n\nOn my 2012 X5, I did 1200 break in like my M car and did 1/2 cycle oil changes around 7k miles on the V8 turbo.   BMW did  1 or 2 other changes due to the warranty/recall work on the V8. It was burning 1 qt every 500-750 miles so BMW did warranty valve guide seals.The Tech who pulled the valve covers off had to double check the year and mileage and make sure this was the car he had to do guide seals on  because he never saw a x5 motor look so clean.   Zero sludge in the top end of the motor. He said he had done about 15 guide seals when he did mine.  That says something about proper length of time on oil changes.   My SA actually took pictures and sent them to me.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bycrabu2Jalopnik just did an oil article because Blackstone recently did a study...http://thegarage.jalopnik.com/why-ex...ney-1797241527What do they say about current oils, if one is just daily driving their cars?BTW, I've got a 2007 Camry (DD) with over 250K miles on it...

Mine seems too..I guess I'm asking if this redline video is over hyped...Well, if we take the Red Line video at face value, then we can say no, it isn't over-hyped, because he said nothing about running higher classes of oils in your crap-can DD. Pretty specifically, he addressed the behavior of oils at specific operating temperatures, and in track-use scenarios.Basically, the advice in this video is pretty tightly focused on people who use their cars in a performance context. There was some talk about high-mileage motor oil, but that portion of the video seemed really focused on explaining why you shouldn't run that in your LeMons or ChumpCar engine.Think of the Jalopnik article as additional information. The vast majority of people do not track their cars, and therefore demand very little from their engine oil. A 250K service life isn't a whole lot to ask from a modern automotive engine. Engineering and manufacturing technology is so advanced, that the modern engine, when driven at a day-to-day pace lives a relatively low stress life. Any engine that can't reach that service lifespan had some kind of design defect.\n\nI don't know, as someone who reads the bobistheoilguy.com forums, I thought it was a bit light on detail.I am also not sure that their broad characterization of the different group base stocks is totally accurate. RL has a vested interest in pushing their oil, and Group V base stocks are their \"thing\".They also didn't do a great job of explaining that while a 0W-30 is a 0 at 0C and a 30 at 100C, the \"0\" rating is not a fixed viscosity, it's a point on a curve. Even at cold temps, a 0W-30 is never thinner than it is at 100C, so it can't possibly be too thin if a 30 is the correct weight at operating temperature.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bychris719I don't know, as someone who reads the bobistheoilguy.com forums, I thought it was a bit light on detail.I am also not sure that their broad characterization of the different group base stocks is totally accurate.

Although, both viscosity and density continue to drop (oil gets thinner) as the temp increases.   The curve flattens but it certainly gets thinner at say 110C vs 100C.  My BMW oil temp runs around 230F-240F not the 212F (100C) as tested. Therefore , I chose 5W-40 to help accommodate the higher oil temps and DI fuel dilution.\n\nMy sister's dd '98 'Rolla has 265k miles. Regular oil, scheduled maintenance. Runs like a top\n\nThank you for your interest, everyone! There's no doubt that we could dive so deep into oil tech that the video would end up being a day long, but our goal for this one was to touch on the most important topics and keep the video at a watchable length.

    "content": "Hello everyone.I received my BMW M2 for European Delivery on June 6. I absolutely love this car and I don't think I will be selling it anytime soon. (Unless the M2 CS comes in Manual)I was in Europe for 2 weeks. My path was Munich to pick up then went off to Monaco, Florence, Rome, Venice and back to Munich.I was told by the delivery specialist to have the service done at 1,200 miles and not to rev it past 5,500 and keep it under 110.Unfortunately, Every time I called a nearby dealership to do the service, they were booked for a couple of days. Also, I was unaware that June 15th-28th Germany was on Holidays.Long Story short, I couldn't do my service while I was there. I went over by 550 miles since the service was do. I never went over the revs or over the speed of 110.I emailed them my issue that the dealerships would no be able to service my car in the 2 days I stood in the cities. (That was my average in each city)How detrimental is this to my engine, transmission, and diff?My main concern is the warranty void. It's just not fair or right that I was not able to get it serviced and fully enjoyed in the autobahn and Nurburgring.I look forward to your feedbacks.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///M2NYC15It's just not fair or right that I was not able to get it serviced and fully enjoyed in the autobahn and Nurburgring.Did something prevent you from making the appointments before you set off?AFAIK, BMW will do the service at the VPS if they notice it hasn't been done.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byhoyasaxaDid something prevent you from making the appointments before you set off?AFAIK, BMW will do the service at the VPS if they notice it hasn't been done.When I went to Munich, They were getting ready for their holidays.On the trip, I didn't have close to the 1200 miles. It was  after Florence when I was getting close to it. That's when I started to call around to get the service done.On top of that, it was a huge inconvenience when you are also on vacation trying to go and see the beautiful cities.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted by///M2NYC15Quote:Originally Posted byhoyasaxaDid something prevent you from making the appointments before you set off?AFAIK, BMW will do the service at the VPS if they notice it hasn't been done.When I went to Munich, They were getting ready for their holidays.On the trip, I didn't have close to the 1200 miles.

That's when I started to call around to get the service done.On top of that, it was a huge inconvenience when you are also on vacation trying to go and see the beautiful cities.To be honest, that sounds like a you problem. I don't think the hate at BMW for asking for a few days' advance notice is fair. I'm planning a long ED myself, and I'm going into it knowing that I need to make a service appointment.With that said, the service should be done when the car arrives in the states. And, if you babied it, I doubt there was any damage done by the delay.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it one bit.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bytstaffordI wouldn't worry about it one bit.I hope so. I'm just a bit nervous. The good news is that I am getting it delivered on July 24th\n\nMy understanding is the original reason behind the 1,200 mile service is to remove all fluids containing metal from the initial contact between all the metal surfaces in the early part of break-in.  The oil and filter in the engine/transmission and the fluid in the diff keep these particles in suspension but you don't want to keep them in there for an extended time frame (5,000 or 10,000 miles until first oil change).Also, if BMW uses break-in oil (they might, but this is closely-held info) they'd want it out in relatively soon (1,200 miles).Finally, it appears there is software that is flashed upon the 1,200 mile mark...some parameters of the engine are changed prior/post 1,200 mile service.  I'm sure going over by a few hundred miles is no big deal.  The real intent is to have the early service performed at some point.\n\nIgnore the previous post.  There is no break in oil, there is no software change unless you have a DCT (launch control is activated). There is no metal floating around in a modern motor or trans.  Only the diff has a special break in oil so the LSD unit wears in quickly.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygsrbriMy understanding is the original reason behind the 1,200 mile service is to remove all fluids containing metal from the initial contact between all the metal surfaces in the early part of break-in.

Changing all the fluids is important but it's your vehicle.  I just had my break-in service (1,271 miles) and had them also change the 6MT fluid.

    "content": "I have a 2018 M2 on order, with delivery expected around mid-November, and I have some questions about maintenance, specifically oil changes.I grew up in the UK, and have found some really big differences between cultures since I've lived in the US, and one of them appears to be regarding oil changes.Back home in the UK, I never heard of anyone changing the oil in their cars outside of the recommended maintenance, and most cars have had a maintenance minder that somehow indicates when it's required.In my early days of driving, maintenance schedules were much shorter, but as soon as synthetic oil became mainstream, car companies increased the maintenance periods to follow suit.The last cars I had in the UK were a 2003 Honda S2000 (2.0 4-cyl), and a 1999 Peugeot 406 Coupé (2.9 V6). The 406 Coupé had a two year / 20,000mile oil change interval, the S2000 on the other hand, which has a much more highly strung engine, had a one year / 7,500mile oil change interval.For the S2000, I bought my own oil, because Honda dealers weren't used to dealing with S2000s, and I felt that the standard oil might not be suitable, but I did stick to the intervals.I now have a 2012 Jaguar XF (5.0 V8), and I'd says its engine is somewhere in between the Peugeot and Honda in terms of tune. Its oil change interval is one year / 15,000mile.The M2 is a higher state of tune than the Jaguar, and I understand its oil change interval is one year / 10,000mile, which seems reasonable to me.Having said that, in the US, I hear of people changing oil as often as every 5,000miles, and there are plenty of small garages which specialise in only 'oil change for $50'. My question is... who goes to those places?My wife has a 2016 Honda Pilot, which we've owned since new, and the local Honda dealer often sends me promotional emails offering reduced cost oil changes. Again, the car tells me when I need the oil change... why is the dealer offering this kind of service, and who does this?I only do about 7,500 miles / year, so I doubt I'm going to run into the milage requirement for oil changes in the M2, but I'm starting to wonder if I need to change the oil twice / year, or at 5,000 miles?Anyone have any thoughts on this?\n\nBMW recommend a 2-year/25,000km change for Australian M2s. They also specify an annual Vehicle Inspection so I will have the oil changed once a year at that point.\n\nIf you are keeping the car for 10years +, then it may be worth doing intermediate changes but this is entirely dependent on many factors, how often you drive, how hard you drive, start stop driving, what the environmental conditions are like etc etc.I read an article, I think it was castrol, where they carried out  some real world testing on their oil, they left the oil in an engine for 1 year and 15000 mile, then they when removed oil and stripped the engine. They found that the tolerances were factory spec and oil quality was also.I will personally stick to the interval BMW set as I believe they know more than me on this subject and the last thing they want is engine failures or blown turbos,  it's bad press and would cause them a fortune.If you track the car or drive really hard then it could be worth it but again the car would advance your oil change based on your driving conditions.Save your money\n\nGoogle \"direct injection fuel oil dilution\" and that's why you want to change early.Just one of many examples:http://www.lubricants.total.com/news...d-effects.html\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeGoogle \"direct injection fuel oil dilution\" and that's why you want to change early.Just one of many examples:http://www.lubricants.total.com/news...d-effects.htmlIt's the oil company's that sell the oil to BMW with the guarantee that the oil will meet the specifications listed by BMW for the set maintenance duration. There are thousands of direct injection cars still on the roads some with 250000 miles plus and I bet over 50% of these cars stuck to the planned oil change frequency until it was out of warranty and these cars are still going.I really think that you will save money and have no issues if you stick to what BMW are telling and guaranteeing you for. But it's everyone's personal preference and it's always good to read articles like the one you listed.\n\nAlternative BMW Maintenance Schedule (oil and filter excerpts)Enhanced Maintenance Schedule by Mike Miller of Bimmer and Roundel magazinesOnce BMW began paying for scheduled maintenance, lo and behold the “schedule” was revised. Now, magically, the cars hardly need any maintenance at all! The 1,200-mile break-in service was done away with except for M cars. Engine oil suddenly lasts 15,000 miles (dealers are supposed to use BMW synthetic oil).This is an alternative to BMW’s factory-recommended maintenance schedule. It is not, “Mike Miller’s maintenance schedule.” It is actually BMW’s maintenance schedule, more or less, which was used prior to Free Scheduled Maintenance. It also represents my opinion, based upon my experience and that of my readers, tech advisors, and professional BMW technicians both dealer and independent.Traditionally, BMW performed a break-in service at 1,200 miles on new cars, which included changing the engine oil and filter, manual gearbox oil or automatic transmission fluid, and differential oil. With the advent of Free Scheduled Maintenance, BMW stopped performing break-in services except on M cars.I have seen that the engine and driveline oils in new modern BMWs are literally full of metal at 1,200 miles – as has always been the case with any new car. For this reason, I recommend a 1,200-mile break-in service.Oil and Filter Intervals BMW recommends their Castrol 5W-30 synthetic motor oil in all BMWs except contemporary M cars, for which they recommend their Castrol 10W-60 synthetic motor oil. The factory oil change interval is controlled electronically, but is presently about every 15,000 miles. If you are running BMW’s oil, I recommend an oil and filter change interval between 5,000 and 7,500 miles.---Although I've followed the computer for my past three 3-series and used premium fuel, I've decided to change the oil and filter in my M2 every 5,000 miles and only use Shell V-Power fuel even though it's not tracked and only used locally on nice days (garaged for the three winter months).When I took it in recently for an oil and filter change at 5,000 miles, it turned out to be free since it was within 3 months of the computer scheduled September recommendation.If you can afford it, I'd say go for more frequent service intervals. It can't hurt and the records  will help if/when you sell the car.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byRAM_E90_F87Alternative BMW Maintenance Schedule (oil and filter excerpts)Enhanced Maintenance Schedule by Mike Miller of Bimmer and Roundel magazinesOnce BMW began paying for scheduled maintenance, lo and behold the schedule was revised.

I've heard some interesting facts about the recommended 0w oils BMW is now using. They shear QUICK with heat. I think one of the best preventative maintenance items we can change on this car is oil. Switching to an ester based 5w-30(preferably not euro rated) is a huge step. The new oils were designed around emissions, not all out performance.I say euro rated doesn't matter but it depends on the manufacture. Some with actually step up quality in order to meet those guidelines, while some great companies may have pull back from their ideal mixture. I don't think a(Euro rated) oil means better any longer. These ratings can also be focused towards emissions. Any oil made from a super high ester based stock is going to be superior. Some products that come to mind are the standard Redline 5w-30 and Motul 300v. As far as weight, Redline recommends the 5w-30 for best wear, flow and heat protection. The 0w-30 is great for LOW temp climates. My oil temps actually dropped 5-10 degrees when the engine is heat soaked at cruise.If you want to stick with the BMW 0w I would change every 3-5k depending on your driving style and climate. Im guessing you could push a ester 5w much further.And absolutely do not throw a 10w in there haha.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bykiysersosaeIf you are keeping the car for 10years +, then it may be worth doing intermediate changes but this is entirely dependent on many factors, how often you drive, how hard you drive, start stop driving, what the environmental conditions are like etc etc.I read an article, I think it was castrol, where they carried out  some real world testing on their oil, they left the oil in an engine for 1 year and 15000 mile, then they when removed oil and stripped the engine.

If I choose to use for example Redline 5w40, will this void the warranty?2. Can I ask the dealer to use my oil rather than his?3. If you're changing oil more regularly than the service reminder tells you, are you also changing the filter at the same time?4. I've changed oil and filter many times on previous cars before, but my Jaguar requires . a kind of pump to suck the old oil out; there is no sump plug. How difficult is changing the oil (and filter) on the M2?5. If I want to change the oil (and maybe filter) myself before the regular service reminder tells me, how can I know when it's going to go off again a week after I did the change, and the dealer is going to want to change my brand new oil!?!\n\nTwo data points on this subject:1) I know of three examples of //M cars that had factory maintenance (longer oil drain intervals) and exhibited oil sludge and deposits at the 60,000 mile+ time frame.  Two motors were S54 engines.  One was an S65 engine.2) An engine builder I know (rebuilds hi-perf cars, to include BMW, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche) has said that, with BMW's reliance on oil pressure/oil flow for the VANOS system and other very complex mechanical/electromechanical operations w/in the engine, fresh oil and exact viscosity (0W-30) are critical.   His advice was \"don't change the viscosity and keep the oil as clean as possible.\"\n\nAnother question on the subject:At what point would a dealer not cover a scheduled maintenance oil change since the intervals are ~12000 mi? If I decided to bring the car in at 7k-8k miles would they decline the free service?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byasmith918Another question on the subject:At what point would a dealer not cover a scheduled maintenance oil change since the intervals are ~12000 mi? If I decided to bring the car in at 7k-8k miles would they decline the free service?I had mine done at 7500.  They seemed surprised that I would want to do an oil change before the free maintenance one.  I said I would pay out of pocket for peace of mine because I'm the one who has to deal with the car out of warranty, not them.  I told them not to reset the maintenance estimate date so I will get a free one at that time.  I don't claim to know if it matters or not to do more regular oil changes on the M2, but it seems like a small cost to me so in the back of my mind I am not always wondering if I should have done it or not...",

The reality is all cars need a break in period regardless of what a manufacturer says.  Brakes need to be bedded in, tires need miles to get the mold release agent removed and all of the powertrain components get broken in through the early miles.

    "content": "Two days ago I drove on the German Autobahn and the car dropped into limb mode twice... I did not know what it was the problem other than a drive train failure mentioned by the on-board computer.I can tell it is not the most pleasant feeling doing 240+ kmh and having your car go into limb mode, but OK. After the second limb mode message I decided to get the oil level measured since I thought that would be an easy fix.I measured the oil and it was low. Problem found! It is weird that the car does not measure the oil level itself and gives me a warning. In my previous cars I got a message when it was low, the M2 did not do this annoyingly.

There were no viscosity numbers! Why only mention the BMW oil brand type and name of the product, and why not just mention the viscosity numbers that you can put? Previous cars mentioned that, why not here...In the end I went to a local dealer 10 minutes from my stop at the petrol to double check the oil type and even though they had a M2 in the parking lot they could not find out what oil was required. After some minutes calling and searching we found it!Oil level is now back to normal and no limb modes so far! Let's see what how it runs later today.

I did not know what it was the problem other than a drive train failure mentioned by the on-board computer.I can tell it is not the most pleasant feeling doing 240+ kmh and having your car go into limb mode, but OK. After the second limb mode message I decided to get the oil level measured since I thought that would be an easy fix.I measured the oil and it was low. Problem found! It is weird that the car does not measure the oil level itself and gives me a warning. In my previous cars I got a message when it was low, the M2 did not do this annoyingly.

I need to double check but I think it was 5W30.MR\n\nCheap bastards. They should put it 0w40 for all M models.If you wish to keep the car after bmw warranty switch to 0w40 asap.\n\nYellowflash210w40 from BMW ?  (I'm new to BMW world)\n\nRead your car manual, it's approved.Also, bmw have BMW branded oil 0w40 M power oil.http://www.bmw.com/com/en/owners/acc...ord=motorenoelRegard, @MR. drivetrain issue. I think that his oil reached little bit high temperature + he had 1 litter oil less over maximum, that's why I think that could trigger the limp mode, as he drove over 240+ in 7 gear in 5-6k rpm range.If he had bit ticker and more quality oil then shitty 5w30 this problem wouldn't appear.But yeah, as I already mentioned. If he doesn't want to keep the car longer than 2-3 years use the shitty approved ones that they put in everything.\n\nI have read several places and the Latest on the Smoking Tire Review of the M2 stating that the car is prone to overheating and going into limp mode...As far as oil goes the lighter oil does run cooler but a Grp V oil like Redline 5W-30 which is on the thick side almost a 40wt is know for handing high heat.  The ester base oil is one of the best.  The key is the Grp V oil -- just handles the heat better..\n\nI also had this warning twice in my M2 when I was doing 260kph. My car has only 12,000 km and my oil was already refilled. So I can tell you it has nothing to do with the oil. My dealer looked at it and they said they did an engine 'update' and now everything should be fine..Also it has nothing to do with overheating, I looked at it and the oil temp was just on point.\n\nListen Mr, you need to calm down...\n\nI also got the CEL light ON few weeks ago. My car has now 20K Kms on the clock and totally stock. Oil level is perfect.Took the car to the official dealer and they re programmed the car, and seems to be finde since then.Funny but the DKG logs changed and in normal mode, it changes gears at lower revs than before if you driving slow.\n\nFinally I am back with a report on this matter! Sorry it took so long, but we made a slight mistake in deleting the failure codes from the computer before going to the dealer...This meant that I had to go back on the autobahn to do the runs again, but only when the weather was decent enough to floor it on summer tires. I now finally did it on Tuesday!I can confirm that I had the issue again! Go back to 5th gear and floor it! The car jumped into limb mode on the first run I did touching 210 kmh. I did it many times again and the problem did not occur again. It is so freaking random that it feels like you are on the edge of the sensor reading, and sometimes it happens and sometimes it does not.Yesterday, the M2 went into service and I had my dealer look at it! Surprise this morning the big news came! The dealer connected BMW M and they suggested a software upgrade. They installed PUMA 62732575-01, but I am not 100% sure what this upgrade did. Also I have feeling they did this upgrade to fix something else, because the work order is far from clear. The car did not really run smoothly at start up, so I asked them to look at that as well. They dumped all in one section of the work order and then wrote next to it, we did a PUMA upgrade. I am like \"Uh yes but for which problem was this... One of them or both?\".I am investigating it now and I will come back when I know more. I think they only looked at one thing and that is it. Is there anyone who can find out what this PUMA upgrade does?MR\n\nOK more information today!As discussed above, over the past days I managed to get the error again. The outcome was the same issue as I reported before and the dealer installed a new PUMA upgrade (62732575).The dealer responded to me that this upgrade allows the car to be reprogrammed and is able to adjust its parameters to the new set up fitted to the car. This is what they said:There is also a factor of adaptation values. After programming, the values have to be re-learned for each specific engine regime. Might be, the symptom will not reoccur.The next step is now testing and seeing if the problem reoccurs in the car. I need to drive back to Germany to test it. Not sure when I have the time for this, but might be back in Germany with the car at the end of this month. As soon as I know more I will keep you guys posted.MR\n\nCrazy.  Good luck and keep us posted.\n\nThis is valuable information. I've been trying to figure out why my car would consistently go into limp mode near the end of my track sessions. I theorized temperatures but maybe it's a known software glitch?\n\ndamn this is not good news.  was hoping the m2 would handle the rigors of track use.  m235i-r then?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDrKevM5This is valuable information. I've been trying to figure out why my car would consistently go into limp mode near the end of my track sessions. I theorized temperatures but maybe it's a known software glitch?Only way to find out is why it goes in limb mode. Just make sure to connect a computer and check the messages. It tells you a lot!Never delete them! Always keep them in the system because the dealer needs to see them to be able to do a fix or upgrade.MR\n\nIf you guys think changing oil viscosity is going to save you from what is clearly boost/temperature related limp mode, then we have bigger problems. This car really should not be going into limp mode on the highway, irrespective of 5w30 0w40 10w60 whatever.Heat is my suspicion given that horrific intercooler design. Still, since we are talking highway driving, something is happening in software. Bad IC temp sensor maybe.\n\nI am not sure if this will help....but at Sebring my car went limp twice until I figured out that it was a fuel issue. It seems that at 1/4 left on fuel gauge the pick up in the tank has issues with lateral travel. Now I just head in to fill the tank once it drops below half on track and no problems.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byTwtI am not sure if this will help....but at Sebring my car went limp twice until I figured out that it was a fuel issue.

No one else?  Plenty of new M2 owners would love to hear what you ended up choosing and why.\n\nI declined all the pre-paid maintenance because this is not a DD and time will run out long before my mileage will. I did buy the X-pel and tint thru the dealer since the work will be done by an outside shop I trust. I was able to negotiate the cost for this below what the dealer was asking initially.\n\nI went with the four year because i drive this car more than my i8 and truck. And the last two services of my e92 m3 before trading it in for the m2 was just about $2k. It made sense for me to roll it into the loan than pay out of pocket for all those services. I know I'll hit the 50k mark in less than four years\n\nI bought the free maintenance upgrade @ $600.  BMW changed their free maintenance services for 2016 in that wear & tear items are no longer covered such as brakes, wiper blades etc.  The upgrade now includes everything.\n\nI picked up the $600 maintenance add on because it covers brake pads and rotors as well as the clutch.  Not that I expect to need the clutch in the first 3 or 4 years but it's a small price for the insurance.\n\nWhat are these prepaid maintenance options? Dealer-specific products?I thought there was Ultimate Care+ ($600) and Ultimate Care+ and Ultimate Care Bundle ($2049):I was planning to get the $600 plan because it was a no-brainer.\n\nMy 235 needed brake pads at 28 months.  I expect the M2 will need them sooner.  The 600 upgrade to include wear items, including brake pads and rotors, seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nI passed as I only put about 4k/yr on my \"daily\" driver.\n\nOP your 3 year for $1500 includes different items than the websites 3 year $600?\n\nThe $600 also allows transferability of the maintenance as well, which could increase your resale value. Important in the add on benefit is how long you will own the car. Brakes alone are not really covering the additional expense and who cares about wiper blades.\n\nBMW ultimate care made a ton of sense to me for only $600 for my M2. My 235i needed brakes at 7k, 11k, 19k and 27k miles.",

    "title": "Warranty & Servicing",
    "content": "After researching a few weeks back I now have a W37 allocation, with what seems to be the popular LBB, Executive Package, 6MT, Apple Car Play configuration.I've now got the agonising wait until mid-November when it arrives, but that does give me time to think about some of the options that I might want, and also to think about extended warranty and servicing options.One of the reasons that I'm planning on changing cars to the M2 is that my current car, a 2012 Jaguar XF Portfolio Sport (NA 5.0 V8) is out of warranty and included service plan, and it's started to really be quite expensive to maintain. Nothing has gone wrong with it yet, and it's even still on the original tyres and brakes, but the last service, which was just oil change,filters and checking stuff, cost $1,800 and the next one I've been told will be $2,200!When the Jaguar inclusive servicing ended, they did offer an extended service / warranty package, which I declined, because it was $4,000 if I remember correctly. Now that cost doesn't seem as extreme, but I'm anyway hoping the M2 will be slightly cheaper, and want to think about the most cost effective way to plan for servicing over the course of ownership.Looking at theBMW USA service page about Ultimate Care, I put in the details of a 2018 M2 with 10 miles on the clock assuming a start date of today, and got the following costs out for Ultimate Care+, which covers warranty and servicing, including wear and tear items (I think):3 years / 36,000 miles - $6004 years / 50,000 miles - $1,3495 years / 75,000 miles - $2,3496 years / 100,000 miles - $3,4997 years / 125,000 miles - $4,549The first thing that I noticed about this, is that the 2017 MY M2 configurator offers Ultimate Care+ and Ultimate Care+1 combined for $2,049, whereas the service website this totals $1,949; a $100 saving. There is a tag line which states\"PURCHASE ULTIMATE CARE+ AND AN EXTENTION PRODUCT WITHIN 90 DAYS OF VEHICLE IN SERVICE DATE AND RECEIVE $100 OFF.\", so perhaps the costs I bulleted above include this discount!?!The other thing I noticed is the explanation that shows\"As an owner or lessee of a new BMW, you can decide to add this coverage at any point before your BMW reaches the end of its current coverage.\", so the Ultimate Care+ extensions can be added any time until 3 years after you buy the car!I'm not convinced that I'll use up brake pads / wiper blades / clutch in the first 3 years, but I might in the future, so I probably won't be getting the Ultimate Care+ $600 addition initially, but may very well opt for the additional few years once I know if I'll be keeping the car beyond 3 years.What are others doing with this?\n\ni just took delivery of mine 3 weeks ago from stevens creek in santa clara.  i originally signed for the 5YR/75K which they gave me for $2749. after much consideration, i called the next day to cancel.  ill re-assess when i get close to the 3yr date.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydaftshami just took delivery of mine 3 weeks ago from stevens creek in santa clara.  i originally signed for the 5YR/75K which they gave me for $2749. after much consideration, i called the next day to cancel.  ill re-assess when i get close to the 3yr date.So you're at least under the same understanding that you should be able to get the coverage later, when you're close to 3 years ownership... that's good to hear.By the way, you're obviously close to me in the Bay Area. I'll keep an eye out for your car, though I've not seen any M2s in the last few days...\n\nyup, i'm in the peninsula/southbay mostly. ive only seen one other in the wild, an LBB.\n\nWhat's covered?\n\nI seem to remember you can add it any time up until maybe 6 months before the end of your term (so you can add warranty up to 3.5 years)  - and I think you had to be the original owner or buy it from a BMW dealer when purchasing your used car.  I'll confirm.EDIT - OMG, this is just for service?  Crazy to pay that much!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydoug_999I seem to remember you can add it any time up until maybe 6 months before the end of your term (so you can add warranty up to 3.5 years)  - and I think you had to be the original owner or buy it from a BMW dealer when purchasing your used car.  I'll confirm.EDIT - OMG, this is just for service?  Crazy to pay that much!I thought, perhaps incorrectly, that it was for servicing and extended warranty. Maybe I'm wrong about that.Having said that, my Jaguar cost $788 for the 4th year service, $1,322.60 (after a $250 discount coupon) for the 5th year service, and will cost an estimated $2,200 for the 6th year. All of this was just routine service, with no wear and tear items besides filters, oils etc.That would be ~$4,310 for years 3 ~ 6, which would be $3,499 with BMWs Ultimate Care+ extension.If it's only servicing, then it's questionable, but I really don't know what to expect for servicing costs with the M2. I didn't expect the Jaguar to be as costly as it was, and it's one of the main reasons I'm planning to get rid of it!\n\nUltimatecare is just service, not a warranty.  I'm not sure if BMW offers an official extended warranty...\n\nI think these service packages are a rip off particularly if you don't drive hard. If they do not include brake service then it's even more of a rip off. It's the most expensive oil changes you'll ever do plus the intervals are too far apart imo.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byZPrimeUltimatecare is just service, not a warranty.  I'm not sure if BMW offers an official extended warranty...Hmm... then it doesn't look too good then.I guess no-one has any idea of the longer term servicing costs on an M2 yet then. Even the earliest M2s are still in the free service window, and since it lasted for 4 years in 2016 MY, they'll be out of warranty about the same time as the 2017 MY cars. 2018 MY cars are in production now, and should start showing up in the US in the next couple of months, so by the time I've got to make a decision on extended service contract, there will be almost no information on the possible costs!Perhaps I should look at the parts cost of common things like brakes, rotors, clutch etc. to get an idea...",

I strongly recommend it for anyone who is going to do a European Delivery.\n\nI ramped up my engine speed and throttle usage as I got closer to 1200. I started upping the load on the engine after 800. Runs strong.\n\nProbably not the answer you're looking for, but wouldn't it just make sense to stick to exactly what the BMW rep said? Losing your warranty and/or potentially causing damage to the car you just spent a whole bunch of money on doesn't seem like the most propitious start with your vehicle. Stay strong, and drive it like you stole it when you break 1200 miles.\n\nEhh I wouldn't worry much about the max speed restriction. The big one is avoiding WOT and <5500rpm which lends well to piston seating.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bystefanEhh I wouldn't worry much about the max speed restriction. The big one is avoiding WOT and <5500rpm which lends well to piston seating.On the point of WOT, if the M2 is anything like my 135i, you don't need to get the gas pedal anywhere near the floor for 100% throttle.\n\nOne of the theories is that break-in oil is different - lasts shorter and provide less protection. Therefore better do things less crazy.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bystefanEhh I wouldn't worry much about the max speed restriction. The big one is avoiding WOT and <5500rpm which lends well to piston seating.What??? You realize that the rear axles go into the differential and they spin at the tire speed that you are going. They say not to exceed a speed to keep heat down as the thicker break-in oil likely doesn't lubricate good enough above that speed!  I would not exceed the speed. More so over WOT.\n\nHere we go again...Drive it.Don't get on it until warmed upGo easy on brakes for first couple hundred milesThat is. People are so crazy about this 5,500 rpm thing.

People are so crazy about this 5,500 rpm thing.  Do not fret the car will be fine.Ha! I didn't mean to start an argument. I was genuinely wondering what damage I could have caused to my car by going hard on it for a Nurburgring lap and for a pull or two on the Autobahn.It seems there's a lot of speculation about what exactly is going on during break-in, but there are no real concrete facts. Most people just say something along the lines of, \"It wouldn't say there was a break-in period if there wasn't.\"That said, I plan on taking it easy for the rest of the trip.Thanks for relaxing my nerves!\n\nMy mechanic is an ex-BMW tech who started his own shop 18 months ago. His advice was to not sweat it too much, but to have the 1200 mile service done before really getting on it. Even if that meant doing the 1200 a tad bit early.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byShockwave93Hey guys!I picked up my new M2 on Monday in Munich.

I did a group trip with a bunch of other BMW Canada customers and we our leader was an ex-BMW test driver and ex-Ring-taxi-driver, he told us for the first 2 days (around 500-600km we should try to stick under 160km, then after that 170-180 would be alright until the break-in service. After I had the break-in service the manual does say to still keep it easy for a while but I couldn't stick to that very well since I had to get to the Nurburgring, I hit 255km/h on the Autobahn there, then did 9 laps of the ring (8 Nordschleife, 1 GP+Nordschleife), then Autobahn to Hamburg this time only getting to 240km/h. Ugh, that traffic and construction was painful!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bytstafford^^^What app is that?I'm using Harry's Laptimer in my Porsche. Is that some sort of BMW lap timer thing?This is the built in BMW Lap timer. It measures not only lap times, but g-force, rpm, speed, corner speed, throttle position 0-60 and maybe even more that I can't recall. It automatically recognizes the track you are on.

Harry's can work either way or use both in tandem.Video can be captured with the GoPro (also an app on Connected Drive) and can be combined with the lap timer. I personally haven't done that, but one of the instructors combined them with a lap at Thermal (Adam Seaman).

Get some air moving over the rotors and calipers, no? Enquiring small minds want to know :-]I've never heard of doing it \"30 times\"Quote:Repeat this procedure approximately 30 times.What in the hell...I always followed the StopTech white paper (here).Here's the StopTech procedure (which also states that 30x might be necessary - crazy):Quote:For a typical performance brake system using street-performance pads, a series of ten partial braking events, from 60mph down to 10mph, will typically raise the temperature of the brake components sufficiently to be considered one bed-in set. Each of the ten partial braking events should achieve moderate-to-high deceleration (about 80 to 90% of the deceleration required to lock up the brakes and/or to engage the ABS), and they should be made one after the other, without allowing the brakes to cool in between.Depending on the make-up of the pad material, the brake friction will seem to gain slightly in performance, and will then lose or fade somewhat by around the fifth stop (also about the time that a friction smell will be detectable in the passenger compartment). This does not indicate that the brakes are bedded-in. This phenomenon is known as a green fade, as it is characteristic of immature or ‘green' pads, in which the resins still need to be driven out of the pad material, at the point where the pads meet the rotors. In this circumstance, the upper temperature limit of the friction material will not yet have been reached.As when bedding-in any set of brakes, care should be taken regarding the longer stopping distance necessary with incompletely bedded pads. This first set of stops in the bed-in process is only complete when all ten stops have been performed - not before. The system should then be allowed to cool, by driving the vehicle at the highest safe speed for the circumstances, without bringing it to a complete stop with the brakes still applied. After cooling the vehicle, a second set of ten partial braking events should be performed, followed by another cooling exercise. In some situations, a third set is beneficial, but two are normally sufficient.I guess I was more curious as to why someone wouldn't do a bed in procedure when first taking delivery of the car...of I if just misinterpreted what someone said previously in this thread\n\nToo much information, I need a nap now, so many different pad compounds and rotor materials out there nowadays. Look at battery technology for example, what use to be the correct way to charge may kill your new battery prematurely. Hard to keep up sometimes....\n\nhah...yeah, everyone's got an opinion/theory/truthAnyway, anybody know who makes the stock pads? Are they Brembo?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bylax01hah...yeah, everyone's got an opinion/theory/truthAnyway, anybody know who makes the stock pads? Are they Brembo?Yes.

A service guy told me on the phone that they may need to reprogram the car to get rid of this error. Not sure he really knew what he was talking about. I will address it at 1200 mile service.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byQMAny update?  I have the same issue. It happened after I used the sos button once to set up bmw connected drive. Call went fine.

Not sure he really knew what he was talking about. I will address it at 1200 mile service.Sorry, just seeing this.Yes - the com box needs to be replaced, and there are none in stock anywhere. I'm waiting for mine to come in - they told me they'd either have to pull one from a car on the production line or get a new one made, basically. They estimated 12/1, so it shouldn't be long now.The car is totally drivable in the meantime, and the funky errors I'd been getting have been much less frequent since the first week or so. I haven't pressed the SOS button recently, so that might be why. I'll report back after the box gets replaced.\n\nFollow up - got the combox replaced this week, and everything is fixed! Just in time, too, since it started throwing a bunch of \"SOS call failure\" and \"lighting system failure\" errors again. It's really nice to feel like I finally have a \"complete\" new car.It sounded like the dealer got a bunch of boxes in at once, so maybe the supply is opening up. Hopefully it won't be an issue for new production moving forward.\n\nIt has happened again to me. Now the SOS call malfunction is permanently illuminated and appears as an error asking me to contact service.Additionally, the navigation system is no longer working in my car (doesn't place me on a road) in an area I know there's good cell service so it should have no problem with location.Additionally, the idrive 5.0 no longer recognizes voice commands.I have video of all of it. Taking it to the dealer next Monday. Will give update when I have one.\n\nJust happened to me. They are replacing that box. I will tell them about the battery. Supposedly there is a service bulletin on the issue now.",

I typically buy cars used instead of new so this is rather new to me.Thanks.\n\nEngine need load during break in. So taking in 1400 miles of interstate freeway driving for would not be good for the engine.\n\nthats interesting advice and something I'll have to keep track of. I think if this is the case, then i'll have to ship the car from texas and pay the 1500 bucks.\n\nFunny.... What prevents you from varying engine load/RPM on an interstate?!!\n\nRead the manual guys... It states exactly what is not allowed!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymoldcadFunny....

I've done it before.\n\nWellllll, it's an ///M, so what you doing on the interstates anyway...Find yourself some twisty roads and enjoy the drive.  Let's see, 1 day on the interstate, 2 days on secondary 'fun' roads...~gs2gf\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydammitcubsthats interesting advice and something I'll have to keep track of. I think if this is the case, then i'll have to ship the car from texas and pay the 1500 bucks.You can absolutely drive the car home if you want to, just don't use cruise control and vary your RPMs as much as you can. May also want to get some blue masking tape to cover the front of the car and the mirrors to prevent stone chips. Good news is by the time you get back your break-in will be done, you can change the fluids and be on your way.\n\nAnd then there are also those who opt for European Delivery of their ///M cars, give it the beans on twisties of the Black Forest (Bavaria - Germany), Switzerland, Austria and/or Northern Italy, and also lap the Nürburgring before dropping off the car at BMW.I will give my level best to respect the run-in instructions.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byArtemisAnd then there are also those who opt for European Delivery of their ///M cars, give it the beans on twisties of the Black Forest (Bavaria - Germany), Switzerland, Austria and/or Northern Italy, and also lap the Nürburgring before dropping off the car at BMW.I will give my level best to respect the run-in instructions.yes this will be challenging for me but according to the manual if i can keep it under 5500RPM it should be good right\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymoldcadFunny.... What prevents you from varying engine load/RPM on an interstate?!!Just fluctuating between 70-90ish on the freeway is not varying the engine load enough.  Breaking in a car at highway speeds is just not ideal for a new motor.Unless of course you literally want to get off the freeway every three exits and get back on so you're actually going down in to first and back up to sixth over and over again.  That would certainly make for a long drive though.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byepinfrenJust fluctuating between 70-90ish on the freeway is not varying the engine load enough.

That's in my opinion way more ideal than just going on a highway. Just being on the mountains doesn't mean you have to go over 5500 rpm or be at 100% throttle either.I'll absolutely be cruising in the mountains when it's time to break in my F80. Just go easy.\n\nBefore driving back to Ohio from PCD, I planned out a route that took me on a variety of roads, highways, and freeways. I heeded the break-in recommendations the entire way and never felt like I way babying the car or missing out. And it was so much more enjoyable than the typical 'let's get there as quickly as possible' freeway trip.I'll be doing the same thing with my M2 PCD later this year. The break-in instructions would probably be harder to follow if I was doing ED ...\n\nI'm really happy to see this topic, I was planning to research it. Thanks, dammitcubs!Now I need to plan my 600 mile journey through oil drilling and wheat farming country -- hope I don't get run over by any rigs or tractors.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMR.Read the manual guys...

THX in advanceSearch on the forum there is a topic on how to set it up.You need to enter a VIN of pre-production car and then you have access to all the data.MR\n\nI actually drove first 500 miles on the way back from a dealership. I tried to vary my speed from like 80 to 50 mph and it was pain in the butt because there is a limitation as far as when you can drop the speed to 50 mph since it is \"highway\" I think following every bit of break-in procedures will be very hard.\n\nYou have to load the engine guys. Full throttle on and off to compress and seat the rings of the piston. Those of you who are \"babying\" your break-ins are doing irreparable harm to your pistons. You'll experience better gas milage and power if you vary your engine speeds and load the motor. For example, hit the highway and do 40 - 80 mph pulls at full throttle at low, mid and then higher rpm's maybe 10 times. Do an oil change and you'RE done. Thats the break-in.FYI you do know that before any cars leaves the BMW factory ill go through a dyno pull...right?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byRingMeister01FYI you do know that before any cars leaves the BMW factory ill go through a dyno pull...right?Really?

How could they? They would be encouraging you to break speed limits and potentially endangering other motorists by ripping in a car you are yet familiar with.Every race motor from Moto GP to Formula One are done in similar fashion on an engine dyno.IMO this suggested break in by manufacturers are to get you familiar with your new car safely.. It's their attorney that wrote what's in your manual.When I bought my $36,000 Panigale R (I'm just representing that this is a valuable bike) the dealer  told me to go straight on the highway and do 8 full throttle 4-5th gear pulls from 100-160 (aerodynamic so you need high speed for wind resistance). Motor is a gem.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byF1zboQuote:Originally Posted byRingMeister01FYI you do know that before any cars leaves the BMW factory ill go through a dyno pull...right?Really?

They show the pull and the computer with instruments measuring power output. Then the car gets released. I think they now test the motors before they go in to save on production delays, not sure but really cool.",

The gas door lock is clicking each time as you indicated.I'd take the door skin off and vacuum it out...Thanks for testing. I was also able to confirm this last night after much observation (opening, closing, and listening) haha.Took my car back to the shop (Service King - DO NOT USE) this morning for the 3rd time and the shop manager agreed to personally take care of cleaning the glass out from the inside of the door. Apparently the process is quite intricate and short of taking the door off the car or getting a new door altogether, there is no way that every little piece of glass can be removed from the crevices. Guess I'll find out when I pick it up later. Hoping for the best.\n\nSorry to hear your car got damaged but I have to call Bull S*** on the shop not being able to get all the glass 'bits' out.  My wife's Q5 was broken into some time agoand both the front and rear passengers side windows were shattered, bits of glass everywhere including inside both doors.Took it to the Audi dealer to have it repaired and they got every single piece of glass!

They claimed that my insurance adjuster wrote up the quote \"a bit light\" and only covered vacuuming the inside of the door out rather than removing additional components to get every last small piece. Honestly, it just amazes me that the shop did a bare minimum cleaning job and expected me to drive away with the door sounding like a baby rattle.",

The noise is not consistent in fashion to the revolution of motor speed or anything else for that mater.  It comes and goes and sounds very similar to this video at 1:10 min only amplified.

I hope you figure it out!Also, probably not it again but some other sounds people might hear is flywheel chatter. I believe our flywheel is pretty light for a dual mass, when my car is warm I can hear it really well, I enjoy it though. It's not aluminum single mass/blow your brains out loud.And at certain times I can here a little metallic rattle up front, from the belt assembly, not nearly as loud as that but I've heard it. Along with upper engine noise from our light as hell 0w30. When I switch to ester based 5w30-40 redline oil Euro mix the car is much quieter. That weight shears like a 5w40, it's awesome. It's Probably the valvetrain. Significant difference, I'm going to run it all the time. I'm sure 300v is even better.\n\nThanks for the suggestions and comments guys, I'm convinced it's related to the belt drive system. My best bet is to make my own journal and request the dealership make record of my concerns & request detailed copies.  I'm known already for being that neurotic PITA customer because I called ahead to my S/A requesting a \"Top Tech\" for my 1st service.  Before handing them a 60K check & request not to wash, at delivery I pointed out noticeable scratching/marring on the entire top of the rear bumper.  My guess is from the wires that check/top off the battery, also chips in the door frame from carelessness.  My XPEL/Detailer cured some but not all problems.  Wish I had the time & physical ability to work on my own cars still.  First time in 12 years anyone but myself has worked on any of my vehicles. If someone experiences the same problem or has luck regarding this noise addressed by the dealer, please let me know.\n\nI created a similar thread about the chatter a while back:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1269389As you can see FUMAN had it checked out by a BMW technician who deemed it normal. I still think it's too loud though.\n\nProdigy, thanks for the repost I do remember seeing that before. Please keep me posted if anything worse becomes of it.\n\nJust to reiterate, the sound I'm hearing is a rapid higher pitch ball bearing tapping noise in/out of sequence.  Almost if someone dropped a very small bearing into a spinning aluminum wheel.  If no one has had any major issues by now I'll just keep an eye on it, thanks for your help.\n\nIs it like this noise??I went to my dealers and they are checking where the sound comes from...Do you guys know anything about it?Thanks.",

I would and did follow the BMW break in procedure, its very simple and generally the folks that build the cars know what is best.  Avoiding the constant speed is a challenge at times but as long as your varying the RPM you should be fine.  I drove mine on several extended highway trips (2 hours or so) and just varied my speed and gears to keep from running the car at a constant RPM for too long.  Stayed under 4,500 rpms which is pretty easy to do actually because the car had good torque.   Having said all of that BMW does run their cars at the Performance Center without following their own break-in procedure, of course they are selling those cars after a few months without a warranty so take that for what it is.  When I did my 2 day M school I think the lowest mileage car was about 800 miles so they may do a shorter break-in.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypruettfanCongrats on the car, its always a big day.

Can they be accessed through the wheel arch or is it a bumper-off job Alternatively is there a fuse/relay?I wouldn't mind just taking a quick look myself (I'm an engineer) as it's most likely just a loose connection or something. I have recently fitted my black grilles - not sure if this is related when moving the top of the bumper around - it would depend on where they are I suppose.\n\nNot sure the location but looking at Realoem.com they show that there are two horns, a low pitch and a high pitch.  Sounds like one of yours is not working.  I wouldn't worry about it and let the dealer fix it personally but perhaps you Brits are like New Yorkers and don't use turn signals because your too busy laying on the horn :-).  It is also interesting to see they have several horn configurations based on country and even have a hot climate version.  Nothing like governments regulating everything to make life more complicated.\n\nActually, the horn stuff is often due to \"regional preferences\" from what I've read.  In the US at least, I don't know that there is much in the way of horn regulation other than probably a maximum decibel rating and probably a suggested range of tones...\n\nThanks guys, I managed to get a slot yesterday morning and they replaced it for me, 1/2hr job.I must say, annoying as it was on a new car - it was damn hilarious!!And yes, us brits (especially BMW drivers!) spend a lot of time on the horn - there's a lot of bad driving over here, elderly people and people who generally shouldn't be allowed on the road... it's making me angry as I type! ?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCibbersicksThanks guys, I managed to get a slot yesterday morning and they replaced it for me, 1/2hr job.I must say, annoying as it was on a new car - it was damn hilarious!!And yes, us brits (especially BMW drivers!) spend a lot of time on the horn - there's a lot of bad driving over here, elderly people and people who generally shouldn't be allowed on the road... it's making me angry as I type! ?Probably European driving license ppl and haven't adapted to driving on the left yet...\n\nMaybe consider getting a tug boat horn, that will fix all that.Quote:Originally Posted byCibbersicksThanks guys, I managed to get a slot yesterday morning and they replaced it for me, 1/2hr job.I must say, annoying as it was on a new car - it was damn hilarious!!And yes, us brits (especially BMW drivers!) spend a lot of time on the horn - there's a lot of bad driving over here, elderly people and people who generally shouldn't be allowed on the road... it's making me angry as I type! ?\n\nVery useful thread for horn stuff!!",

    "title": "Rear Axle Differential Lock",
    "content": "So I get this malfunction now when I start to drive away after I turn the car on. It doesn't turn on until I start driving away usually. About 1 week ago it only turned on randomly while driving not immediately when I started driving away after turning the car on like it does now.Another thing to mention is that from what I feel so far it does not affect anything at all performance wise or suspension wise. The car still feels exactly how it did before the malfunction.I am pretty heavily modified. BM3 tune, catless dp, FMIC, MPE, Chargepipes, Aquamist Meth Kit, Eventuri Intake, Ohlin Coilovers. This malfunction happened on its own out of no where. I've had all of these mods installed for some time now with no issues whatsoever. So before I have to take almost everything off and go to the dealer I want to know if anyone here has any experience or insight as to what this could be. I'm a 2016 car with DCT. I know there were some recalls on the differentials but when I had my car for the first 4-5 months I called the dealer numerous times and they checked many times for me to see if my car was under the recall for the differentials and they were adamant about it not being affected by it. So I asked one of my buddies who was a bmw tech and he said it could very well just be a sensor or harness that got messed up; He said he's seen that many times and it just was a sensor or something similar usually.I don't want to take the chance and leave it like this much longer so I'm planning to flash back to stock and hit the dealer next week in hopes of them fixing it under warranty.Anyone have any ideas or clues?? Thanks!!\n\nJack up the back of the car and spin the wheel.. see if it is locked...\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMcPurrsJack up the back of the car and spin the wheel.. see if it is locked...Okay thanks for the heads up. So just get both rear tires off the ground and spin the manually with my hands? See if they spin? Thanks sorry never knew this before. Appreciate the help!\n\nWell in N of course, so make sure to block the front wheels. Safety first.  If the Diff is not locked, only one will spin (the other might go backwards). If locked, they should both spin the same way. Wont fix your error, but at least you will have piece of mind that it is either the diff, or the computer\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byMcPurrsWell in N of course, so make sure to block the front wheels.

Long story short it was a sensor failure because of voltage drop. That's the code that came up. Which makes a lot of sense now because my battery had completely died like 2 weeks prior and it started then. Anyways they cleared the code and I drove it stock tune for a while then flashed it back to BM3 tune and everything is perfect thank God. They said if it comes back at all bring it back (obviously) so hopefully it's good to go!! Thanks again!!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byM2DynamicThank you all for the insight and the help it's much appreciated. 2 days ago I decided to go in and flash back to stock and everything was fine with bmw.

    "title": "Shell V-Power NiTRO+ Premium",
    "content": "I've been using Shell V-Power NiTRO+ Premium per BMW's recommendation. For most brands, premium has typically cost 40 cents more that regular (20 cents over mid-grade), at least in my area. I noticed this past weekend my local station is now charging a 95 cent premium. Since I can afford an M2 and the cost to maintain it, it's not that i can't pay it, I just feel like their gouging their customers. I did report it on the Shell web site, but I expect them to say their dealers are independent and are free to charge 'whatever the market will bear'. BTW, if you sign up on their web site, you can get a 3 cent per gallon reduction.Anyone else notice significant Shell price increases?What are your experiences with Sunoco super premium?.\n\nSummer formula change? They do that in Chicago as a reason to charge more. They make the switch when it gets warmer.\n\nCostco Gasoline\n\nHere in Chicago, Premium gas has been a dollar more than regular for years now. It's not only Shell, it's every gas station here in chicago. Unless you go to a Costco or Sams Club. The cheapest Shell I have found in Chicagoland area is 70 cents more for premium. I trust Shell the most, so I always fill up there.But I do remember when it used to be only 30 cents more. If you ask me, there's definitely some type of corruption going on. They're charging more for premium gas (more expensive cars, more wealthy people).\n\nSomeone will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe everyone is using the same gas in your region. The only difference branding has is the additives put in the fuel. But all brands are buying from the same refineries/pipelines etc.If you're using top tier gas, I doubt you'll ever have an issue.\n\nI just got a reply back from Shell. They're giving me a 'one-time only' 10 cent discount on my next fill-up. I guess the profit margins for big oil must be slim.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byRAM_E90_F87I just got a reply back from Shell.

It used to be .20 over the regular price, but now the average is around .60 difference.  I have found a couple stations that are .30 - .40 over regular prices.  These are usually Sunoco stations 87-91.  93 is usually .20 more than 91.  Shell is usually around $1.00 over regular in my area.Love gas buddy\n\nCry me a river.\n\nyou damn near have to pay to breathe nowadays so i don't think anyone has put any thought into premium gas prices.....but kudos to those that are savvy to beat the system-- even in small ways it adds up over time.we could always be paying way more than 2.90-$3 a gallon for premium fuel due to other constraints that we don't appreciate; its all about perspective\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDay LaborerI get at least 20 cents/gal off each fill up at Shell.I typically use fuel rewards and fill up at least 20 gal each time.When I get gas, I typically bring some empty gas containers to make sure to hit the 20 gal mark.This ensures me to get 20 cents off as you get 10 c/gal every 8 gallons.If you decide to sign up, please use this link so I can get a 25 cents/ for the referralhttps://www.fuelrewards.com/fuelrewa...16a0662715bc9cI signed up, thanks\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bymiiipilotI've been irked about this since gas prices came back down.

It seems like the regular, nominal, spacing between grades is gone (+10 cents, +20 cents) and now it's more like +30 cents and +75 cents.

E85 is great unless the car will be sitting for a long time.\n\nHere in Alabama we can get 93 Octane Pure Gas -- which I run in all my small engines and have run in my N54 with some improvement in MGP but not sure if I could really notice any performance gain..The ethanol does attract water and is known to harm the Piezo injector crystals in the N54.   On my N55 similar to your M2 N55 variant - the Bosh injectors are used due to the crappy fuel quality we have in America..So, you could gain MPGs but the extra cost does not equal the MPGs gained...Accordingly,  pure gas in a car that will be sitting for long periods of time  should use pure gas as well as small engines like a leaf blower where the corrosive nature of ethanol just kills the carburetor..However, I am a big proponent of high tier gas with quality detergent .

Your DME will compensate and will hit your target AFR's.

When you had HPFP problems, how much E85 were you running?

With a tune usually you have more timing and what not, would it still be safe to use 2 gallons of E85 with a 93 octane tune (91/E85 blend in tank)?

And what type of tune were you on?That's crazy that the DME can compensate for this.I think I'd like to continue to use this 2 gallon blend just to up the octane to 93, but I'd also like to be tuned on this blend eventually. With a tune usually you have more timing and what not, would it still be safe to use 2 gallons of E85 with a 93 octane tune (91/E85 blend in tank)? No risk to the HPFP?Thanks!When you start pushing your boost up is when I started seeing problems with the HPFP. That being said a tune probably won't run as rich of a target like JB4 on a stock tune. Stock boost levels were fine, car ran great.So theoretically it could work and it's very plausible, it will have to be just right. Map 1 is an additive map that targets 4psi. Map 2 is the same but targets 6psi over stock. That's around 20-21psi In overboost so we need that E30 blend for knock.I would see crashes in 4th gear around 7k on the e30 blend in map 1 and around 5.5-6k on map2. Pulled like a train though.I'm sure PTF  could work out a custom e30 map for you. That's our only way short of port injection right now, DME tunes that alter fuel scalers\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byashburyn54When you start pushing your boost up is when I started seeing problems with the HPFP.

Just to get to 93 octane.\n\nThe difference in performance between 91 and 93 octane hardly seems worth the extra cost and effort involved.  Cali gas sucks, sorry.It's been mentioned above, but there's generally no real reason to start blending E85 with 91/93 unless you have a car that's been tuned/mapped to take advantage of it and run higher boost because of the effective higher octane.",

Will the M2 get free 50,000miles maintenance or is that just a dream? If it is just a dream, how much should i be expecting?Thanks in advance!If you are in the US , the  warranty program for 2016 models is *absolutely* preferred over the warranty on the same vehicle as a 2015.BMW pays for nearly all normal wear and tear including wiper blades and brake pads.   It's very satisfying and gratifying to have no other out of pocket expenses other than your car payment.\n\nOn this car, when you consider the brake pads/rotors alone, it is a good reason to shoot for a 2016 rather than a 2017.Sure, the 2017 will theoretically be LCI, but that won't likely be anything drastic anyway.  The change  in maintenance is a real consideration factor moving to 2017 models and beyond.\n\nBut, are the brake pads and rotors expected to wear out before 50k for average M2 driver?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byzenmasterBut, are the brake pads and rotors expected to wear out before 50k for average M2 driver?No. But many owners will attempt to get them replaced before the warranty is out. 3-4 years of regular driving at 15-18K miles a year sounds about right for average brake wear.Also, define \"average M2 driver\".\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byzenmasterBut, are the brake pads and rotors expected to wear out before 50k for average M2 driver?I predict mine will at ~ 48,500....\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byzenmasterBut, are the brake pads and rotors expected to wear out before 50k for average M2 driver?Ummmmmm, wouldn't you rather have them covered when you find out you aren't .. \" average \" ?My dealer replaced my brake pads at 8K miles...I'm \" above average \"This is a sports car!!If you plan to drive it like miss daisy then you probably won't need a thing during the warranty period other than fluid changes, and you probably could have just gone with an M235!M CAR BUCKET LIST- Join BMW CCA (what- you haven't already ?!)- take a car control clinic/attend an autocross- do an HPDE in it- take it to a car show /concours event- take it on a Driving tourLather, rinse, repeat ...That's 4 years and 50,000 miles of FUN\n\nSo true, M3 Adjuster so true!\n\nThe \"average M2 driver\" would be wear due to most M2 driver's driving.

I'm sure your AH3 uses a harder pad for sure though.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byskiiipiIt really sucks the BMW Canada's warranty doesn't cover any of the wear and tears like brake pads,  rotors or clutches.Covers pads and rotors.

    "title": "BMW maintenance options",
    "content": "I am buying a new 2017 m2. I am debating about buying the maintenance options. I owned a 2011 e92 m3 and drove it for 6 years putting 50,000 miles on the car. I never needed breaks. And most of the maintanence was basic things like oil changes, transmission fluid, differential fluid etc.I will out about 6000 miles per year on the car and won't drive in winter. I think the main difference between the new and old maintanence program is brakes, clutch for manual cars, wiper blades, and a few other things. All the basic fluid services are included.Should I pony up the $600 or the $1800 to turn it into what it was before for 4 years? If the brakes are as good as my e92 m3 I don't think I will need brakes during the first 4 years of ownership. That was the main selling point by the dealer.\n\nI have the extended maintenance on my 2014 335i but declinded for the M2. I've come to realize I don't like being locked into the dealers schedule and what the dealer thinks I need. Obviously, they have more expertise than I do, but I'd rather have the flexibility to do things on my schedule. Also, I don't like the worry that I won't get my money's worth if I get rid of the car early or if I don't meet criteria for a bigger item like brakes.Another quick example: I had a nail in a tire and my low oil light had just come on. I was 50 miles away from being eligible for service (2050 miles on maintenance minder). I asked if they would do the maintenance while I was there for the tire and low oil, and initially, they said they couldn't because it wasn't due according to maintenance plan. I asked the guy to check with someone else and they were able to get it approved, but it still annoyed me. In the end, I'd rather just pay out of pocket when it's time for stuff to be done.",

The break in oil is quite a bit thicker to catch all the particles and etc. Wish I'd taken samples, oh well.As for launch control, pretty sure that's for DCT only. I have 6MT too, so can't comment if it was enabled at the start or not.\n\nMy 1200 mile was done recently and all I can say is life wide open above 5500 rpm is good. Mine is DCT and drivers package SA said they enabled launch and top speed when it was serviced.

No difference at all, still good though :-)\n\nRoads dried enough here to do some good WOT pulls, at long last, to establish a good \"butt memory\" I can compare with the pulls I do after the Dinan kit goes in this next week.Car pulls very nicely in 2nd and 3rd.

In addition to swapping out the plates, they actually have the ability to back them away from the rotor a bit more, and they do that as well, to ensure that if rocks get in there they fall out easier.I would be very surprised if your week 42 had the new plates, based on this.Also, my tech said he had no reservations based on cost to make the change--said his dealership was paid by BMW for warranty claims like this, and as far as he was concerned, he was happy to do this swap \"every day,\" if it is called for.Did you tell your SA the BMW measure number for the procedure?\n\nIf you dont go WoT you won't experience the torque overboost effect, will you?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bygramzwhat week was yours produced? i was week 42, went in for my 1200 mile service last week, and experienced the \"can crunch\" noise a lot, as people have posted here on the forums.Showed my SA the part numbers and all that to have the backing plates replaced but the tech claimed I already had the updated ones.

I'm guessing you're in the USA, so your car won't have a sunroof. There aren't exactly a lot of replaceable parts in a fixed roof.If it's the spot weld issue, the repair for that doesn't require any new parts. However, they do have to remove and replace the headliner, and doing so without damaging it is tricky.\n\nAnother update, the part has been delayed again making it 14 days delayed and counting. At this point the dealership has had the car in its possession longer than I have. When I spoke to the service person on the phone they did not have an updated delivery date as of yet.After asking again for more detailed information about the repair I was told that they were going to replace the ENTIRE roof, which is a more invasive repair than I originally thought. This is the first car I've owned so I'm not too sure what the protocol is here. Honestly I'm beyond frustrated at this point, they'll have had the car in their possession for 30 days soon, and California's Lemon Law starts to kick in (from what I've read). Some folks say I should email BMW directly, others say I should wait and see what the car is like after the repair, what do you all think I should do?\n\nMe personally, I'd buy a carbon roof panel and ask them to just install that instead. Or work something out for them to buy the panel.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byRamon.Me personally, I'd buy a carbon roof panel and ask them to just install that instead. Or work something out for them to buy the panel.Seriously? If you found out your brand-new car had a bunch of bad welds, you wouldn't be concerned about other possible body integrity issues?OP, I suggest you contact BMW NA directly. The M2 is very important to their image, it's had justifiably great reviews, and they probably want to keep it that way.\n\nBTW, OP, I hope they've arranged for alternate transportation, e.g. a loaner.\n\nI'd have BMW NA on the phone yesterday, unacceptable, period. Shoulda been waiting for a new M2, pray you dont have water leaks now. Very sorry to hear about this.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byajvdhBTW, OP, I hope they've arranged for alternate transportation, e.g. a loaner.They have, I've been driving around an entry level 330i for the past month.Happy New Year's everyone! I've got an update:I took you guys' advice and contacted BMW NA, I've been assigned a Case Manager who's going to look into it for me and see what compensation options there are? I unfortunately missed their call today due to a lunch meeting and am awaiting their call back.I emailed the Service Manager yesterday to see if there were any updates and her response was that they contacted BMW Technical Parts Group and are awaiting a response. She asked me if I would like to get a new loaner. I was completely fed up after reading that and responded saying that this is completely unacceptable and that I will be speaking to BMW NA directly about the situation.Today she calls me and lets me know the the replacement roof has arrived and that my car is already at the body shop.With that being said, I should be getting my car back by the end of this week if not the beginning of next week.\n\nUpdate:Still don't have the vehicle in my possession. I inquired about the vehicle 2 days after I was told it was sent to the body shop and the 2-3 days I was originally quoted for the turn around time at the body shop when all this started suddenly turned into 2.5 weeks. I'm supposed to get the car this week will circle back then, suffice it to say my patience is running thin.\n\nSorry for lack of updates. It ended up taking the dealership about 3 weeks to get it back to me after they delivered it to the bodyshop. I finally got my car back after 7 weeks - with a punctured rear tire no less. The low air pressure warning light came on about 30 min after driving the car. I stupidly figured it was just a random warning so I put air in the tire and went about the rest of my day. By the time I realized the tire had a puncture I had had the car in my possesion for about 3 days and had no real hope of convincing the dealership that it was their fault. So that was another $400 down the drain to get it fixed. I'm talking to BMW now to see what my options are. It's pretty clear that this is a lemon\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byskyline_m2Sorry for lack of updates.

I'd also try to avoid lemon law, but let BMW know you'd go that route if necessary.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byajvdhSounds to me like you have a good case for a buyback, but I'm not an expert.

This statement sounds weird to me.a 0w is for -20c. unless you live in a climate that sees -20c on a daily basis, its not necessary.I have heard this statement hundreds of times, that 0w40 is the same as 5w40 at operating temperature. there is no magical chemistry at play here, physically THINNER oil cannot provide the same bearing protection as a physically THICKER 5W. 0w oils shear quicker, this is a proven fact. in my owner manual is says that 5w30/5w40 is suitable for all weather conditions why would one use anything else?a 5w will fill your bearings better and stand up to high temperatures more effectively. I have tried both and the 5w not only runs at lower temperatures, but quiets your drivetrain both at operating temps AND warm starts.the 0w nonsense is a myth started by the north american CAFE requirements in a desperate attempt to see 0.2MPG fuel economy gains per car.do you live in a climate that constantly sees -20c temperatures? most likely not. so why use a 0w? even russia with their frigid temperatures still spec a 5w30 for all of their cars.on a side note, I have just switched to shell rotella t6 for my N52 engine and this stuff is incredible for a 5w40 on cold starts. I was getting lots of HVA tick and valve clatter on cold start with the previous castrol and all of it is GONE. never going back to castrol again.if you are currently using 0w40, note how your idle sounds with the hood up on cold starts, and at full operating temp. if you decide to switch to 5w40 (which is what the damn manufacturer recommends) compare idles again and see the difference.\n\nAfter exhaustive research :Motul 8100 X-cess 5W40 Synthetic Motor Oil - 5 LitersType: 238241 / 5W-40 100% Fully SyntheticApplication: Motor oil for modern gas and diesel enginesSpecifications: API SN/CF ACEA A3/B4OEM Approvals: MB 229.5 (also AMG Approved), BMW LL-01, Porsche A40, VW / Audi 502 00 / 505 00, and GM LL-B-025Volume: 5 Liters / Case = (4) 5 Liter Bottles.Motul 8100 X-cess 5W-40 100% synthetic lubricant is especially designed for powerful and newer vehicles with large displacement engines. 8100 X-Cess 5W-40 is a product that features numerous car maker approvals.

    "title": "First run in service for 6-MT",
    "content": "Hi allPlanning to bring my m2 for its first run in service.It'll be in early, ie 1100 miles as opposed to 1200.  Dealership said it's fine.I'd like to know what will be carried out for the 6 speed manual?Would be good to know which oils and if any unlocking of performance features for the manual transmission would be handy!Thanks.\n\nDealer got back:The running in service consist of an oil and filter change using BMW approved shell 0w 30 oil.Rear differential oil is replaced with BMW part number oil.Running in mode is also deactivated that could change rev range but unsure of any performance enhancement.Transmission fluid change not included for 6MT. As lifetime oil was used.\n\nHave you ever considered that the normal operating temp on an N55 / N55 Variant is on average 228-238F pending on outside air temps and driving style.  (My observations on my N55).Oil viscosity temps are taken at 100C or 212 F.    So at 212 F the oil (30wt) is up to 12.5cst thick (max for any 30wt oil)  however, your car sees 228 - 238 F just driving around town on a 50F day.    Now that same oil at 230 F --  gets almost as thin as a 20wt oil and at 240F (summer driving) the oil has a hard time providing the film and bearing strength to keep your car protected.   Plus you have a car that is Direct Injected where fuel dilution can further lower the viscosity..So - for winter the 0W-30 may be the right oil -- but a 40WT just may be the better choice for summer.   I am thinking 0W-40 or 5W-40 year around depending on where you live unless fuel economy is a top criteria.A 12cst thick oil at operating temp is optimal for the N55 and it is interesting that at 230F a 40Wt oil (on average) runs a viscosity of 12cst.Cheers,\n\nI will be tracking my M2 so at least a 40 WT oil. I also track a Corvette C7 and GM recommends Mobil 1 15-50 for track use. Does BMW actually recommend a specific oil for track days?\n\nIs it worth paying extra to change the transmission fluid? As its not covered.\n\nBMW highly recommend youdo notchange the transmission oil on the DCT. Due to the way they work there is a very real risk of a short fill.As for the manual it's personal preference. BMW/MINI are on a crusade to reduce the amount of services a vehicle needs in its lifetime/100k miles. It's in their interest to convince you of the idea of 'lifetime' oils. As such they will never cover lifetime items under warranty or service plans.That said, I've build more than a few engines and gearboxes and I do not believe in such mystical things as service free gearbox/fuel filter/engine oil.It's entirely your call but my dealer charged me £48 for the gearbox oil - but I missed a gear change while being a little to enthusiasticWho wants small pieces of metal in their gearbox oils for 100k miles?I drive my cars HARD so change my fluids every 8k rather than the 16k on the service plan. If you've only going to keep it three years rag the fuck out of it, do hard pulls and let the other guy worry about it post warranty. If you have even the slightest inclination to keep it my vote is to look after it.\n\nWord of warning to DCT owners and MT owners.I don't suggest you adhere to the BS of \"lifetime\" fluids. I had an E46 automatic that also had a \"lifetime\" transmission fluid. At around 90k miles, sure enough the valve body went out (I couldnt go into reverse gear, made parking very interesting), shops were quoting $2500 for the repair. Luckily I found a shop in Florida that rebuilt the valve bodies for $600 + your core. I did the repair myself, it was pretty easy.Moral of this story is I'll be changing my transmission fluids around 50k miles on my own dime. If you think it is a difficult procedure, I'd suggest you pay the dealership to do it.\n\nI think the guy who writes Tech Talk for Roundel, and the guy who used to write for Bimmer, say that \"lifetime fill\" is bs.  I pay no attention to BMW recommendations for long change intervals.  The worst I am doing is dropping a little unnecessary dough.  The best is far better than that.\n\nI plan to get transmission oil changed on my MT at the 1200 mile service. Should I tell them not to reset the service interval after completion?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byCommitConfirmBMW highly recommend youdo notchange the transmission oil on the DCT. Due to the way they work there is a very real risk of a short fill.Can you expand on this a bit? I have a E70X5 that I should have changed and now at 108K, I'm more afraid of a problem resulting from the change.On the M2, I plan to have the DCT serviced every ~50K.",

I hate how my cars have stuff like brake fluid swaps and state inspection added in them and more importantly they are scheduled in the computer separately from oil and brake changes.I don't need to go to the dealer for a state inspection.I asked my dealer to  clear out all the conditioned based alerts on my M.  When my pads are low based on actual sensors, I'll start getting worried about changing pads .. not just because it thinks I've been driving (too) hard.\n\nI did my 1200 mile service on my previous M3 at 900 miles.  Wasn't my choice though.  Car got delivered from my ED trip and dealer serviced it when it arrived.Nothing happened. Everything was okay.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer the break in sooner rather than later. Majority of the wear happens very early.\n\nEarlier is better.  In fact, most engine and trans builders say you should change the fluid even earlier because of the metal shavings that happen in the first 20 or so miles.The 1,200 miles has been around for a while - IMO it is a number based on the  \"we don't want them to have to go home and turn around\"  combined with \"let them figure out the car\" to the \"let the brakes set\" to a million other things (and of note, the diff fluid is supposedly different from the factory than what they change it out to).Long story short, I personally would have taken them up on that early service.\n\nHere is an informative video of a break in service in a M4 at 900 miles.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byfun2drvWent to the dealer this morning to get the CF diffuser installed.

So... does the M3/M4 engine computer enforce it?\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypruettfanService advisors really don't know much so I ignore them and do what the factory says.  1200 miles isn't a random number, I am sure it was based on some engineering analysis so sticking with 1200 miles and the other break in procedures is good sense.I totally agree. The guys that know the engine best come up with that figure. Stick with it!\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bydoug_999I have never seen a \"rev limit\" or anything set on a BMW.

Tell us, your apparently the expert here.Somebody has a case of the MondaysLook, I'll try to simplify for you (and maybe even clarify my comment)There is nothing \"magical\" about 1,200 miles.  If there was, all car manufacturers would be right about there.  But nooooo - they aren't.In fact, from what I can tell (not spending my whole day searching for you, I mean I love you and all and you are always so nice to me but I have my limits), Porsche and MB/AMG don't even do an early break-in service (someone let me know if you see otherwise).And as we know, BMW only does it on the M cars and has has the 1,200 mile timing for as long as I can remember (hmmm, they actually might have had it on regular cars way back when too?  Should have saved my 1995 manual for my 325).And... short of the rear diff, there is nothing really different about the M2 than a non M car in terms of engine and trans - there was no early service on the DCT for the 135is was there? (seriously asking).Now, we also know that most engine builders (experts if you will) say to change the oil/diff/trans fluid - FAST.  And.. we also know they often say do it more than once.Of course we are dealing with a consumer product - and you and I are not going to be going back and forth to the dealer like crazy in the first few hundred miles - and heck, our car is under warranty so not really our problem is something goes boom in the first couple of years.  So somewhere along the line, BMW came up with 1,200 miles.And no, they didn't throw a dart on a wall - I'm sure there were reasons behind it (see above... ahem).  But it is not some magical number - it can't be.  Because it would have changed over the years as tolerances increased and technology changed.  But it hasn't.  Think marketing has something to do with that?  I bet it does - can you imagine how this board would light up if that interval suddenly changed?  Heck, I remember when they were not changing the trans (wait, diff?  crap, can't remember that far back) on the 1Ms at 1,200 miles and people were going CRAZY!There - I think I've made some good points, you may or may not agree.  That's totally fine, but you could try to be just a \"touch\" nicer if you respond\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bypruettfanMost of the made up information here seems to come from you.

Why would Porsche have anything to do with a BMW break-in.  If 700 is fine what about 70 miles?  Tell us, your apparently the expert here.It's actually best to change the engine oil under 100 miles right after most of the wear occurs and the rings seat, then again at the actual break in period. There is nothing special about BMW, Porsche, etc.... engines for break in. It's the same on any engine.The break-in mileage for BMW M cars is specifically for the rear diff. The gears have to undergo a work hardening process that can only be done under driving loads. This is usually standard for any kind of gear set and usually takes at 500 miles at a minimum but possibly more depending on load and the type of gear, quality rating, etc...\n\nAn oil analysis (Blackstone Labs) could definitively determine metal content at any number of miles.Presumably, if you were only going to do a single \"break in\" oil change, it'd be done after particle contribution rate had \"significantly\" diminished - perhaps to no more than 5-10%. Otherwise, the process could continue at a significant rate after the premature service - and you'd be driving  with grindy bits flowing through your engine for 10-12K miles longer than necessary.Even if the car was drivin very hard from the start (against advice of BMW), it's not clear that the oil at the first 100mi would even containmostof the potential break-in particles.",

It is an entirely new issue. According to them, all the MY16's will need to have these replaced and some MY17's.The issue seems to be way more serious than the rear diff, as per the highlighted paragraphs.Also note the noise from rear axle description, which seems to be what a lot of folks are hearing, but I'm not sure it if it is the \"soda can crunch\" or not. I myself have not experienced it.This is the second time in the 3 months I've owned the car that it has to go in for a recall, very disappointing coming from BMW.\n\nI brought my car in for the 10,000 mile service this morning and the women helping me mentioned the bolts and that I could bring my car in whenever, she then went to grab something and came back and told me that they already ordered them for me and I need to bring the car in right when they arrive.

    "title": "Maintenance before winter storage",
    "content": "The only time I have had my vehicle in for service was after the 1200 break-in period.  I am planning on storing my vehicle for the winter around December 1, so I made an appt. for this week to have the car serviced again (I'm at 7,500 miles).  I'm not due for any specific service but I thought it made sense to get the car looked at before I put it away for a few months.  The service center just called me and basically told me that there is nothing to do since I am not due for any service.  Am I OK going without any service before I store the car?  (Storage will just be a non-heated garage and I may still drive on nice days this winter.)The only minor issues I have had are the tire pressure on my rear passenger tire (which I unfortunately had to replace after like 2 weeks because I got a flat; I have just filled it back up when low and it has been fine for a few weeks at a time but it seems like could be a slow leak?) and an intermittent message that pops up about automatic high beams not functioning correctly (I have never noticed any actual issue).Any thoughts would be appreciated.Thanks.\n\nIt's probably better to change the oil after storage. All the particles will sediment in the oil tank and will pass via the filter. A new oil/filter change will be better in the spring and you will use the oil (oil has a life limit as it oxides).Hope it helps!\n\nMakes sense.  Thanks for the reply.\n\nYou'll be fine changing the oil in the spring.  If it's going to be sitting awhile, throw some Startron in a full tank of gas and over inflate you tires.  If the rear tire is leaking air, have your tire shop remount it.\n\nWith conventional oils the recommendation for storage was always to change the oil before because byproducts of combustion would bind to the oil which could lead to damage.  One of the advantages of synthetic oils are that those particles don't bind to synthetic so I don't think its as much of a concern as back in the old days.",

I just posted in another thread that my BMW Assist isn't working and the car is going to the dealer tomorrow for that.More concerning to me, and possibly related but likely not, I'm also having a couple of weird electrical issues. First I noticed last night that after I shut off the car and locked it, all of the interior lights go out, except the hazard button, start/stop button, and headlight switch all stayed illuminated. The hazard button turned off within a minute or two, but the others stayed on longer. They turned off eventually but I don't know how long it took - I got tired of waiting. That's recurred every time I've shut down since.Second, this morning my turn signals started acting like a bulb was out. Flip on the signal and it's normal for several seconds, then the rear signal goes out and the others go into the double-time flash. The weird thing (to me anyway) is that this happened on BOTH sides of the car. Maybe a faulty switch? I have to admit that once I checked the rear signals and they went out I didn't check the fronts. The mirror indicators were still lighting up.Frankly I'm pretty terrified that I'm already having seemingly unrelated electrical issues on a brand new car - I've had it for 5 days. I plan on keeping this car for a long time, and the last thing I want is to be constantly chasing gremlins. The dealer will also be checking this out tomorrow but was curious if anyone had any thoughts or similar experiences.",

Surely the cat can restricted.ThanksIt used to be possible to retrofit the speed limiter delete on other ///M cars.  BMW promoted it in the past (and it included sometimes the madatory install of a CF trunk spoiler too).  But I believe to have heard that a retrofit ain't possible anymore with nowadays ///M cars.  It's a feature that's pre-installed at the factory.  Dealer gets a unique electronic key which he uses during the 1200 mls/2000 km maintenance to unlock the feature.  As soon as the key is used, it's logged straightaway onto the BMW HQ system (using a false key either won't work or get you in trouble).  Someone familiar with coding told that it has become too complicated nowadays to hack it.  BMW protects it better.To know if your car features the factory pre-install, check your car docs: if these indicate \"270\" (km/h) or \"168\" (mph) as top speed, your car got it.  Otherwise \"250\" (km/h) or \"155\" (mph) is indicated.  It's also indicated as option \"7ME M Driver Package\" if you decode the VIN of the car.  If it ain't indicated, it doesn't feature the factory pre-install.Maybe BMW allows a retrofit in the future for the M2.  Time will tell.With the M2 the M Driver's Package does not include the CF trunk spoiler.  But I got it installed too: if it helps even a little bit with downforce on the Autobahn at very high speed, it's worth it.",

    "content": "So my car has 8.200km, and I just got this warning message.I did break-in service around 2000km/1200 miles, and almost after 6k km it begs for more oil.In general I think that it would be great if people would post the millage from your previous service, and when/if you get this error message when you simply had to add up 1 liter/quarter of oil.Now, the part that confuses me the most, is that I dont know which oil they actually put into my car....Nobody at that Italian dealership didn't know to speak English, and the service adviser at that dealership pointed me at the paper that they will put in 5w30 oil, but at their final invoice, I was quoted for BMW TwinPower Turbo LL04 0w30 instead 5w30 that he promised.I really didn't care too much as I hopped that I wouldn't need to add any extra oil until my next service, but now as N55 seems to be Oil thirsty beast, I dont want to gamble and I will simple do the whole oil change just to be safe....Now the main question which I'm sure that bothers many people is which oil is the best for their M2, and what's the general benefits from different viscosity.My friend mechanic recommended me to whatever it was in, I should stick with 0w30. Ok but what's difference between LL01 or LL04?!?Now, my local dealer recommends 5w30, but I'm considering to either continue with 0w30 or go with that new BMW Oil that they recommend for M2 which 0w40 !?What are general benefits and cons between these too, and if someone switched from 0w30 to 0w40 what's your experience so far?Thanks everyone!\n\nI just put 1l in at 7502miles miles\n\nQuote:Originally Posted bykiysersosaeI just put 1l in at 7502miles milesI think he (OP) wants to know what weight oil.

I used 5w 30 in 1m but I had to replace every 1500miles. With Mobil 1 driven the same way, including a track session for 2hrs,  it's not lost a drop.  I've yet to drive the m2 long distance, track and road but all my cars run Mobil 0w 40, which everyone says is almost like a 0w  30, and I've had no issues.",

I know that it has to be done before a certain mileage, otherwise its best not to touch the transmission fluid once you get into higher miles.\n\nGezz guys, M5/M6 are DCT only that's why transmission is changed while for M2/3/4 Manual's only differential and engine oil is replaced.\n\nIf you are keeping the car, do it. Gear oil is inexpensive, just drain and fill.\n\nJust got my m2 yesterday, the dealership told me to have a service after the 2000km mark. They said that every M cars have to do this, they will probably activate the launch control system as well, and maybe an oil change.\n\nI just had my 2k service done last this past Monday, it is oil change, diff fluid, and they take it out of break in mode and activate all other features",

One can look up service bulletins , recalls and safety notices on all vehicles at nhtsa.gov and one can also report issues that they are having with a vehicle.  Once enough reports are received, nhtsa will investigate the issue.  Nhtsa may force the manufacturer at that point to issue a recall or bulletin or update to the product.",

    "title": "Breaking in (not smashing windows) / maintenance / coding (who will do it?)",
    "content": "My M2 wont arrive until the end of September, but Im beginning to think about what I need to do to break it in properly, maintenance after the break-in period, and some coding I definitely want to get done as soon as possible like getting that damn ASD (active sound design  that stupid cabin exhaust noise enhancement) turned off.  Anyway, some of you already have your cars so you already have or will soon be dealing with these issues.  I, for one, would like advice about:(1) driving limits for break in period (1200 miles)  Im old school so I was taught to keep the revs down and dont drive long distances at the same RPM (like a 500 mile road trip at 80 MPH on cruise control). What do others do to safely break in their M car?(2) maintenance  I know that the dealer changes the engine oil & filter at 1200 miles and there are regularly scheduled (but the consensus is, too infrequent) oil changes under the maintenance program, but I also have heard that M maintenance intervals for fluids, spark plugs, and possibly other things are different from other models. Should we simply assume that the same advice for the new M3 / M4 applies to the M2?http://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1007985With my 135is, I followed Mike Millers old school maintenance advice,http://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1197431but it doesnt deal much with M cars.So, what is your collective advice about maintenance for the M2?  I know that is a loaded question because some will think just do what BMW recommends and others will believe (as I do) that factory-recommended maintenance intervals are underwhelming.  I think opinions across that spectrum will still be helpful to the rest of us who are new to M ownership.(3) There are already some terrific posts here and elsewhere about coding, how to do it and what functions some of you have already had recoded.http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho...ghlight=codinghttp://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/sho...d.php?t=631884What isnt in those posts and Id like to know is - who is able and willing to do coding on others cars?  Im a techno-dinosaur, so Im not even going to try coding my car myself.  Ive read somewhere about having the car recoded remotely (???), but that sounds risky to me because if something goes wrong while the car is being recoded well, Id rather drive my car to someone reasonably close by and happy to pay to have it done by someone who is willing and able to do it.
