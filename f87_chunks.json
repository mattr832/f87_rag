    "text": "of that is getting pumped around the engine - it's all being safely collected in the sump.HTHNo not the engine oil, the diff and transmission oil even with standard driving those \"lifetime\" fluids still degrade and become contaminated.In regards to the engine oil you'll see increased fuel content from the combustion process and small bits of fuel making it past the piston rings which will degrade oil. Heat cycling to 270*F will degrade your synthetic oil.You do whatever you want, but if you take a look at every performance shop analyzing why bmws break down so much more frequently compared to other brands it is attributed to infrequent maintenance such as oil changes, fluid swaps, and using crappy parts like chinese oil filter elements.\n\nThey are still fully synthetic and not subject to contamination by combustion products so won't degrade at a significant rate. If you're subjecting the transmission to heavy use you want the fluid to trap the wear products and hence it's a good idea to change the fluid more frequently.But otherwise in normal use they are good for more than the 2 years of a non Life Time Fill fluid.As I mentioned elsewhere, I changed the Life Time Fill fluid on my superannuated E46 at 150k miles and it made a significant difference to shift quality (the colour of the stuff that came out was soot black), but it was still working - and continues to do so some 5 years and 30k miles later using just regular MTF fluid changed every couple of years.Once more, HTH.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byDanGDiff and transmission fluids are considered lifetime fluids.

I will also go over the particular use cases and benefits of this jack stand and why I think they make this jack stand one of the best if not the best jack stands on the market. I will also compare these jack stands to other alternatives like ramps and the quick jacks, and contrast and compare the pros and cons of these alternatives. I will also go over the BMW Jack pad adapter for the Rennstands as well.So if you are interested in purchasing the Rennstands heres are some links to do so:Rennstand:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ece-p252276669BMW Jack Pad adapter:https://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p255054561Disclaimer:Damage/Injury Disclaimer: Any information, guidance, technical advice, coding advice, tuning advice, datalogging advice, installation instruction, calculation, experiment, safety information, or product installation demonstrated in my reviews is to be consumed/",

In fact I actually I am actually using these Rennstands to install all of my mods and do all of my services in 2024, and I likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.What Are Rennstands, and who makes them?:So lets begin by discussing what are Rennstands? The best answer to that revolves around Rennstands own motto: One Jack, One Jack Point, Rennstand - essentially Rennstands are jack stands that can be disassembled and used to lift a car at a specific jacking point, then once the car is lifted the Rennstand can be reassembled and left there while the jack is removed. The end result is a jack stand that can support the car right at the point it is lifted from - meaning you no longer have to jack the car up at the jacking point and look for a suitable place on the chassis to leave a jack stand (not always suitable on cars with alot of underbody panels - such as BMWs). This is also the most optimal and ideal place to put a jack stand, since vehicles are technically only meant to be lifted and supported at the jacking point - and manufacturers did not intend to have the car lifted by a jack and supported elsewhere by a jack stand. Manufacturers only really intended for cars to be worked on via post based lifts (the stuff you would find in a shop) which lifts and supports the car right at the jacking point, and thus the Rennstands are really the only jack stands on the market that can fulfill this requirement (every other jack stand requires you to jack on the jacking point and shove the jack stand somewhere on the frame).Heres a video briefly going",

His goal was also to make the Rennstands light weight, extremely compact, easily transportable, height adjustable and low profile to fit under really low cars. After creating this initial design, Frank had his design rigorously tested by an engineer at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University for strength and durability. After the designs were tested he was able to obtain patents protecting the design.Now fast forward to production and these patents were licensed out to various vendors to facilitate production and sale of the Rennstand and thats why you may have seen several different vendors selling the Rennstand. Initially they were made by safe jack - but they are no longer selling or making the Rennstand, now Rennstand Inc (I think this is Franks company - but I am not sure) is currently manufacturing (made in the USA) and selling the original design of the Rennstand along with ETA MFG who are manufacturing (made in China) and selling what they call Rennstand 2.0 (under licensing from Frank) which is a modified version of the Rennstand (and",

So that basically sums up the history of the Rennstand and who is authorized to sell a legit version of the Rennstand (currently it is ETA MFG with Rennstand 2.0 and Rennstand Inc with the original Rennstand) - that has been engineered and tested to be safe, unlike any knock offs you may find online.If you want to see some sources here are the links:Heres Franks initial thread:https://rennlist.com/forums/993-foru...-new-idea.htmlHeres Franks first intro thread :https://rennlist.com/forums/987-foru...che-owner.htmlHeres ETA MFGs thread talking about Rennstand 2.0:https://www.etamfg.com/rennstand-ii.htmlAlso I wanted to include a small excerpt about who ETA MFG are - because if you judge them by their website and not go in depth reading about them you may not get the full picture of exactly who these people are and might not feel reassured buying their products (I have heard people say who are these guys, why buy the Rennstand from them they didnt even design it so why trust them to make it etc).

Now I have nothing against traditional jack stands, they serve their purpose well and are very safe for use on vehicles with large tubular frames or pinch welds that can be used to support the weight of a vehicle. Plus they are cheap, easy to use, portable and easy to store since they are so small. However on modern day BMWs I personally think jack stands with the claw style saddle are absolutely horrible - and lets talk about why.Credit: KC Designhttps://www.tw-kcdesign.com/upload/i...3%E5%9C%96.jpgThe first issue is placement (as you can see above this is an underbody image of the F87 M2 (representative of the F8X Chassis) and the F2X M235i (representative of the F2X and F3X chassis)):On the rear of the F8X chassis you could put the jack stands on the rear subframe, but there arent any good areas at the front of the car given you use the jacking points to lift the car.

You obviously cant put jack stands on the suspension arms (tension arm, lower control arm, thrust arm) as they arent made to take weight and you risk damaging them. You cant put jack stands on the stiffening plate as that might need to be removed and its a weird flat shape which isnt a super good place to put a claw style jack stand (or you might have to remove the plate entirely for servicing), and obviously you cant put it on the floor panels as itll punch straight through and damage the sheet metal underneath. So there really isnt any good place to put jack stands on the F8X except the rear subframe. On the F22 since the rear subframe isnt as aggressive as on the F8X it becomes even more difficult to place jack stands.Credit: .Slughttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1854652The next issue is with the claw style design:Now if you wanted to place the jack stands on the jacking points youd need a flat top jack stand like ESCO in conjunction with aluminum jack pad adapters, because placing traditional claw style jack stands under the plastic jacking points will cause them to break over time - plus the plastic was not meant to bear weight so you also risk the car collapsing if the plastic fails. Traditional claw style jack stands also dont have a large enough surface area to hold a jack pad adapter in a stable configuration, so you risk it slipping off if you try to stack a jack pad adapter onto the claw.Credit: chiefsubjugatorhttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...6&postcount=32The final issue is choosing a location",

On an F8X vehicle you can jack the front up via the front center jack point without issue, but the rear must be jacked up using the rear subframe. Now this poses a bit of risk because the central part of the rear subframe is extremely close to the differential meaning only a small part of the jacks saddle can make contact with the subframe so it is very risky as the car can slip off the jack (as you can see in the image above). You can choose to jack from the side protrusion on the rear subframe, but that can pose instability issues as you try to lift the entire rear end of the car up while being closer to one side vs. the other.Now something I did not mention is jacking from the front center jack point is a massive pain, since the front center jack point is so deep under the car you require a special lower profile extended length jack - otherwise you will need to first jack/drive the car onto blocks of wood for additional clearance. Then the next issue is pumping the car up, since the clearance between the front bumper and the floor is so small your jack handle literally can only move inches at a time, and it takes forever to jack the car up from the front center jack point and this is a major pain to deal with.Overall the cons of jack stands revolve around placement, compatibility with the factory jacking point, and time consuming and tedious nature to",

This personally was my favorite method of working on my m2 (until the Rennstand) - due to its unparalleled stability (since the car is sitting on 4 massive contact patches and due to the fact that cars were designed to sit on their wheels for the life of the car), extreme affordability (Rhino ramps are extremely cheap), and due to their weight build and ability to be stacked - they are very easy to store. Ramps also allow for realistic suspension tuning by putting preload on the suspension - something quick jacks or jack stands cannot do. So these are all the reasons why I loved my ramps, however there are still massive flaws, so lets talk about them.The first issue is lifting the car:Most ramps are way too tall for the more sporty models of BMW to just drive up on, especially when you want all 4 wheels to go up at the same time - meaning the rear ramps have to already be underneath the car for you to drive up onto them at the same time as the front ramps. This means your only option is to jack the car up onto the ramps (the exceptions are race ramps but they are quite expensive, and for the price you might as well just buy Rennstands). Now the issue with jacking the car up onto Ramps is that you need 2 jacks - one for each side of the car so you can raise the car onto the ramps in a level manner. This is a massively time consuming process as you have to pump one side of",

    "text": "the car up onto Ramps is that you need 2 jacks - one for each side of the car so you can raise the car onto the ramps in a level manner. This is a massively time consuming process as you have to pump one side of the car up little by little to ensure it doesnt flip, and if one of your jacks are too short (like mine is in the image above) you need to prop it up on 2 by fours and move all that wood to the next wheel along with your jack. It is also extremely risky and dangerous, because the front wheels on RWD BMWs do not have any parking brakes. This means when you have to jack the rear of the car up on ramps first as you can still chock the front wheels while theyre on the ground, and the rear wheels are safe to be on the ramps first as they have parking brakes. Then you have to carefully jack the front wheels up on ramps afterwards. To make this process safer you should get a brake pedal depressor tool like I have. But this is still extremely tedious and time consuming.The second issue is you cant do anything that requires the wheels to be off:This means if you need to do brake jobs, wheel rotations etc. Your ramps are completely and utterly useless - which is why I wanted to upgrade to Rennstands for my primary mode of supporting the car, and have the ramps for suspension tuning.The final issue is adjustability:The final issue with ramps is the lack of adjustability, ramps are one height and thats it. You cant go lower and you cant go higher, and that is an annoyance if you want to work in the engine bay while it is on ramps. It becomes a bit of a challenge to reach deep down into the engine bay when the car is high up.So these are the reasons why ramps are not completely ideal for",

These are very very nice pieces of equipment, they allow for the car to be lifted via the press of a button - so no more pumping up jacks. They lift front and rear and left and right simultaneously so it is one and done, no need to worry about the front and then the rear and vice versa. The quick jacks also allow for a 24 lift height which surpasses all jack stands and ramps by quite a big margin iirc. But there are always drawbacks to everything, so lets talk about it.The first issue is price:Quick jacks are insanely expensive, they retail for $1500 USD + (and that's for the cheapest model). For that price you can buy ~3 sets of Rennstands, ~15 pairs for Rhino ramps, and ~30+ pairs of conventional jack stands. So it is not cheap and thats always a huge drawback for a lot of people, since it becomes a money issue. Now before I hear you own a BMW you should be able to afford quick jacks, dont forget these cars are rapidly becoming older and more accessible to more and more people, so money is always going to become a factor eventually. Plus its a BMW, theyre relatively affordable for sports car sake.The second issue is Size:Quick jacks are quite large at 60 +, and quite heavy at 60 lbs + for the frame itself and 15 lbs for the motor",

So this makes portability and setup a concern, so if you have a small garage or a space constrained garage storing these quick jacks and setting them up and taking them down to store some place else might become tiresome as they are heavy and bulky. This is one of the main restricting factor for myself, since my garage is full of stuff and I dont have room for quick jacks (I have 3 cars in my garage, bikes, a lawn mower, snow blower, leaf blower, tools, air compressor, etc - so unfortunately there is no room for quick jacks in my garage). This is an even larger issue if you live in a house without a garage (apartment, condo, townhouse etc) and you cant constantly carry the quick jack into and out of your house. For most people the size and weight are deal breakers, and this unfortunately is my issue.The Final issue is maintenance:Like with most hydraulic power tools you have to maintain them to ensure they work properly. You have to ensure that the quick jack frames stay clean, you have to ensure the hoses and quick disconnect fittings stay clean, and you always have to watch for leaks and inspect the locking system. You also have to bleed the system occasionally.So this is a minor hassle that must be dealt with, and doesnt make the quick jack a true set it and forget it system (unlike mechanical systems like ramps or jack stands) and this might be annoying to some.Rennstands:Now onto my discussion of the Rennstands.Unboxing:First let's start off with the unboxing so you guys will have an idea of what you are going",

The ETA MFG box itself was also double boxed and contained within the outer USPS box.ETA MFG also have duty free shipping to Canada and the USA so if you are in those locations, you will be glad to hear it will arrive to you without the worry of paying duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (and take it from me a guy who buys a lot of stuff from the US, brokerage fees from UPS often cost 2-3x as much as the shipping itself and that really sucks). My package was also shipped via Canada post, and arrived to me in ~4 business days, which is absolutely excellent, and the package arrived as if it were brand new so shipping was good and packaging was excellent.Credit: F87SourceThe next image shows the Rennstand box opened up, you will notice it is packaged excellently - I cant even begin to describe how good this packaging was - it must be the best packaged item I have ever purchased in terms of car parts.

Next each item in the box was individually bagged, and parts that would touch were covered in cardboard, there was also a wooden divider separating the solid metal kegs from the rest of the box to prevent damage. Loose items like the pins were put in a bag (the pin one to the right of the image) and wrapped with foam and then tied down. Also critical voids in the box were filled with styrofoam or cardboard, and as a result there were ZERO rattles or movement in the packaging and that meant the Rennstands arrived in essentially excellent condition.

I will talk more about these later on but they are very hefty for their size and are absolutely solid.Instructions Manual:Next I wanted to share the instructions manual for the Rennstands, because I dont think its available online and sharing it will allow anyone that wants to read it the opportunity to do so. Also, having it archived online will help anyone who has lost their instructions.View post on imgur.comTechnical Details:Now lets move onto the technical details.1) Base: The first thing I would like to talk about is the base of the Rennstands, because the stability of a jack stand comes from its base.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceIf we look into the size of the feet, my measurements have these feet at ~22.5 cm long, and the feet are ~",

    "text": "jack stand comes from its base.Credit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceCredit: F87SourceIf we look into the size of the feet, my measurements have these feet at ~22.5 cm long, and the feet are ~4.76 cm wide (as per ETA MFG). The distance between the feet is ~33.33 cm in its lowest setting but increases to ~39.6875 cm in its highest setting (as per Rennstand) - this means as the stands get higher the base gets larger which adds to its stability. These dimensions give the Rennstands a very large footprint and base, making it incredibly stable overall. In fact I tried to test the stability of these jack stands by pushing on my car quite hard (well over 100 lbs of force) and there was no sign of movement or wobbling from the Rennstands. I also tried testing stability without any load on the Rennstands and they are pretty hard to push over. Another thing to note is that the Rennstands have pretty large flat feet - meaning it is going to be more resistant to sinking in softer ground, for instance asphalt when it gets very hot. The larger feet also do a better job spreading load across a larger surface area, meaning it is less likely to crack thinner concrete garage floors. Note: it is not recommended to use jack stands on anything but hard solid level ground.Now if we compare that to a traditional jack stand like my 2 ton AC Delco, they have a base of ~16 cm X 17 cm, so significantly smaller than the Rennstand. This leads to less overall stability, and why it was easier to push over when unloaded. The traditional jack stands also have smaller, very narrow and sharp feet, which means it will be more likely to sink on softer surfaces or damage the ground it is on.So overall we can see the feet and base of the Rennstand gives it tremendous stability compared",

Its wide feet also give it the ability to resist sinking and cracking the ground it is on, as it is able to spread the load over a larger surface area.2) Height and Access: The Rennstand has a maximum lift height of ~41.95 cm, which is comparable to the ESCO shorty jack stand (~43.18 cm) and other typical jack stands (they are taller than my no name certified jack stands, but are shorter than my moto master jack stands), and they offer significantly more underbody clearance than my rhino ramps. Compared to quick jacks they fall far behind, as quick jacks offer a lift height of ~60.96 cm.So overall access to the underbody is comparable to other jack stands, is greater than traditional ramps, and is less than quick jacks. However, the one major benefit of jack stands, Rennstands, and ramps over the quick jacks is side access to the underside of the car. This allows anyone easy access to the middle of the car by crawling from the sides of the car rather than from the front or the back - which you must do when using quick jacks as the massive frames take up the entire side of the car. So if you need to do a transmission oil flush, it is much easier to access the car from the side while holding a bottle of fluid with a pump sticking out from the top, vs. trying to crawl from the front of the back. Its also much easier to perform work that requires constant access to the middle of the underbody by going through the side vs. the front or the rear - for instance a clutch delay valve delete or short",

There is no way that these legs will shear, bend, or have the pin holes fail when used under the rated weight limits. Like if you ever had the chance to hold these legs you would be able to feel how hefty and rock solid they are. They literally contribute the bulk majority of the weight to the overall Rennstand.So overall based on just the legs alone, the Rennstand 2.0 must be the strongest version of the Rennstand.4) Side Leg Removal: The ETA MFG R",

This means you have to lift the Rennstands a lot less to fit the legs in place compared to the alternate version.5) Material: The Rennstands are made from very strong carbon steel, and are electrostatically powder coated orange. This allows the Rennstands to be extremely strong, and well protected from corrosion.5) Jack Size: The Rennstands saddle has a jacking point of ~3, so you must have a corresponding floor jack with a saddle diameter of 3 or more so it can properly lift the Rennstand.6) BMW Jack Pad Adapter: The Rennstand has a variety of attachments for its saddle, one of which is a BMW specific jack pad adapter.https://www.etam",

Ive tried this specific adapter on my own M2 and it fits perfectly in the plastic jack pad, and has sufficient height to clear the sides of the adapter so it doesnt damage it. It also is tall enough to clear my rear M performance winglets - which sits right next to the plastic jacking point.7) Additional Jack Pad adapters: The Rennstands also have a variety of jack pad adapters that you can choose from. For instance they have a really cool saddle adapter:Credit: ETA MFGhttps://www.etamfg.com/shop.html?sto...ces-p251403769That should be large enough to fit aluminum jack pad adapters for BMWs, incase you would like to use your existing jack pad adapters instead of the ones ETA MFG makes. You can also use this to put hockey pucks on it for use on the front center jacking point, and so much more. So this saddle adapter really opens up new possibilities.They also have flat top adapter pad for use on subframes, and they have honda, audi, tesla and porche specific pinch weld adapters as well if you want them.8) Price: The ETA MFG version of the Rennstands are ~$149.99 on sale (i",

So its a huge benefit that IMO the best version of the Rennstand is also the cheapest.9) Portability: Finally the last thing I would like to talk about is the portability of the Rennstands, since they can be dismantled into very small components, they are very portable and easily stored anywhere. This gives it a major advantage over traditional jack stands and even the quick jack - since these Rennstands can easily fit in the floor well on the passenger side, under trunk floor liners, in the back seat floor well, and can be easily stored in very smaller areas like under the stairs.Testing:Finally I would like to talk about load testing on the Rennstands, since this is a pretty important aspect for safety. Note: Everything im going to be talking about only applies to the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand, not the other versions you may find out there.So the ETA MFG Rennstands are rated for 3 Tons per pair under the ASME/PALD certification standards, which are more rigorous than the ANSI testing rules used by the alternate Rennstands and this is also why the weight ratings are done in pairs. However, when tested in house the ETA MFG version of the Rennstands were capable of holding over 6 tons each - but legally they were only able to rate it at 3 tons per paid as thats what the lab testing under ASME/PALD yielded.So rest assured that these Rennstand",

This is extremely confidence inspiring especially since I will be using these for suspension work which requires torquing the lower control arms to ~130 ft lbs.3) Ease of use: The Rennstands were really easy to set up compared to my ramps, and literally only required a few pumps of a jack to lift the car up and get the Rennstands in place. Everything fit perfectly fine and there were no issues. Again this is a huge reason why I chose them over conventional jack stands, you jack them up right at the jacking points - no need to get fancy with where you put the jack stand, and no need to get creative with where you have to jack. So IMO the Rennstands blow away traditional jack stands and it isnt even a comparison.Note: I had to drive the front wheels up onto some 2 X 4 pieces of wood since the car was just a tiny bit low to clear the Rennstands with the floor jack I was using. Also If you use 2 floor jacks you would be able to go to max height in one go (as you would be able to lift the front all at once, and then the rear all at once), with just one floor jack you have to go one height setting at a time to not make the car tilt too much.4) Portability: These Rennstands were actually a lot larger than I initially anticipated since they have a massive base and width between their feet.

However, since you can take them apart, storing it was really easy as I could just slide them beneath my stairs in the garage. This is even better than my ramps or jack stands because when it is taken apart the sum of its components are relatively small and easy to store and can fit in all sorts of places (as you can see from the size of the box that these things come in). Obviously this is also a significantly better solution than buying quick jacks, since I simply dont have the storage space for them, nor do I want to fork over $1600 for a set.5) Wheel clearance: Most people are worried that the Rennstands will not fit their car since the foot print is quite large, however the jack point location on our BMWs are far enough away from the wheels it was not even a remote issue.Summary:Overall I must say these Rennstands are absolutely excellent, they are extremely stable, convenient, offer massive lift height, and very easy to store as they can be dismantled. The Rennstands also solve a lot of the issues that the alternative lifting methods I described earlier have. For instance they allow you to have a jack stand right where you jack up the car so you dont have to struggle for a suitable location to put a jack stand (which as I described earlier a suitable location for jack stands are very limited and sometimes not even available on modern day BMWs), they lift the car by the jacking points so you can remove the wheel unlike with ramps, and they are cheaper, significantly more portable than quick jacks (great for people with limited storage ******* and allow side access under the car which the quick jacks cannot do.

I also recommend the ETA MFG version of the Rennstand over all of the other ones on the market, simply because: they have solid legs (meaning they are stronger than the hollow leg versions), the legs connect from the side meaning you dont have to jack the car up as high to remove them compared to other versions of the Rennstand, and they are cheaper than the other versions of the Rennstand.

I know a few F8X guys have done this already, but my question was if you guys have used non oem fluids.I know the m2 requires MTF-LT-5 for the manual transmission and SAF-XJ rated fluid for the differential, and bmw has stated that an equivalent like castrol's 75W140 syntrax LSD would be ok for the diff. Has anyone used this before?Thanks--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit - 20/04/22So from the time I created this thread until now I have learned alot about differential oil on this platform and its availability. So here is a brief summary:1) You should use MSP/A if you can get it, this is what bmw stipulates to use via ista, real oem (their etk which real oem displays), and their differential recall tsb.2) I have realized that MSP/A is not available in the USA, so if you're in the US I would recommend to use SAF-XJ (not SAF-XJ + FM), the difference probably isn't huge and you should be absolutely fine with this. This might be the case in Canada as well, as I am hearing MSP/A is no longer available here. So alot of the earlier information I posted was deemed to be not fully accurate on this matter, because I was not aware MSP/A is not at all available in the USA. So if you cannot get MSP/A use SAF-XJ don't feel obligated to get it if you can't find it.3) Check your dealer invoice after the break in service, I have seem some cases where dealers are using SAF-XO fluid for the fluid change.

So please ensure you don't have this fluid as it can cause severe damage, as it isn't the proper weight and doesn't have the required friction modifiers that the clutch packs require.4) This is an iffy one, but I would stay clear of aftermarket fluids if possible. I keep seeing stories of how fragile these diffs are and failing prematurely, some due to clutch packs wearing out early, some due to SAF-XJ +FM fluids being used (E9X m3 specified diff oil) - which is scary because some aftermarket differential oils are also suitable for the e9x m3 which makes me worried that it might have too much friction modifiers for our F8X diffs. so I would probably stick with OEM fluids for now.\n\nI changed mine myself at 9,700 miles and used BMW fluid for warranty reasons.

Not sure why parts ppl told me otherwise.Your dealer is incorrect, alot of dealers are making this mistake not sure why. But when the m4 first launched dealers frequently messed up and filled the diff with saf-xj + fm which was used only for the old E series diff instead of the F series M cars. This caused premature wear and tear on the F series diff.At some point during the F series life cycle bmw ditched saf-xj for MSP/A which is now the recommended differential fluid.

Fortunately my dealer is on top of their game (unlike alot of other dealers) and this is what I got during servicing.I finally found a retailer for MSP/A in Canada that is selling it for a reasonable price so I will no longer be going with the Castrol syntrax limited slip oil.Quote:Originally Posted bydebugYa, the SAF-X",

Not sure why parts ppl told me otherwise.Your dealer is incorrect, alot of dealers are making this mistake not sure why. But when the m4 first launched dealers frequently messed up and filled the diff with saf-xj + fm which was used only for the old E series diff instead of the F series M cars. This caused premature wear and tear on the F series diff.At some point during the F series life cycle bmw ditched saf-xj for MSP/A which is now the recommended differential fluid.

Going after market maybe another option.Weird, but that's not what the bmw etk, tis, and tsb (that was released awhile back) says.Since I've seen so many dealers mess up with this simple procedure by still filling up with the saf-xj + FM fluid, I wouldn't trust them. I would trust the recommendations of bmw directly which is to run MSP/A.If you cannot get this I guess it would be a toss up between Castrol syntrax or saf-xj. What I can say is that saf-xj was used previously and I don't remember their being an issue, but Castrol syntrax is indeed recommended as a suitable replacement by bmw so it's your choice on what to use. I personally would have went with syntrax by following the tis.\n\nQuote:Originally Posted byJustinHEMIThis is what my dealer just did. Should I be concerned?Yeah you should be very worried.

Your dealer majorly messed up, looking at saf-xo it is not the correct weight at 75w90 instead of 75w140.Next is that it was made for non limited slip diffs so it does not have the correct friction modifiers to make the clutch discs slip properly without major wear and tear.

I'm lucky enough that my dealer is really competent (and they know I'm crazy OCD so they graciously take good care of me) so I don't have to worry too much, even though I still really do not like dealerships at all because I'm worried they will mess up.",
