    "content": "There have been many people who have been wondering just how good the VRSF Catless downpipe for the M2 is, so I decided to partner up with VRSF and make a review of my experience with their product.So, firstly, once I received the downpipe, I analyzed it inside and out to make sure the welds were good. All looked like really good work and the stainless steel was very solid with no imperfections.I decided to heat wrap the downpipe, as I decided not to opt for the optional ceramic coating.Installing the downpipe was very easy. With the help of a friend, I would say I got the old one out and the new one installed in less than an hour. The oxygen sensors were screwed into the threaded inserts with some copper anti-seize. Absolutely perfect fitment with the stock exhaust and turbo-side; the clamps snapped in and were tightened very nicely.As for the sound.... My god does this thing transform the car.Originally I was considering getting an aftermarket exhaust as my next mod, but I can wait quite a bit longer, as this current setup sounds amazing.Overall, I was VERY pleased with the quality of the downpipe. Welds were done great, the material is very solid, and the fitment was fantastic.I have attached some pictures of the installation as well as comparing the stock downpipe. Let me know if anyone has any questions!I will be making a Youtube video documenting stock cold start and revs vs with the catless downpipe installed and I will post the link on here once it is completed!My instagram is @Project_f87 for any of you interested in following the build.Had a great time working withTiago@VRSF!My Youtube vid of the comparison sound clips:\n\nGot a sound clip?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds very good!\n\n\n\nThank you for the review\n\nThanks for the opportunity to be part of your build Alain!\n\nI can also say that this downpipe has transformed my car.

    "content": "Hi all,Last week I bought a used HJS 300 Cell EUR6 downpipe which was used for around 5k miles. Soon after that, a bmw specialized tuner shop installed the downpipe for me.Because I was about to flash my car with BM3 Stage 1, I hooked up my car to the Bootmod3 app, read codes and saw this:Quote:180001 Catalyst: Efficiency Below ThresholdThe next day a CEL light was displayed in the dash...I cleared codes and just checked for DME errors again using BM3 and the same error entry is back.From what I had understand, the HJS 300 Euro6 cat is supposed to not trigger CEL lights, right? Could this be an installation error or something?Thanks in advance!\n\nYou would hear an exhaust leak if it were installed wrong. Not sure the O2s reach the wrong holes...\n\nSo, there was a post a while back where Fabspeed admitted that their downpipes do give CEL's (\"*to a small percentage of cars\" in their words) and corrected their statement to be \"100% guaranteed to not cause a LASTING check engine light\"The solution being to run the car with the CEL for a certain amount of time/mileage then the check engine light will go away as the car adapts. But if you keep clearing the light, the ECUs won't know to adapt, so the light will keep coming on.I know you don't have a Fabspeed downpipe, but maybe that solution will help you too... Don't clear the CEL and drive around for a few weeks.\n\nBeen running my HJS 300 cell DP for 2 months and 1500 miles now without a code.  Given that the code was thrown shortly after install would make me start looking at the O2 sensors or a leak at the DP and turbo connection.  You really should replace the gasket at this junction.Lastly, are you sure you were sold an HJS 300 cell DP?\n\nThey replaced gaskets. DP part nr checks out\n\nBizarre for sureMaybe email the company and seek advice?As others, I've had a 300 CEL DP (Akra, in my case) in for the last 30k+ miles, never had a light come on.My bet would be an install issue of some sort.\n\nJust called the shop which installed the DP. They said it's kinda hard to install it incorrectly since the O2 sensors/connectors are specific. And If it would have been an exhaust leak, I would notice that.So there're saying that my car is probably 'sensitive'. I will followAnthony1sadvice and just drive it for a few days with the CEL to see if the car adapts. Does this CEL have an impact on the car's performance?\n\n\n\nKinda sounds like you bought a cat that was used a lot already. Or abused.\n\nPrevious owner had it on his stock M2 which still have relatively low miles and I don't think it was used before that on a other car.  Would a defect be visible from the outside? Looked fine from both sides but didn't know what to look for\n\nSome of you guys are lucky to live in a state where they don't sweat emission inspection.TIL that for OBD2 state emissions testing, the cat not only has to be flowing properly but also be at the correct operating temperature before it allows a \"ready\" testing phase to commence.So any aftermarket cat can possible throw off the set stock temperature parameters.Long story short, just because a sports cat doesn't throw a 'check engine' light doesn't necessary mean you'll pass an OBD2 inspection...Nice.\n\nAs far as the OP's issue, I bet the catalyst is burn out, if there is no gasket leaks.You can't tell it's burned out by physically looking as it but process of elimination could confirm that.\n\nThe car makes quite a noise, but a guess thats expected in combination with open flap MPE. Wouldn't the car smell bad when the catalyst isn't working as expected?\n\n",

And, I can confirm like others have said that putting the car into Traction/MDM runs the Comfort mode cooling program, vs Sport/Sport+/DSC Off more aggressive cooling mode, which is stupid!I haven’t tried logs or needed to update the agent, yet; will get to that. To clarify the internet question, the agent connects to your phone WiFi hotspot, just like if you were connecting your laptop to the internet while logging, so it doesn’t impact things like Waze, Spotify, email, etc.I also changed the gauges to blue from red, and set high limit alarms for IAT, coolant, oil temps, so we’ll see what that does to catch my attention when it happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust ordered a wifi agent from Ebay.

    "content": "I took my car in for a NY state inspection today, this is the first year since the vehicle is now three model years old they had to plug in the vehicle into its OBD2 port and check the \"emissions\" compliance.However, the vehicle's computer keeps spitting that some of the emission control devices are not in a \"ready\" state, sort of like when you disable the cat with a tune but all I have installed is a Dinantronics Stage 1, everything else is stock.As far as I know, Dinan products are CARB legal, so I didn't think they interferes with any emission control device but when I disconnected the piggyback, all the sensors slowly started coming back online.:Does anyone know if Dinan piggybacks interferes with the emission control devices or do I have a 'defective' unit..\n\nHow long did you wait between resetting the ECU and having them read the car? From experience everything related to catalyst and O2 sensors takes a while to \"clear\" since the ECU is performing its own calibrations following a reset, stock or modified.In regards to Dinan piggybacks I have no experience whatsoever... but I do know that any tune above stock will decrease the lifespan of stock catalysts and eventually it will throw a code when reading the car through the OBD2.Drive the car around for a while and read your car again to see if the O2 sensor cleared.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would have tried putting the Dinan into bypass mode.\n\nHave you asked Dinan about this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to close out this thread; my vehicle passed inspection today after I removed the piggyback and reset the 'drive cycle.' Not sure if I had just bypassed the tune with the Dinan APP if this would of worked as well but I did not chance it and just completely removed the whole unit.Dinan never replied to my emailed question asking if the Dinantronics was blocking the sensors from going into a 'ready' state for inspections. When I got someone over the phone, they just directed me to a dealer.So their silence was deafening, as it pretty must answered my question.Anyaftermarket changes to these vehicles, you run the risk of the computer kicking it back.Some folks might be ok rolling the dice with tuning, in the name of more power but I'm done tinkling with my daily driven vehicles, as I can't afford to deal with any possible related issues.\n\nTuning can definitely turn into a rabbit hole. For some of my previous cars, I didn’t want to mess with it. For the M2, I’m enjoying it, as I’m learning a lot.Having moved on from Dinantronics, I can say that BM3 is smoother, faster, and more customizable. Plus, it’s just a 5min exercise to go from stock, to a tune, back to stock and lock the DME.None of this is with Apple-like ease, but it’s a good way to go if you decide you want to start tweaking again.",

So that $100 \"tip\" doesn't cut it anymore.[/QUOI assume you took this picture atidle...When the cars cold and / or idling, and even at low load it will usually switch to open loop in which the DME is controlling everything according to a preset tables (And the input of a few obvious sensors, tps, tmap)100% IGNORES PRIMARY 02...Once at Norm Operating temp, and moving it switches to closed loop and relies almost 100% on the primary 02 for short term lambda.I too use torque to determine if the cars @ NOT, i use this lolAnd the DOT installed Cameras in the early 2000s....However we used to put a box in front of it, some would smear some oil. We even had to get a dot approved 80K lod bearing dyno, and exhaust sniffers..But no OBD.  Now it NEEDS the 02 to determine if the cars running rich or lean and egt or evap or iacv are also checked... Good thing is, PTF BM3 dont alter idle parameters.... So if you clear the code and if the test is done after enetering open loop but before the Cel comes on, In theory it should pass....I will find out soon..I used to have  ASE NYS  Inspectors  Licence  when it was much different, however my stepdad who is  a career certified chevy tech, swears he uses this technique to pass catless vettes for friends all the time...\n\n[QUOTE=DKM2Power;24651614]\n\n[QUOTE=Poochie;24651700]\n\n[QUOTE=DKM2Power;24651711]",

I did some logs with the Stage 2 OTS map vs the custom map & honestly the OTS map seems a lot better..... Boost holds to redline and seems to be more consistent.

    "content": "I recently jumped on the BM3 bandwagon (great stuff so far), and I've done quite a bit of research before making deciding to ultimately pull the trigger. I thought I was pretty tech savvy and can follow directions, but trial an error is how I eventually got everything to work. (maybe I can't follow directions?)I'm running a catless downpipe, but otherwise stock in the performance department, so I went with a Stg 1 OTS tune to start me off, as it listed a FMIC & downpipe as *requirements* for Stg 2 OTS maps. Stg 1 is simply *no modification required*. Being catless, I do get the CEL, with the Stg 1 OTS map, and there doesn't seem to be a way to modify the OTS maps. I opened a ticket to inquire about a way to get a custom map simply removing the CEL function for cat efficiency and cold start delete and keeping the rest of the OTS mapping, and was told simply that the those are functions of the Stg 2 OTS maps.I'm trying to figure out my next course of action. I'm not ready to do a custom map with one of the established tuning companies because I have more plans for the car and don't want to have to do things twice, and I don't want to have to revert to stock map just to be able to modify it to fix the CEL for cat efficiency.What are my options other than full-fledged custom map or getting stuck with a stock map with cold start delete and cat efficiency CEL delete?\n\n\n\nBest option would be to get a much needed intercooler and go with stage 2 mapWith stock intercooler car is under performing even with stage 1\n\nIf this helps, I am FMIC & MPE only so far. Always running 93. Did some 4th gear pulls and a 5th gear pull and sent to Halim for review and it came back as \"look great\" I plan on a DP in the near future but from direct discussion you should be fine as long as your not going to track the car. if so then a DP is a must. FMIC is always required when raising boost levels.... believe me the health of the car overall will be better especially being in the hot and humid Fla environmentJump to the STG 2 and do logs and review...you will be fine. Always run 93 and pop in some booster if it pulls timing a little bit. Also pay attention to your IAT's. I tell you the OTS map is smooooooth\n\nYou'll be fine with Stage 2 with just a downpipe...sure you'll experience heat soak, nothing gonna blow up. If you're not hitting the track, you're fine.\n\nHello,I'm sorry for noob question, but sometimes I have to startWhat exactly you mean \"if it pulls timing\"? I mean what numbers I am looking for to recognise DME had done corrections in wot?Thanks, Roman\n\n\n\nIs a FMIC also required for stage2 in colder countries, like the Netherlands for example?\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm surprised no one before me was able to tell you this - you can turn off cat efficiency warning with STG1 map thru config tab.Don't forget to save the changes and flash again and you'll be good.\n\n\n\nWhat issues did you have with the flash install?",

For me I want my m2 to be as loud as possible (but not catless). Which one should I choose?\n\n\n\nWhich ever one YOU like the most.\n\nHas any body heard both stock and MPE, what is the difference in the metal?I really like the tone of stock, but do crave a little more noise and clearer pops\n\n\n\n\n\nMpe sounds the best in terms of the tone and crackles but seems like supersprint is the loudest.\n\nI'm about to flaunt my ignorance of exhaust systems (and cars in general.) If you have the MPE but don't want it to be particularly loud at a given time, is there a mode for that?\n\n\n\nHmm...My wife is not going to like a loud car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dealer is \"forcing\" me to get MPE. I guess it is their way of marking it up while still being able to say they are selling it at sticker.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo from the reviews, the stock M2 exhaust sounds really good.  The MPE adds bunch of cost (those tips are $$$) and so my question is, does it really soundthatmuch better?and to clarify, it adds zero hp/torque right?\n\n\n\ngo based on the looks and sound of the exhaust.\n\n\n\nBut to answer the question, I am sure all exhausts are good. It is just a question of taste/style/finish/sound.Moreover, most of us will not see the 8hp power increase \"claims\" on a 370hp car anyways... It is just marketing selling point\n\nThe MPE is just an axle back right?",

    "content": "Just received my downpipe from the good folks at Fabspeed. It took about 2 weeks from order to delivery. It came incredibly well packaged. The downpipe is beautiful from end to end. Almost a shame to hide it under the car. Install will be in the next day or two and I will try and take more pics and review the sound.....Okay. Pipe installed. 2 amateurs can do it in under an hour with a lift. Upper V-band clamp obviously tricky. We just used a punch to tap it around until it surrendered. Fit was flawless. Several extra minutes spent making sure everything was perfectly mounted. Zero leaks. Amazing sound under startup and rev range. Almost no noticeable noise difference while cruising. Five star product even if a little pricey. Thankfully we only need one. LolI have a 10 second rev video on my Iphone that turned out great. PM me a number and I'll gladly send it\n\n\n\nCongrats!!\n\nLooks nice, OP.Do you know the advertised the hp / torque gain for the dp?  Everything I've seen combines DP with other upgrades and it's impossible to tell what dp does on it's own (which is what I'm considering).  Thanks!\n\nFabspeed's dyno graph looks pretty close to my butt dyno results. It's a small but noticeable increase. Most gains felt in the low RPM range. I consider the sound improvement worth the cost alone. For me, the sound is perfect now with the pipe installed and the ASD removed. I know it's cliche, but this is how it should come from the factory\n\n\n\nCat Spec (diameter and density)? Power difference before and after? CEL?\n\n\n\n\n\nWowFabspeed Motorsportmake a DP for the X4 M40i !!!I'm local btwtrafficalertdid you Dyno before / after or drag it to see difference?\n\n\n\nI didn't dyno before/after or at all yet. I can tell you that the difference is plenty noticeable. Turbo spool is slightly more audible. Awesome burble increase around 4k rpms and on redline upshifts (DCT). I did a launch control takeoff a day or two after install and the torque increase on launch was enough to upset the traction control. Car aborted the launch and gave me a clutch warning. I haven't tried LC again since. Just brake boost and gas seems to be better anyway.\n\nAny noticeable exhaust smell going with the sport cat vs oem?\n\nZero exhaust smell. I've stuck my face right up to the pipes. That's why I went catted. Great tone, plenty performance, no downsides. About 3-400 hard miles w no check light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds awesome!\n\nI am waiting for a video of combining fabspeed sport cat with mpe. Anyone doing that ?\n\n\n\nIs the M2 emission certification level EPA or CARB?Only asking b/c of this recommendation...https://www.magnaflow.com/support/te...ght-converter/If an OBD II vehicle is built to meet CARB standards, then it requires a California certified converter. For example, one significant difference is that NYS will allow EPA (Federal) certified vehicles to use a non-CARB part whereas California does not make that distinction.Which I am reading as if the car's VECI is CARB then it isbestto use a CARB cat.I know most are installing the cat for sound but is there a concern that we could generate enough heat by tracking the car to melt the cats? Or is the M2 cat beefed up too like the coolers and oil sump?http://speed.academy/how-catalytic-converters-work/\n\n",

    "content": "Thinking about adding the Dinan big turbo but I don't run the Dinan tune as I have BM3.  Can BM3 tune take advantage of the big turbo or do you get the gains just with the bigger turbo while running stage 2 tune?  Thanks!\n\nMy Dinan/BM3 thread shows me starting with the Stg 2 tune and working with PTF to get a Stg 2H tune with more power!M-Supra has one, as well.\n\n\n\nThe only caveat to all this is my Stg 2H tune is with V5.5. I like the midrange on 5.7, so I have to send more logs to PTF to get a Stg 2H 5.7 map. Then, I’m putting on a sport cat in a cpl months and will send logs and try for a Stg 2H 5.7 V2 map.The point of me saying all this is Halim only has so much time in a day, so you have to ask nicely and not for too much custom tune stuff.Halim mentioned creating a Stg 2 Dinan turbo OTS tune, so maybe that is still coming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’d like to do a turbo upgrade, but starting with FBO and Stage 2 93 tune, it appears the stage 1 Dinan Turbo would only net around 20 peak hp..making it a fairly pricey upgrade on an installed $$/ hp basis. May be better value going straight to Stage 2.\n\n\n\nPlus you’ll introduce lag and need a fueling upgrade to extract all the extra hp of a Stage 2 turbo, unless you takeSeanWRTapproach.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuys you have to realize the fact that Halim as the BM3 master tuner is first the tuning/platform developer, then an enlisted custom tuner with BM3 platform.He's responsible for ALL the tuning with the company and has to literally hand make each single map under PTF's name for ALL BMW F and G models. There're 10k+ global customers that need to know the maps they can download from cloud sever any time are safe and performing. It's a huge responsibility to take, imagine that.Now is a critical timing for the BM3 as they're working on B58/B48 ECU, so are their competitors. Whoever enter the market first with well validated products win a huge part of market.As a young tuning professional, he probably has more map to make and test than anyone else in the BMW's game every day given BM3's popularity. And he has to prioritize his tasks.Use the OTS first please, V5.7 is pretty aggressive really. I'll say it's already stronger than the 'infamous' V5.3.I seriously doubt FBO car on normal 93OCT can handle V5.7 when ambient is above 70F.IMO, even stage one turbo can be taken full advantage of on pump gas with V5.7. I mean it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not an expert on this stuff, but I'll try to apply what I've learned from here.If you're noticing high IATs and timing pull, the first thing I'd try is 100 octane race gas or octane booster. That will help prevent timing being pulled as IATs go up. It helps for consistent power, but doesn't solve the issue of heat soak on really hot track days.If IATs are pushing into 120-130F, I'd drop to the Stage 2 91 map. That's more power than Stage 1 93, and it'll back off the timing advance and runs a richer mixture up top. I'm guessing that would be good enough on a hot track day, if you have a good IC.\n\nBeing the miserly sort, Ill dial back the tune before trying the 100 octane route.When the time comes, Ill start with the stage 2 91 per your comments and see how that does.Thanks for the input.",

Details posted by member Nine Lives:Quote:Quote:\" Just from an hour or so ago:https://www.facebook.com/TuningTechF...08860/?fref=nf331 WHP 325 WTQI believe with 93 octane and Maryland \"Which seems a little more like it  .Accordingly 331 WHP is ~ 388 crank hp using 6MT.(I assume these figures have been obtained with a relatively tight engine).And another different dyno run:\n\n287?Hmmm...Of course there are a plethora of factors here.But in just going to hush and wait for my car to come in. One month to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey dyno all the cars above 1 mile of the sea level, also they used low octane quality fuel, and that also adds to the factor why hp was so low, and why computer had to re-calibrate things.So, overall if terms were fair, I think it could easily pull 330 at the wheels.\n\nCheersRobin\n\nBy no means am I a Dyno expert. Here are a few questions I have.1. They used 91 octane (BMW recommended) but I feel 93 would have yielded slightly better results (+1 maybe +2?)2. Does anyone think if they put additional fans on the fangs that would have helped?3. That was a nightly long pull as well.More videos to come of dyno'd M2s hopefully. I was expecting it to at least break 300. And I was hoping for low teens.\n\nInteresting, thanks for posting. Well we'll just need to tune the beast won't we\n\nUtterly meaningless w/out other car's results on that same dyno with same conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible, that something needs to be done at the dealer, post break in? I know for the DCT cars, launch control is disabled until service one.Just a thought... Results do seem lower than expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some perspective, I had my m235i dynoed on a Dyno Dynamics at sea level in a 10C ambient room and got 316hp (crank that is, 266 hp wheel adjusted) stock running winter tyres (no where near ideal admittedly) that did need to cool down between runs.With JB4 running map 2 on 93 octane fuel it was putting out 349.6 hp (crank) and 381.2 lb-ft of torque (crank).Its going back on soon with summer tyres and sport cat. Will report back on this.I think people may confuse correct/ realistic with overinflated \"wheel horsepower\" numbers that other dynos are set up to produce. Bigger is always better right?\n\nNot sure what to think of this dyno result, but I expect it will do around 340-350 rwhp on a dynojet.",

    "content": "Recently picked up my M2 and always heard good thing about BimmerCode. I just got the OBD adapter and started looking at some of the options on the app in demo mode and don't really see any I NEED. I was hoping to easily add anti dazzle but that doesn't seem like an option without doing some sort of expert mode.Is it possible to code the backup camera to stay on even when going into neutral? My only 340i 6MT would stay on when shifting from reverse, to neutral, come to a stop and then turn off in first. Now the second I shift into neutral it turns off even if I'm still moving backwards. DCT now BTWAre there any MUST HAVES that I should do or should I just return the damn thing before I spend another $25 on the app.\n\nASD off.It was worth it for me just to get rid of the stupid startup disclaimer.\n\n\n\nI don't have Bimmercode but I do miss the camera staying on when putting it into reverse. My MINI did that.\n\nThat stupid disclaimer has to go, but unlocking the doors when you turn off the ignition is a must for me and that alone is worth the cost.  I also removed that silly volume level display that pops up every time you adjust the volume.The advantage to Bimmercode over similar products is that it's easy to use and is not limited by VIN - so if you have multiple cars, or friends with BMWs, you can use it for more than just one vehicle.\n\nASD off1-touch to turn off both engine and electronicsAuto-unlock when engine is turned offI think those were the most important for me but some people love the easy access entry where the driver's seat moves backwards every time you get in the car.\n\nIn addition to the ones already mentioned, it's easily well worth the money for me to have coded:- auto unfolding / folding mirrors with 0.5 press delay- headlight washers disabled- coding off sidemarker lights- coding bulbs to LEDs after replacing (2017 model)- coding idrive 5 to idrive 6 lite (2017 model)- tweaking welcome lights behaviour- turning on door handle lights when reversing- changing maximum volume at startup to 50%Probably forgetting a few others.  Great bang for buck purchase for me\n\nJust finished coding the car, I ended up going for it.I enabled PDC when the car is rolling back. It's fixed the issue where the camera would shut off the second you put it into neutral. It now stays on until you come to a complete stop. I'd like it to stay on until you start to move a bit forward but this is much better.I did some other things like Auto Unlock, brake force, etc. I think the brake force is a big one to avoid getting rear ended. What has everyone found is an ideal setting for this? What speed and brake force? 3 or 5 blinks?\n\nI just got Bimmercode the other day, after giving up trying to sort out esys launcher token insanity,.Used it to code my new LCI Euro tails.So far beside that, I coded rear DRLs, which look awesome.One question about brake force: the setting seems to be only 3 or 5 blinks per second, but I dont see a setting to actually enable or disable brake force lighting...  anyone knows what I'm missing?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "2017 6 spdAny body else notice that when you up shift while at WOT, there is a difference in time from when the clutch is released to the power being delivered when in sport+ vs MDM vs DTC held off, with DTC completely off being an almost immediate 1:1 engagement. I am assuming this controlled by some sort of software since the drive mode dictates that difference. Is this tune-able?\n\nDefinitely noticed it. Unsure if its tunable. I'm certain its just a bit of code to help save transmissions during the warranty period.\n\nYes definitely notice this.A gfb dv+ might help a little bit but it won't get rid of it all as there is definitely some software in play.I did think about hacking the clutch switch to get rid of it (I have done this in a porsche before) as the ecu doesn't know when the clutch is dis engaged, but have thought better of it as on a turbo car with an electronically controlled dv, that is just going to be asking for trouble.\n\nThe dv+ does help on a 2017 6MT.  More under boost in the mid-range on gear change than at WOT up top, but it is still a solid mod.\n\nI am not aware of the diverter valve mod but i will search to see what it is. Thanks! It def feels weird coming from the e46 m3 into this. It's honestly my only complaint if even that.\n\nShift between 6-7k rpm and power comes back immediately with wot.  Shift under 6k and I experience the delay on wot.  I find no lag though doing short shifts on 1/2 or 3/4 throttle, all this in Sport+\n\nThat is the way the DCT/ENGINE have been programmed. There is no way to fix it or tune it.The GTS update for the DCT had high hopes but turned out to be incompatible with the tranny on the M2.\n\nIf it's software then eventually it will 100% be fixable through a tune. I heard an istep flash to the latest version helps but I can't really remember.\n\nDoing some research and there is some kind of restriction device that needs to be drilled through in the clutch slave cylinder.This is what is causing a 1-2 gear slow shift. You can read through the thread here. Later on he drills through the restriction valve and his no more delay.https://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1486773it appears that the part numbers for clutch slave cylinder are the same between M2C, M2, F30 and:Quote:1' F20   (11/2011 — 02/2015)1' F20 LCI   (06/2014 — 08/2018)1' F21   (12/2011 — 02/2015)1' F21 LCI   (07/2014 — 08/2018)2' F22   (10/2012 — 06/2017)2' F22 LCI   (09/2016 — 08/2018)2' F87 M2   (11/2014 — 06/2017)2' F87 M2 LCI   (09/2016 — 08/2018)2' F23   (03/2014 — 06/2017)2' F23 LCI   (10/2016 — 08/2018)3' F30   (04/2011 — 07/2015)3' F30 LCI   (10/2014 — 09/2018)3' F80 M3   (04/2012 — 06/2015)3' F80 M3 LCI   (01/2015 — 08/2018)3' F31   (08/2011 — 06/2015)3' F34 GT   (07/2012 — 06/2016)4' F32   (11/2012 — 02/2017)4' F32 LCI   (05/2016 — 08/2018)4' F82 M4   (02/2013 — 02/2017)4' F82 M4 LCI   (05/2016 — 08/2018)4' F33   (03/2013 — 06/2016)4' F83 M4   (06/2013 — 02/2017)4' F83 M4 LCI   (05/2016 — 08/2018)4' F36 Gran Coupé   (07/2013 — 06/2016)\n\nQuote:1' F20   (11/2011  02/2015)1' F20 LCI   (06/2014  08/2018)1' F21   (12/2011  02/2015)1' F21 LCI   (07/2014  08/2018)2' F22   (10/2012  06/2017)2' F22 LCI   (09/2016  08/2018)2' F87 M2   (11/2014  06/2017)2' F87 M2 LCI   (09/2016  08/2018)2' F23   (03/2014  06/2017)2' F23 LCI   (10/2016  08/2018)3' F30   (04/2011  07/2015)3' F30 LCI   (10/2014  09/2018)3' F80 M3   (04/2012  06/2015)3' F80 M3 LCI   (01/2015  08/2018)3' F31   (08/2011  06/2015)3' F34 GT   (07/2012  06/2016)4' F32   (11/2012  02/2017)4' F32 LCI   (05/2016  08/2018)4' F82 M4   (02/2013  02/2017)4' F82 M4 LCI   (05/2016  08/2018)4' F33   (03/2013  06/2016)4' F83 M4   (06/2013  02/2017)4' F83 M4 LCI   (05/2016  08/2018)4' F36 Gran Coupé   (07/2013  06/2016)Yeah it's the clutch delay valve, but from what I heard before it was really hard to replace since it was built in. I'm not sure how easy it is to drill through but so far I dont see any aftermarket support like on older cars where the restrictor was removable.\n\nDo you feel it most on the 1-2 shift?  If so, it may be the tires spinning and the traction control system neutering some power when in Sport+/MDM.  It could also be the clutch delay valve intervention as F87Source noted.The other issue is simply the fact that it's a turbo with a manual transmission. Although the DME uses some wizardy with the electronic waste gate and timing to maintain some boost on on full throttle shifts above 6,000rpms, you still loose a bit of boost between shifts, especially the 1-2 and/or if you're not fast on your shifts.  This can create a lag or power on/off sensation.If you're running a tune on a 6MT, the momentary lag on shift, especially the 1-2 and 2-3, can be pretty apparent.   The lag gets really bad on my M235 when running the Dinan Sport tuner in Sport+ or Race mod.  It's so bad that I turned the thing off because of the inconsistent power delivery, especially on the 2-3 shift.  I could literally count to 1 before power kicked in fully on a completed, and quite hard, 2-3 shift.Two mods that have have greatly reduced lag on shifts and improved response in my M235, which is very similar to the N55 in your M2, are:1)  Installation of the Ultimate Clutch Pedal.  The UCP has greatly enhanced my ability to shift quickly in all situations.  The pedal is firmer, catches much faster, and the resting position is lower as well.2)  HJS Euro 6 300 cell downpipe.  The difference in throttle response and lag is immense, especially on full throttle shifts.  I do not notice any perceivable lag on full throttle, 6,000rpm+ shifts.  Even with no tune, the catted downpipe has increased power (especially in the mid range) and made the car far easier to drive, especially on 1st gear starts and the 1-2 shift.It's remarkable the improvement in driveability these two mods have made.\n\n\n\nInteresting, thank you for this info.  I find the clutch and manual transmission driving experience on the M2 to be very \"digital\".  It's almost comical to me, and I feel as though the 6MT was an after thought with the M2.  I do agree that there is always \"boost lag\" unless shifting is done above 6k rpm.  I also notice the power pulling nannies quite a bit, but I hope to combat the with some super sticky rear tires.  I really don't notice the CDV,  like it was in the old days though...\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know if coding the m4 gts dsc affects this? That car is supposed to be a bit of a handful, so perhaps there are less digital nannies - I'll give this a go next week.\n\nThanks for all the inputs and suggestions, the car is a manual and it does feel like the clutch delay valve on the stock e46 when in sport/sport+/comfort. It must be like some of you have suggested that some sort of electronic nanny is intervening because it doesn't matter what gear i'm in, it only feels like a normal mechanical old school clutch with traction control turned completely off. Very interesting indeed!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Fabspeed argues going catless is not always necessary and you can lose power compared to sport cats on modern platforms such as McLaren, Porsche, Ferrari, etc.Interesting article I read on B-O-O-S-T-A-D-D-I-C-T.c-o-m. Here's an excerpt from article:\"The conventional thinking is that going catless (ditching your catalytic converters) is best for power. That traditionally was the case but modern motors adjust so many parameters so quickly and are built for such efficiency that you can actually lose power by getting rid of the cats. Frankly,with German HJS 200 CPSI catalytic converters or sport cats you can have 93% of the flow of going catless. That means there is truth to Fabspeed's argument. Fabspeed makes a good argument especially in relation to McLaren platforms:\n\nYeah I 100% agree. CEL means the computer thinks something is wrong and thus will attempt to protect itself and change engine parameters. What parameters are changed will vary from car to car. So, if you go catless you definitely want something to fool the ECU into thinking that everything is in place and working properly, thus eliminating the CEL.Now for the unpopular part which comes from personal experience and admitted bias. I think EVERY car should have a cat and catless shouldn't be an option for street cars. As someone who grew up in LA in the 80s I can definitely see the positive impact of stronger emission laws. Just ask anyone that lived in So Cal for an extended period of time. Furthermore, I had asthma problems especially when growing up, clean air is extremely important to me. I like having the ability to go for a run outside without having to suck down a bunch of exhaust fumes while working out. But, I also value performance as I like to tune my cars. I've always bought high flow cats (had the fabspeed sport cat on previous car) but to me this seems like a good balance between not being too damaging to the environment but also getting to eat my cake too. Hypocritical - yes, but it's a balance that I can live with.Edit: Worth noting that the Fabspeed sport cat is of extremely high quality. I got pulled over and had to go to CA state referee for inspection. The car passed a rolling CA emission test at 25 and 35mph with the Fabspeed sport cat installed.\n\n^ agree 100%. I remeber stage 1 smog alerts where we werent allowed to play outside. Even staying indoors on those days, my lungs would burn with a deep breath. Seeing the San Gabriel mountains was rare due to the haze. Its so much better now thanks to modern emissions controls.I even dislike catless on track cars. Ive gotten pretty nauseous being stuck behind a row of cars for several laps under caution, while they towed a car off track.\n\niirc back when I had my old mkiv Jetta in 2005-2006 there were people reporting loss of hp/torque going from stock to 3+in downpipes (with or without cats) due to a loss of back pressure. Even tuned. The sweet spot seemed to be 2.5in downpipes on a stock turbo.In fact I've read my mkvii Golf R that I commute with gains little to nothing from a downpipe in many cases because the stock system is pretty decent being a performance car. The changes to the downpipe and exhaust are mostly acoustic and weight saving.I would imagine that the pipe diameters on performance cars these days are close out of the factory. The main difference being a restrictive cat due to regulations: . I can see a similar to stock size and a high flow cat being the best way to go. IMO\n\nInteresting read, its worth noting that not all cats are equal.A high quality cat will provide the same advantages as the catless without any of its disadvantages\n\nWe have seen some cars make more power with a proper HFC than testpipe.",

    "content": "I just used theTechnicPNP harnessto bypass active sound design (ASD) in my M2.  Install went exactly as described in the thread.The difference is remarkable.  I wish I had been more scientific and taken before and after SPL measurements; I think it's gotta be 6 dB at 70 MPH.For those of you concerned about the cabin noise or irritated by the artificial sound you should do this mod.  This is the absolute best modification I've made to a car ever.  Thank youTechnic!This car sounds great and the ASD detracts from that.  Of course there's more noticeable road noise with the ASD bypassed, but that's obviously a separate matter.  I suspect BMW cranked up the ASD to cover for the missing sound deadening.  But the effect is overwhelming IMHO and I'm absolutely glad it's gone!\n\nThanks for posting, I am going to definitely do this mod.  From the videos I have seen it appears pretty intrusive when you go into sport or sport plus modes.  It will be nice to just have the natural sounds in the cabin.\n\nBuddy, can you please do some recording for us as we would be interested to hear the difference.\n\nPlease make a comparison video between with and without ASD. That would be greatly appreciated.Another point is the question if you really need this option. What if we just code it out or pull the grey ASD plug from the HK amplifier? Either option is a lot cheaper than paying for this cable and it does the same thing.MR\n\n\n\nSorry, I love you guys, but I'm not gonna tear my trunk apart again for comparative analysis. I wish I had borrowed a friend's SPL meter and done a before and after for a more scientific review but that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm just glad the ridiculous booming is gone and I can hear my own thoughts while driving this great car!\n\nCan someone confirm that this does not also disable the electronic flap for the exhaust. Obviously that would be a very undesirable side effect. BTW I ordered one today\n\nNot sure why it would affect the exaust, but I can confirm it does not. Same, sick cold start sounds!\n\nOnly reason I asked is that the comfort and sport setting which affects the ASD also affects the exhaust flap. I didn't know if they were tied together in some way. Anyhow, good to hear that they are indeed separate. My bypass harness is on order.\n\nGot it. The link in my original post has a detailed 2er installation walk-through. Another member struggled with the connector keying, I think maybe they forgot to swap the housings. The guide covers all this. I used a spare hole in the main amp's mounts as a mount-point for the original cables tie-down then cable tied the new harness to the mount-point I removed the original cable from on the ASD module. It was easy to do a clean install.There's almost zero sound deadening in the trunk...made me wish I had a roll of dynamat on hand. There was a big slather of glue on the driver's wheel well in my car; someone must have been preparing to do an M235i sound dampening install when they realized it was an M2.\n\nInstalled mine tonight. One less item on my to-do list.\n\n\n\nThe real deal is much better than the artificial stuff.\n\nWould it be reasonable to remove a fuse to hear the car without asd prior to coding it out or bypass?  Apparently fuse 122 disables the radio and asd.\n\n\n\nDo you think there is any difference in comfort mode without ASD?\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks.   I plan to disable Asd ASAP.\n\nGuys, I want to film it someone when I have time, but I do not know how to do it. If I come up with an option to find a decent comparison I will make one. First need to order that cable and install it.MR\n\n\n\nDoes the ASD amplify the engine noise even at idle? Have noticed the engine is noisy in the cabin, in a bad rattly type of way.",

    "content": "The stock m2 is such a beast of a car but I am looking to spice it up. I was interested in getting Dinan power package p2. I've heard many times the argument that Dinan is over priced but you pay for quality and warranty. I get that but I guess my question is ignoring the warranty part of the debate how does Dinan modded cars preform compared to stock? Is it a subtle or a noticeable difference because 7k is not cheap. Any advice would help due to the fact that nobody really talks about the difference between stock and p2. Or is there a different company I should look into?\n\nDefinite power bump, and it makes the car a lot of fun.If you’re not worried about warranty, the Dinan Turbo, bootmod3, and a Wagner Evo II Comp intercooler will get you a little more power with smoother delivery.\n\nDinan advertises 450ish hp and torque, is this to the wheels or crank? Because I have seen stock m2 dyno runs all over the place.\n\nThis has been covered so many times. P2 and S2 are the same in power. Any of these links will give you enough information, as well as the dozens of threads in this forum talking about it.https://jalopnik.com/heres-what-a-bm...des-1793961890https://autoweek.com/article/drive-r...ew-dinan-s2-m2https://www.automobilemag.com/news/f...neering-s2-m2/\n\nIs there any other mod I should look into like headers or a down pipe if i get the p2 package?\n\n\n\nThe big difference bn the above and adding the turbo into the mix is the turbo will pull peak power to redline. The stock turbo with the mods above starts to lose power above 6k rpm.The turbo makes a big difference on track, if you’re into that. If not, the mod list above is good for the street.\n\nI have Dinan Stage 4, Turbo, Fuel Pump, Wagner Intercooler, Fabspeed catted downpipe and Remus exhaust.  Big difference over stock, very happy with the upgrades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the added power worth 7k? No.\n\n\n\n\n\n@NTownM2I'm pretty new to all of this, but I've been checking prices for a while now on pretty much your exact setup.  How did you manage a Dinan stage 4, turbo, fuel pump, Fabspeed catted DP, Wagner FMIC, and Remus exhaust for less than 7k?The Dinan stage 4 and turbo is like $3500 with no core (not sure how much cheaper it is with core) and Remus exhaust is around $2800.  That's $6300 not including $1400 for DP, $900 wagner EVO II comp, plus at least $240 for fuel pump build kit, and installation costs (unless you did it all yourself, though a lot of people pay to have it done).  So, we're at $8840 without install.Not trying to disagree with you, just curious how you were able to get all that for less than $7k.  Hook me up 🙏\n\n\n\nI bought the Dinantronics Stage 1 piggyback for $325, used on eBay, so no warranty. If you purchase the hardware individually online, you can spend like 4-5k for everything minus the labor.The harness is braided and feels sturdy, well though-out and you can tell it's a quality (handmade) cable.The Dinantronics ECU sits on tops the fuse box and from what I understand it contains a fast processor, which sample data 4,000 times a second. The unit plugs directly into the vehicle's ECU, then routed back to the engine harness. It being able to intercept all the engine's sensors and alter it before the ECU does, gives it full control over its entire logic.It was a bitch to install because the engine's ECU harness in buried in a tight spot, so you have to squeeze in and feel around to hit the release. My hand afterwards looked like I got into a fight with four cats.What I feel it does is add smooth power right up to the redline, instead of tapering down when the over-boost times out.. It's not massive but you do feel discernible a different in power output.I didn't want to get a flash because there is still a lot of unknowns with aftermarket tunes and this motor. Also, I'm worried about failing emissions; with a tune, they disable the catalytic converter plus MAF sensor and in NY if their computer shows that more than one emission control device is not in a \"ready\" state, you don't pass. With a piggyback, you can just unplug it, no altering the stock mapping.I suggest you get the stage 4 ECU right out the bat, which requires a upgraded turbo and intercooler but you can use their APP and toggle down from stage 1-4, depending on which hardware you have. In my case, I can only use the APP to bypass the tune.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I didn't have a lot of money to go for a whole exhaust system and came across the cat-less down pipe  which was the best bang for my buck upgrade I could've made. The installation was extremely easy since it was a bolt on mod and allows for easy removal if I was to have my car leased which I don't.Performance/Sound:As soon as I installed this into my car and drove off I could already tell the difference the down pipe made within seconds. For people who love turbo spooling you can hear it like you hear someone talking in your ear right next to you. With exhaust sounds this thing can fight with cars that have no mufflers. The sound of speeding up and the start-up make it sound as if the car has no muffler to begin with. The backfires and burbles on the car are equally as loud or louder than the car itself. This gave my car around 10-15 whp and you can feel the difference as soon as you wham on the gas. It definitely feels as if you gained a lot of power from that tiny pipe.I honestly think this is THE best mod to buy if you're looking for something that makes your car compete with other cars, but you don't have that much money to spend.

    "content": "Hi,I enjoyed reading Mishimoto's post on their new BMW F Chassis intercooler. I hope you guys enjoy it as wellOriginal author: NICHOLAS THOMASULTIMATE COOLING  2012-2016 BMW F2X/F3X INTERCOOLER R&DPART 1  STOCK REVIEWMishimoto prides itself on the ability to improve the cooling systems on just about any vehicle that rolls through the garage door. Intercoolers have become our bread and butter at this point. That being said, BMWs are notoriously over-engineered, so improving on the meticulous German design isnt going to be an easy task.It seems that the engineers at BMW wanted to make sure they provided the best equipment on their Ultimate Driving Machine, which means tight spacing. Peeling the front bumper cover from our loaner 2014 335i M Sport reveals a space no bigger than a toaster oven. A tricky intercooler project lies ahead, but thats OK, because were up to the challenge.The front fascia is secured on tight, but our engineer Steve, left, and project manager, Rob, make short work of it.The F30 335i with the front fascia removed. The M-Sport aero package includes its own full set of shrouding and duct work.BMW already has an adequate design on their stock intercooler. Its a stout tube and fin unit with a fair balance of fin density and spacing. On top of that, the diverters residing in the inlets ensure the full use of the core when cooling charged air. The shaping of the M-Sport aero bumper cover and use of shrouds directs maximum airflow not only to the intercooler, but to the four other different cooling units mounted on the F30s front end. Its also apparent that there was a collection of careful engineering that went into the stock intercoolers mounting configuration. The plastic end tanks are cut to precision to ensure the intercooler nests between the primary radiator and the undercarriage cover. In short, the intricacies of the front-end design mean that we have our work cut out.The Stock intercooler unit. Note the guides on the end tanks for seamless mounting under the primary radiator.BMW packed a lot of fins into a small space.The well-designed front end adds a second degree of difficulty to our design process. In a perfect world, we would increase the density, and surface area, and take up whatever available space is left. The problem with this model is there isnt much space, and blocking the other components could lead to increased coolant temperatures. One of the challenges were facing in this process is the shrouds. Our loaner 335i has the aggressive M Sport aero package on it, which is not the most commonly used front fascia for the current 3 series.The full array of shrouding and ducts that had to be removed just to get to the intercooler.The standard cover not only uses a different shape, but also different shrouding. Ideally, our new intercooler will be designed to fit on the 4-series, as well as the 2-series, but, you guessed it, each model has its own set of fasciae and shrouding. The size requirements vary from each model and accessory package, so we are working on a solution to have a unit that fits across the board but still retains the factory trim.The available space we have to work with for our intercooler design.Because of our limited timeframe with the Bimmer, and the intricacies of the project our engineer is already at work on the improved design of the intercooler, and sifting through the complexity that is BMWs abundance of fasciae and shrouds.Steve using our Faro Design ScanArm to create a 3D model of the stock unit so he can determine the envelope for our improved design.ULTIMATE COOLING  2012-2016 BMW F2X/F3X INTERCOOLER R&D PART 2  DESIGN PLANSWhen I last left off our engineer, Steve, was busy scanning and creating a 3D model of the F30 stock unit as a reference for our new design. There is an impressive amount of engineering that has gone into this intercooler project already, with more to come. One of the reasons for this attention to detail is because of the wide range of models that this new cooler is going to fit, as seen by our photo gallery. Another reason is because BMW has a pesky habit of living up to their moniker, The Ultimate Driving Machine, they leave little room for error.Steve working the Faro Design ScanArm to create a 3D model of the stock intercooler unit.Ive always been a huge fan of BMW, especially when it comes to the meticulous engineering that goes into each of their vehicles. Every model they put out is designed to last. Whether it be a 28-year old 3-series speeding around the flat back roads of New Jersey, or the much bigger and heavier X3 taking on the winding mountain roads of the Colorado Rockies, leaving a smile on your face also seems to be a design requirement. For most BMW owners, the thorough engineering and attention to detail is more than enough, and typically such thought in the design process shouldnt lead to adverse characteristics. However, we saw differently upon peeling back the front bumper cover of our loaner 335i.There were a few recurring themes in the stock review of BMWs intercooler which were the abundance of different shrouding and duct work behind the bumper cover, the lack of space to work with, and the wide range of fitment our new design has to fit. These three factors left us with two different designs to choose from.The disassembled front end of our loaner 335i xDrive. The section of the fan that is showing is about as far down as we can go with our new design.The first design we were thinking of was an intercooler similar to our E9X unit in which we would just expand the width of the core to increase the volume. We already have a baseline of the general performance and fitment of this design, so it seemed almost like a no-brainer. Almost.  One of the problems we would run into includes, of course, fitting it with the factory shrouding. Unlike the E9X, were designing an intercooler to fit on 3 different models, each with different variations on the equipment and styling packages.Our E9X 335i intercooler.Performance with this design also becomes an issue. With a thicker core, yes, there is an increase of volume, but as it heat-soaks, the returns would be at a higher temperature since there are now more layers of fins for the airflow to penetrate. Increased core volume is always an improvement, but as the core thickness increases, the return temperture increases. As the cold air travels from the front of the intercooler to the back, its picking up more and more heat. So, the front of the core might receive ample cooling, but the rear section will still see higher temperatures.Another viable design option was to stretch our new intercooler over the available space in the front of the Bimmer, with a design that is both tall and thin. Filling the space between the primary radiator and the crash bar means having a core that has an increase in volume and surface area over the stock heat exchanger. An additional benefit to this design would be a thinner core, meaning the heat can be transferred from the charged air more efficiently.There are, of course, some drawbacks to using this design. The biggest obstacle is operating around what keeps the car in one piece, the crash bar. The small price to pay for keeping you safe in the case of a crash is that this bar blocks airflow from the upper section of the intercooler. We plan on keeping the inlet diverter to make sure the full core is being used, but that wont matter if there isnt any airflow to a third of the core. On top of that, theres still the stock shrouding to contend with for fitment.A comparison of the shrouding and duct work found behind the M-Sport fascia, left, and the standard fascia, right, on the F30s.There is one main thing that keeps getting in the way of our design process: the shrouding. If its a constant burden, why not get rid of them all together, or make them fit the design? Well, its not that simple. For starters, modifying stock parts can get a little dicey. The biggest concern would be voiding the manufacturers warranty on your BMW, since most of the F2X and F3X models on the road today are still covered. We wouldnt want to be the reason why you would have to pay out of pocket for all your maintenance needs. On top of that, any kind of modification to the car or original components will only make the installation more complicated.The only model on our fitment list that would possibly require any  modification would be the M2 because of the more intricate front support, but well leave it up to you on whether you want to modify this piece or just remove it. So, we decided that instead of modifying your shrouding, you just wont put it back in after installing our intercooler. With the factory shrouding out of the way, Steve had more freedom to work on a design that would not only fit across the long list of models, but also outperform the stock unit and competitors.The orange arrows indicate the front support braces that would impede installation on the F87 M2. These will need to be trimmed if the full support brace is not removed.Removing the factory shrouding will change the flow of air into the intercooler and cause issues with directing airflow, of course. Without all that plastic mounted behind the bumper, the airflow is not guided, and while most of it will be passing through the intercooler, we want to make sure that all the air is being crammed through those fins and delivering the best returns into your intake manifold. We saw that as an advantage.While the shrouding on the standard bumpers will still fit with our design, we took the liberty of designing our own sets of shrouds to direct the airflow to the intercooler. Steve has designed a set specifically for the M-Sport kits, which will mate with the factory brake ducting, and seal against the crash bar at the top back side of the bumper cover. For those of your without the M-Sport aero kit, dont worry. There will also be a set included for the standard bumpers. They will feature a similar design, but will have a cutout for the lower bumper support bar. In both cases, these new shrouds will create almost a sealed passage directing the incoming airflow straight into the intercooler.We want our included shrouding kits to have a snug fit to make sure that the intercooler is getting the maximum amount of airflow.Before we get to the big reveal or what our plans are, lets go over the other improvements to the intercooler. On the top of that list, aluminum end tanks. Plastic, while light and easier to produce, just wont be as durable as our aluminum tanks. Over time the stock plastic end tanks will degrade, which can cause cracks and leaks, leading to less power to your N55 or N20, but the metal tanks can stand up to the elements, and improve the airflow into the core. The end tanks will get some help from diverters that will be incorporated into the inlets to ensure the air makes full use of our new core. The core construction will also be changed from tube-and-fin to bar-and-plate with our new design. While the tube-and-fin construction has its advantages for the manufacturer, a bar-and-plate core will have better cooling properties. However, the improvements to the core can only be as good as the overall design of the intercooler itself.Although we repeatedly talk about the downsides to plastic end tanks, its still a great material to use for 3D printing and quick turnaround on fitment prototypes.Computer rendering of the new intercooler designWe are getting around these drawbacks by taking the stepped core concept and making it our own. Were adding width to the base of the core, and Steve gave the top section of the step a 115-degree angle. We designed this intercooler to mate up with the bottom edge of the crash bar, meaning all airflow from the bottom will be directed into both sections of the intercooler, without blocking the radiator and AC condenser. When all is said and done, were looking at an estimated 963in³ core volume which is a 96% increase over the stock unit.  As I mentioned, there will be two sets of shrouding included specifically designed for both the M-Sport and standard models, to make sure the air flows where we want it.Our initial test fitting with the first take on the shrouding on our 335i loaner. With the weather stripping the top section rests against the crash bar and the shrouds will mate up to the fascia.A peek as to what the installed intercooler will look like on your F30. Plenty of room for the optional brake cooling ducts.ULTIMATE COOLING  2012-2016 BMW F2X/F3X INTERCOOLER R&D PART 3  PRODUCTION SAMPLEIts been a long time coming since we last left off with the development of this intercooler. While it might have been trying on your patience, and a little on ours, its not necessarily a bad thing that it took some time. Simply put, how are we going to make sure that what ends up at your door step is perfect if the first doesnt possess the same qualities? And sometimes doing things a little differently takes some time.If you look back to our last post outlining the design plans, youll see exactly what Im on about when it comes to doing things differently. We did end up giving a good amount away then, but since its been a while, Ill refresh your memory.Yes, the stepped core is nothing new nowadays. With the F2X and F3X Bimmers, the design of the stock system almost requires a stepped core in order to squeeze more performance out of the N55 and N20 engines. During our development process, we investigated the idea of a few other core configurations, but neither quite stacked up to the stepped design.We wanted to make sure that our stepped core design stood out from the other companies with the same idea, so we added a 115° angle to the top section. This angled step-core design not only increased the volume of the intercooler by 96% to 963 cubic inches, but also ensures a direct flow to the top section of the core. To help with shrugging off heat-soak, weve swapped out BMWs original tube-and-fin core construction with the more heavy-duty bar-and-plate construction. The new core design might add a few extra pounds to the front of your Bimmer, but the improved air passages allow for better flow of the charged air through the system, and the improved fins are better suited for wicking the heat out of the channels.Its not often we are able to show you what lies beneath our sculpted end tanks, but since we decided to chop off the tank, its a perfect opportunity to show you what a bar-and-plate core looks like.In addition to assembling a curvy core, we put some serious engineering time into the end tanks as well. We completely ditched the plastic surrounding the core and substituted in cast tanks, purpose built to allow the charged air to flow freely in and out of the core and maximize your N55 or N20s potential after a tune.While the new core might look out of the ordinary when it comes to intercoolers, we still need to test it to make sure that it performs as good as it looks. We have plenty of testing in store to ensure that standing out with our design paid off. From the flow bench and making a racket on the dyno to figuring out what the best shrouding situation will be when it comes to swapping out your intercooler, there is still plenty of information coming your way.For an even closer look at our design make sure to check out our latest video:ULTIMATE COOLING  PERFORMANCE INTERCOOLER R&D, PART 4  TESTING RESULTSEveryone loves a dynamic character. Think about it. When have you ever read a book or watched a movie and said to yourself, Wow, Im really glad that the main character didnt develop throughout the story? We long for that feel-good moment when the protagonist reaches a turning point and changes. The development for our F20/F30 intercooler has a relatable plot line.R&D is a process with its own ups and downs. Thats what makes it a challenge, and thus fun for us problem solvers. Even with a lot of research and simulations, some things lead to unexpected outcomes. If you look back through the beginning stages of our development, its clear that were taking a unique approach when it comes to the stepped-core intercooler. If youre worried that adding the angle to the top of our intercooler core was the part that worked out differently, never fear, it does its job. The topic of shrouding is the aspect that eventually took a different turn once we arrived at the testing phase.Heavy ShroudingNo matter which specific 2, 3, or 4-Series you might have, theres still plenty of shrouding that seals the intercooler in place.We all know that BMW is notorious for putting some serious engineering hours behind just about every component of their vehicles. When our first loaner car arrived here at our Delaware facility, one of the first things we noticed was the multitude of shrouding that sealed in place the intercooler and front-mounted heat exchangers. We figured that those German engineers were on to something and began developing different sets of shrouding of our own. However, when it came to the wide fitment list, we ran some extra wind speed testing to help narrow down which shrouds specifically we would need.We ran this test in four parts. For each test, we fixed one of our airspeed meters to the front of our loaner M2 and took it for a spin to collect real world data on how the air flow hits the front end of the Bimmer. We ran the car with the stock intercooler and our core, both with and without shrouding, and found that the shrouding actually made little to no difference when added to our intercooler.Under PressureWhen it comes to upgrading any turbocharged car, pressure drop is a hot topic that always comes up, especially if youre talking about larger intercoolers. Increasing the volume and packing the internal fins tight is bound to slow the airflow through the system and account for some drop in boost pressure. The hard truth is that pressure drop is inevitable when upgrading the intercooler, unless you like having an intercooler that easily heat-soaks.Creating an aftermarket intercooler that performs is a balancing act, since were looking to accomplish much of the following: a drop in charged air temperatures, maintained boost pressure, and additional power. We have to find an equilibrium with the core size and fin pitch to deliver. The stock unit has a fairly loose fin pitch and a smaller core, meaning it has a decent flow reading. However, that, combined with the tube-and-fin construction, means this core will soak up heat with ease.Our core utilizes a bar-and-plate construction, which aids in the charged air flowing through the core. We did pack some extra fins inside the core, and crammed them closer together, but we were still able to drop the outlet temperatures and add power to your turbo-Bimmer all while keeping the pressure drop under 2psi.The Real TestOur new F20/F30 intercooler design might be a looker, but looks come second in the case of this performance intercooler. For our dyno testing, we chose to use the cream of the crop on our fitment list, the F87 M2. Transplanting the heart of the mighty 335i into the body of the nimble 2-Series has been one of BMWs best ideas yet, and now we have the opportunity to put it to the test on our Dynojet system.Our loaner M2 started bellowing through its aggressive aftermarket exhaust with our standard power pull test. When we run this test on our Dynojet, our engineer, Jason, will cycle through the gears. At 5th gear, hell put the hammer down. This test gives us a benchmark of how our new core design dissipates heat under a single load, and also answers the question that everyone has: How much power does it add?With an added max gain of 10hp/8tq, and a 45°F drop in temperature on the outlet over the stock intercooler, we can call it a day, right? Definitely not. Unless 100% of the driving you do with your BMW is drag racing between the stoplights, theres another chapter to this story.We talk a lot about heat-soak when developing our intercoolers, which is why we have a test to see how our designs stand up to torture testing. For this test, we run a sequence of power pulls, one after the other, which allows the system to fill with heat and is a true test of how well our new core can shrug off those increased temperatures.Even after putting our loaner M2 through the ringer with our intercooler equipped, the outlet temperature was kept at the average 45°F difference over the stock core.When we first started this project, we found ourselves asking the question, How do you make the Ultimate Driving Machine more Ultimate? BMW has a long and extensive history of putting serious engineering prowess into all their vehicles so that you get that ultimate driving experience. Even with all those engineering hours spent, there are still some things to improve on. If you also find yourself asking how to add to the BMW driving experience, it looks like we found your answer.",

My only mod at the moment is Fabspeed sport cat.It would seem with the valve closed there is potential for the muffler to be a point of restriction as the inlet pipe diameter is substantially larger than the single outlet.  I'm guessing any affect at the engine would be delayed while pressure builds up back along the exhaust pipe.The Technical Training manual says \"In the higher gears, the exhaust flap is closed in the critical ranges. The same applies in the upper engine speed ranges depending on the load\".  I've not been able to find more specific information as to when/why the valve closes but I can say that since I've removed the fuse to keep it open full-time I've noticed sustained spirited driving now leaves an even spread of carbon across the 4 exhaust tips whereas before the valve side tips would stay a lot cleaner.Obviously the MPE and other after market exhaust valves operate differently and I've wondered also whether the performance gains of after market exhausts could be linked to the stock valve operation?Any engineers out there who can educate me?\n\nTo give quieter cruising sounds\n\nJust a shot in the dark here but maybe at high rpm it is not compliant with US noise levels so it had to be closed to be compliant in all states\n\nI've followed my wife in her Macan.

This would be a full pipe replacement using machined fittings and silicon hose to replace the current plastic tube. It would also include a significantly larger opening at the turbo end and be completely smooth, removing the accordion section and dimples found in the oem pipe. I have already spent a bit of time and money to work out the logistics and now I need to find out if there is a desire for this as I would need to take pre-orders to make it happen. Please let me know by responding in the comments if you would be interested. Price point is currently unofficial but would likely be between $175 - $250.Before this can move forward any further I would need at LEAST 30 solid commitments.Also note: A final design will be released before actually accepting pre-orders.

But it's not expensive, and it is a good preparation for power boosts in the future.  No real downside to it.  So I picked up Pure's complete unit at $275.

    "content": "Fellow OG M2'ers,I've come across the following information pertaining to the installation of the GFB DV+ and wondering who has experimented with the \"Main Spring\" install. Installing the \"Main\" spring, I feel should allow the diverter valve to react more fluidly bleeding off positive pressure just enough to equalize rather than the valve over stroking and dumping all boost between gears. I don't think light switch on/off is a good thing over \"just enough\" modulation.My main concern is: How will the BM3 OTS tune(s) react with the DV installed with the modulation spring!?FYI -My 18' MG LCI is currently FBO on BM3 Stage 2 93 Tune now. Going to Dinan BIG turbo, DV+ and Pure inlet in 2-3 weeks.Cut & Paste Instructions from GFB:The DV+ can be configured in two different ways, depending on your desired outcome. Fitting the DV+ with the main spring installed as shown on the previous page can be thought of as a Sport mode,offering the best possible throttle response and boost recovery during on/off throttle applications (i.e. during gearshift with a manual transmission).Using the main spring means the DV+ can open and close progressively in response to how much boost pressure is present, unlike the factory diverter which just opens fully regardless of whether there is boost to vent or not.Because this operation method is different from the factory diverter, it is not unusual or detrimental to hear a different sound from the intake when lifting off the throttle at low RPM, especially if you have an aftermarket intake or a larger turbo installed.Additionally, in some cases this different operating method may be mis-interpreted by the ECU as a faulty diverter valve (it simply sees the diverter doing something different, it doesnt know the diverter is actually attempting to improve throttle response), resulting in fault code P2261 being recorded.This does not indicate that the DV+ is faulty, nor does it cause any issues to the turbo or engine. If the fault code or different sound occurs and you want to prevent it, or you simply want a direct replacement for the factory diverter that is stronger, holds boost better, and lasts longer, you can chooseto install the DV+ WITHOUT the main spring behind the piston.This configuration can be thought of as an improved Standard mode, which behaves just like the factory diverter, but with the added benefits of better boost-holding, strength, and reliability.Any real life experience with the above??ThanksNitro\n\nPicture of Valve\n\nIt doesn't affect the tune any way. I also use it with BM3 OTS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- There is no error code.- I don't feel it with my butt but maybe you can measure it somehow with OBD tools.\n\nAnyone installed? Wondering if I need to upgrade this with my inlet, charge and boost pipes upgrade?\n\n\n\nI've got a Dinan P2 kit with their piggy.  I definitely notice a difference on boost lag between shifts with this unit.  But I've got an MT, so that's a different animal from what many on here have...\n\nI just did a bunch of upgrades and have 6mt too.  I was running FBO and VF-E stage 2 tune.  I could NOT keep the car in boost unless I shifted above 6k rpm.  My pure stage 2 turbo came with the DV+ pre-installed.  I have no idea if pure uses the extra spring or not.  I primarily waned the DV+ for reliability, but sustained boost between shifts would be a great benefit, along with improved throttle response.",

    "content": "Update: 12th March 2019 ——Ok so I tried 5.7 tonight and all I can say is YES!... THIS is what I was hoping for. I tried the OTS burbles first and was impressed but not quite what I wanted so I spent some time playing with custom settings and wow. I put Sport to 0.5 seconds and 0.5 aggression (with the aim of a very subtle burble in comfort mode) and then for Sport+ I tweaked it to 0.7 seconds (1 was too much, 0.5 was too short). And aggression to 7... ok, I know this might be silly but I had a lot of fun. Now when I rev it out to 4K+ on WOT and then release, it gives an almighty 'crack', which I love. I still notice for whatever reason Comfort has too much burble though, so either it's inheriting some settings from the Sport+ mode or I simply need to turn aggression 'off', not sure. Will tweak later. Nothing major though.Now onto performance... still not the best weather to try it out in but yes, I can definitely notice some difference now. The wheels are spinning more easily than before and I don't feel it 'drop' higher in the Rev range as much as before. Can't wait for some summer weather to try some real tests.All-in-all, very happy now. Performance is improved, burbles are awesome and cold-start delete is a god-send for my neighbours. I think the transmission thing must have just been in my head. Might try GTS transmission next week. Just wish my first impression was with 5.7 and not 5.6!Original ——Hi all,I decided to give BM3 a go today and flash my M2 with a Stage 1 93 Octane tune. I'll be honest, I am a little disappointed and I am hoping someone can help!First: It seems the gear change velocity from OEM Sport+ mode has been copied over to the standard Sport mode. While I understand this might improve shifting performance in Sport, I don't like it. Reason being is that I love the exhaust \"thud\" sound you get when shifting above 4k rpm in Sport mode. It seems with these OTS tunes the drama is replaced with shifting performance. If I want the best shifting performance however, I used to switch to Sport+ mode. Any remedy?Second: The custom burble settings. Do these actually work!? I read that \"Sport\" equates to Comfort and \"Sport+\" equates to Sport/Sport+ in the car. Is this correct? I spent all evening playing around with these settings and they didn't seem to make any noticeable difference. Worse still, when I customised the \"Sport\" setting to have 0 duration and 0 aggression, my exhaust was still popping away in comfort mode (which is what I want to avoid).Thirdly (and lastly): Is it just me or do these OTS tunes alter the way that slow-speed braking works with DCT? By this I mean when moving slowly in traffic and then coming to a stop, the car seems to now jolt suddenly to a stop.If anyone is able to provide tips on any of the above it would be hugely appreciated!\n\n\n\nAs far as I'm aware, Bootmod3 doesn't touch the transmission unless you specifically flash the GTS transmission tune, which is separate from the other tunes.About the burbles, nioh_lbbm2 is correct. There is a flaw in v5.6 that is affecting them.I've never experienced any jolting to a stop when stepping on the brakes, and I live in a city where my average speed is under 15mph. The only jolting I feel is when I apply the throttle really lightly in first gear, seems like it's waiting for more power for the clutch to grab properly, but this happens completely stock too.\n\n\n\n\n\nShifting and brake issues are all just in your mind. DME flash cannot touch these area.Burble is a complicated thing to tune. It's true the BM3 burble adjustment bar is a hit or miss. But, to be fair, no one aside from BM3 offers any level of burble customization. You can ignore this feature with BM3, yet at minimum you always have OTS/AGG/OEM options. Think about it, how great is that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now you can flash \"OEM\" burble so that there aren't any crazy burbles in comfort mode.Alternatively you can go to custom settings and turn duration and aggression to the lowest for Sport and leave Sport+ untouched\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic to hear you had good results! End of workday needs to come quicker. I'll end up doing some logs of v5.7 as well just to see how it compares. Just for my own peace of mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill no real dynos of the BM3 93 map with everything else stock?",

To re-torque the turbofold to the factory specs?!\n\nThanks for the heads -up.Any thoughts on cause of failure ?Material defect, manufacturing issue, installation issue (torque, misalignment, etc)?\n\nI think the answer is simple.  There is a method to tightening the turbofold down, which is very German.  By that I mean, it's similar to tightening down head bolts, LOL.  I can only assume that the lazy BMW tech did not follow the procedure properly.  The gaskets are kind of strange.  Here's all the info you ever wanted:https://www.newtis.info/tisv2/a/en/f...-with-control/\n\n\n\nKeep in mind every time you remove turbofold, the gasket cannot be reused and needs to be replaced.These sealing parts are supposed to work with the hottest part of the car and the thermal deformation is permanent.\n\nDuplicated post deleted.\n\nThat gasket did it's job. I see no sign of an actual leak.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "I just picked up an '18 M2 and will be having the stage 2 mods and Bootmod3 stage 2 done next week.  With my previous non-BMW car, I worked with a custom tuner, datalogged etc. and fine tuned everything.I'm curious what experiences have been with the OTS Stage 2 tune vs. then doing a custom tune.  Halim's name seems to be mentioned a lot.Have others noticed a big difference in working with a tuner vs. the OTS version?  I'm leaning towards working with a tuner but was curious as to the experience of others.Thanks,Russell\n\nIt will depend on who you use to custom tune, especially now the latest ots is pretty strong. Halim does the ots maps for bm3 but also has his custom tune business HCP as well.Speaking to a m2 owner who runs another well known Custom tuners map, this latest ots is quick a bit quicker than the custom map. Using 100-200kph as a gauge for performance.Halim used my car to test various revisions to improve the ots maps which lead to the current ots we have on bm3. Revisions were quick and I wouldnt hesitate to use his custom tune service given his track record with f-series BMWs.For me I will look for a custom tune once I sort extra fuelling out. Until then I will run the ots.\n\nHalim is the master!  He built a custom \"Stage 3\" high octane/high boost tune for my 2018 M2 FBO + Dinan \"Big\" Turbo completely stock fuel system running 93 + 1-15oz bottle Lucas Racing Offroad Octane Booster.Here's a version 5.6 Stage 2 93 log vs. Custom Stage 3:http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5c81d495c090c6261a0318dbhttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5c758ff3c090c609408878e4\n\nTo OP, I was very interested the custom tune and reached out to Halim per other forum members advice. However no response at all and turned out very frustrated to consider him as a custom tuner. Maybe he just focused on specific mod situation, not for everyone on the standard Stage 2 mod. I just wanted to share my experience but maybe not for your case. Overall I just don't feel the same way as some other forum member mentioned. Good luck!Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the numbers I’ve seen, I very highly doubt a custom tune will do better than Halim’s OTS Stg 2 map for a standard FBO car. The guy has done more N55 tuning than probably anyone out there.A buddy of mine had a custom FBO tune and the OTS pulled just as hard and was way smoother than the custom tune. My buddy was shocked about that.I would only worry about custom if you go with a bigger turbo, more fueling, or some other special situation.\n\nI have Stage 2 BM3 93 octane, OTS maps are the best out there in my opinion. Unless you are upgrading turbo, fuel, meth.... OTS are great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nttvetdocAs said earlier, you will only want to do it with bigger turbo or meth (octane & fueling). But if you have access to AKI94-95 (RON99-100), the custom tuning definitely can extract 20-30hp more for you.But, there is always an octane/IAT point passing which you lose power. Without hardware upgrade (like turbo), the more boost you have, the sooner you will get to that point. That's how less consistency is defined.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Just put on a fabspeed sport cat over the weekend. When I was under the car on the first startup after installing it, I noticed a metallic ring type of noise coming from the exhaust. I had never listened to the car from underneath with stock exhaust so I didn't know if it was normal or not so I left it as is. Now on cold starts there is a distinct metallic ring for the first 10-20 seconds that seems to go away after the valve closes. I can hear it from inside the car with the windows closed and it definitely wasn't there before. I think everything lined up nicely on the install and I used all new gaskets including the V Band Crush gasket for the midpipe. Any thoughts?\n\na vid will help us out to help you.\n\nI'll try taking one later today. It's pretty subtle, we'll see if it picks up over the sound of the exhaust itselfReading more last night I think it's the wastegate that's open on startup making it so loud, not the valve. So may be related to that more so.\n\nNot the greatest audio but just for context, the audio picks up right after the initial loudest 8-10 seconds of the cold start (this was too loud for the mic), where it gets slightly quieter, and then at 15-16 seconds you can hear it go into normal idling. You can clearly hear the metallic ringing noise in this middle period. I assume the first 8-10 seconds of cold start is open wastegate and then that closes and the valve stays closed/open (?) for the next 5-10 seconds before it gets quiet. The metallic noise happens from initial startup to when the valve changes. It's not coming from the engine bay at all and appears to be loudest right at the downpipe/midpipe area but I can't really localize it. Any ideas?Edit: this is a 2018 m2 with 1300 miles, no other mods.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nReinstall it.  Something is vibrating.  Make sure the v-clamps ate seated correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: the noise is getting louder. Still most prominent in a cold start but I can hear it through the engine noise while driving now. I'm considering taking off the downpipe to see if it changes or goes away. Not really sure what's causing it anymore\n\ncould be anything but how about the end of the long bolt on the clamp? maybe it's hitting something like the metallic under panel?\n\nstart the car while it's on a lift. that should help you find your problem area real quick.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wont go away on its own, did you check the exhaust valves?\n\n\n\n\n\nMost likely the wastegate on the turbo, sports cat just amplifies it over the oem cat.\n\n\n\n\n\nGot this sound too with my 300cpsi catted HJS dp. Sounds normal to me. Might be the open wastegate during coldstart...?\n\nHmmm good to know!\n\nI also have that metallic ringing sound at cold start, but after the valve closed, it goes away. The shop installed it. Mine is not as bad as yours. Maybe because of your bad recording and garage parking lot. I didn't notice the metal ring until ~300 miles because my exhaust got a lot louder after awhile (in a good way) lol.That ringing sound is only at the cold start (5-10s). I thought I'm the only one.

    "content": "Hello Forum Fam, I have been on the e9x forum for years and the f8x forum as well new to the F87 forum but this annoying exhaust rattle drove me nuts when I heard it. WOW.Okay down to the fix.I jacked the car on a lift, and the main issue here is the clamp when the mpe has been installed. I looked by the canister and it was so close to the heat shield by the rear diffuser I knew something was wrong. That is the rattle my friends either that or the support bar right under the clamp.I simply loosened the exhaust clamp holding the oem mid section to the MPE rear section.Push the pipes closer to each other and tighten the clamp back to where it should be. ( I personally pushed the exhaust can closer as my mechanic tightened the exhaust clamp)NO MORE COLD START RATTLE.\n\nPics !!\n\nMy cat back exhaust fixes to rattle have always been to remove any clamps, weld the sections and add an exhaust flex pipe to allow some movement. My last MPE on a 135 was to weld the clamp or remove the clamp and weld. My prior car needed a flex pipe to reduce vibration.\n\nHey everyone so my brother took the m2 for a drive and came home saying it's rattling again... I'm guessing it loosened back up, anyone else experiencing this ? This is a new performance edition m2 should be most recent parts\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MPE is made by company not too far from where I live in UK. I took my car to them. They confirmed to me the rattling on cold start is 100% caused by people not pushing the tips ends 100% all the way home. This is the actual fix.In reality, there is actually very little room for adjustment on the tips once the exhaust has been fitted. People are pulling the tips out waaaay to far to see the \"M\" logos.If the complete system has been fitted correctly and aligned perfectly underneath the car then the tips should only require a few mm here and there for OCD adjustment.The ends of the main stainless steel pipes coming from the muffler should not be seen through the perforations in the exhaust tips.I guarantee if you unscrew, push right home, and torque back up, maybe a little more than the recommended 5nm (but don't go silly) your cold start rattle will go.\n\n\n\n\n\nI understand but I am in belief that it is coming from the main connection under the car. Will be taking the vehicle into the dealer tomorrow for warranty.\n\nI'm pretty sure they just brought the pipes closer and re tightened the clamp today at service under warranty. Let's see if it comes loose again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@ OP, andBishUKI had the MPE rattle and I told my dealership about your ideas/fix.The tips are now +/- 2 inches(5cm)  more inward below the diffuser rearbumperr than before. And the coldstart rattle is gone. Thanks both.CheersRobinNow:http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/Mokkiwokki/ex3_zpsilbuipop.pngBefore)I know angle of picture is different....\n\nOk, guess I am going to have to try getting the tips moved more inward. The tips look pretty good although seems they can go in a bit more. I am now going on my 4th clamp, coming pretty much completely loose after every track day/weekend. This is BS and is driving me nuts!\n\nHad the exact same thing with mine and pushing them further in fixed the problem as well\n\nMore info about the manufacturer.https://redarcheng.co.uk/news/bmw-m2...duction-ramps/\n\nNice...I always thought the tips stuck out too far...anybody know the socket size for the clamp bolt?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "First off- sorry if this has already been covered. I didn't find it in my searching. Also, I've seen the chart outlining the different modes and options, but that doesn't really address my question (it's a great chart though).What exactly is happening when going between the modes when you have an MPE where the valves are controlled separately by the remote?  Is anything other than throttle response changing?  I coded out ASD, but I swear I can still hear *something* in the exhaust note that is different going from Comfort into Sport, and possibly even Sport to Sport+. I have even changed modes while off-throttle to try and eliminate any change in exhaust note from the ridiculously sensitive throttle response increase too.  Maybe I'm just imagining it. My theory is nothing is happening other than a change in throttle response, otherwise the full DSC-off mode, which you would want to use on the track, would be hindered by not having whatever change might be occurring in Sport/Sport+... and that just doesn't make sense.*Side note rant*- speaking of not making sense. Coming from an F80 M3, I'm not a fan of this single \"all in one\" Comfort-Sport-Sport+ settings arrangement. I miss having \"power\" adjustment in one button, then steering and EDC in different buttons, and being able to turn off DSC independently. I don't understand why turning on limited DSC or full-off DSC on the M2 would change the throttle response mode from Sport/Sport+ back to comfort-style either.  While I'm ranting, it's dumb you can't turn on/off auto-blipping and that it only turns off when you disable DSC. Also funny that BMW decided to turn off auto-blipping in Sport+ on the F80, but left it on in Sport+ for the F87. Can't be consistent?? *end side rant*All that being said, I'm not really complaining, I absolutely love this car. Can't wait for the next track day in 5 weeks.\n\nSport and Sport plus adds more “burble” to the M2.  That is due to the throttle response changes.  So yes exhaust changes with mode selection even without opening the exhaust valves.\n\nThanks for the response. Sorry, I should have stated more clearly that I do notice the extra burble in Sport/Sport+, but it sounds like it is overall louder as well. So I thought however unlikely that maybe something else was opening up elsewhere, or maybe the tune actually changes to a degree.\n\n",

Because in 2017 running similar boost (and less timing) on RON98, my Dinan turbo struggled big time ignition wise when IAT goes above 80F.\n\n\n\nSo, are you and Halim just going to keep pushing the boost level until you see knocking?Also, if octane booster is the best long term solution bc of ethanol/HPFP flow issues, I wonder if Torco or Boostane are better for the car, albeit more expensive?https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...ghlight=OctaneWhat say you, M-Supra?BTW, thanks for pushing the envelope!\n\n\n\nV3 Log from this morning.It's a damn good thing I live out in the country where the PoPo/Speeder ratio is in my favor, 2 lane mountain road (flat, straight section)HPFP rock solid, no knockage, 18.4psi, 12 degrees timing, 5th@6431, had to slow down to prevent launch off mountainsidehttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5c758ff3c090c609408878e4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm ready to stomp some M2C ass...as long as they're stock\n\n",

However, you constantly read from vendors that adding a Stage II tune to account for the downpipe will take \"full advantage\" of the downpipe and gain more power. So what is the tune changing between the stock downpipe and aftermarket downpipe maps?I can't find on the interwebs anything that indicates exactly what is being changed other than the same regurgitated stuff. Is it air/fuel ratio, timing, boost, something else that's changed? If they are adding boost, well that is largely why there's more power.

    "content": "Hi,Ive been keen on getting a JB+/Dinan Sports Tuner, but I was wondering if anyone with one has checked their AFR whilst using it?I came across a post of with some dynos (admittedly not for an N55, but an N20) that showed the engine was running richer on a JB+ (as compared to a JB4) and really starting to run too rich.Link to that post here:https://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1432046Does anyone have any experiences/knowledge on this?Im keen as I like the simplicity of these solutions, but the M2 is going to be a long term car for me, so I dont want to risk any long term damage if the AFR is out.Cheers.\n\nHaving used a couple piggybacks and then switching to bootmod3, I can say that the car runs much smoother and has more power with BM3.You may want to go that route vs worrying about piggyback performance.\n\nRunning rich isn't damaging like running lean.  I wouldn't be surprised if these simple piggybacks cause a richer condition under boost given what they are doing to boost sensor.I've had the DinanSport on the M235 for about a year.  I've played around with all the settings (Sport/Sport+/Race).  There is additional power in all the modes, BUT it comes at at a cost, especially with the 6MT cars.  Even in the Sport setting, it makes the throttle hyperactive when in the Sport and Sport+ driving modes.  There is more lag during normal driving and on harder shifts. I think it has to do with the DME trying to understand why so much boost is being commanded.My butt dyno is pretty well tuned and I can notice minor changes.  Overall, I've found the Sport (about 2psi+) setting to be the best mode for the least amount of lag and the best driveability is all temps.  HOWEVER, the driving dynamics with the stock tune (i.e., DinanSport set to \"Stock\") delivers, without a doubt, the best driving experience.  It's hard to explain unless you've add a DinanSport or JB+, but the motor just doesn't feel as flexible or smooth winding with these piggybacks running.Right now, my DinanSport in stock mode and enjoying it.  I'll be installing an HJS Euro 300 cell downpipe in a few weeks.  I'm going to see how that feels and then I may turn the DinanSport back on.  If it still doesn't drive as smoothly as I like, I'll likely sell it and get a flash tune as some point.\n\nXutvJetMy experience with the Sport Tuner was very similar.Are you getting your 300cell thru Fabspeed or somewhere else?\n\nThanks for the experiences on this.I think I will park the idea of getting one of these and get a tune (bootmod3 or similar).Cheers all!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Or you can figure out how to get the software to mate the ECU to your car yourself, I'm not sure if anything we have available can do that, so you'd have to get the software and tools from BMW or a bootleg third party.Then you have to take apart half your motor to swap it.https://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1180947Pretty sure BM3 lets you flash completely back to stock, with no trace of it existing.\n\nActually, just found this response by PTF that might be more helpful to you.\n\n\n\nThanks for answering my question.

    "content": "Hi guys, Bmw m2 lci 2018, bought brand new in Nov 2018, black shadow... 4700km on it, break in at 1970 km. yesterday on a 100 km trip, about 50 km in (so all conditions at optimal level) I get an drivetrain malfunction warning, orange one, saying possible to continue journey, full perf not available. I stopped at the next gas station, stopped completely, waited a little, stated up again, 5 meters in drive (didn't actually get to leave the gas station) the warning appeared again, of course with the power of a Dacia Logan. Dealer that sold me the car was located in the city I was headed to, so called and brought the car in. A thing that I 've noticed at the gas station, was a sound that I didn't heard before, like a ... I don't know how to describe it ... chirping sound, engine belt like sound, hearable only in silence, in traffic condition, I can't hear it. I forgot to mention that I didn't do anything to the car, in terms of mods and other things, drive it like instructed during break in, no track days etc. Never had an issue before this. The dealer took it in. after 2 hours, I called them, they said the car didn't cool down enough, so they didn't get to check it yet, another 2 hours and got the call, said that at first, when it did cool down, it didn't why to start at all, after that they did manage to start it and read that it was something to do with the fueling system, and that they don't know what exactly yet. Friday afternoon, almost closing time, so I have to wait until Monday for further inspection. Did have time to check the fuel pump in the tank, and that was ok. Said that they never encountered this at an m car before. Reason for posting, beside the frustration and heartbreak for my New and first bmw m car, I don t feel very comfortable with the ideea of someone deconstructing my car bit by bit, until they find the problem, as they said they will. Searched the bimmer threads, saw the software solutions, will communicate it to the dealers, but I don't think that's the case here, the noise take me that something real is up. Got a x1 18d xdrive replacer, so I guess the \"I got that going for me\" meme is appropriate. If anybody got some ideas, so I can help the dealer service, let me know. Thanks, have a great m weekend.\n\nSorry to read of your troubles. Keep us posted!\n\nI believe some people had some trouble with the high pressure or low pressure fuel pumps, but only at the track, or even badly modded.\n\nWas your gas-tank almost empty?If so, NORMAL!!! If you kick the gas- pedal with an almost empty tank, the car will go in to Limp- mode (yes, the car sounds and feels broken...)... Very frightening but harmless. Fill her up, all back to normal (after a few km).If not, stop and start again (there might be some air-bubbles left in the system).If your tank was full... Sorry, can't help...\n\n\n\nIt was not, I left for the trip with a full tank of gas, 50 km in and limp mode. I've got a call from the dealers yesterday, they say it's a problem with the high pressure fuel pump, the thing didn't have enough power to send fuel to the injectors, so... 2-4 days for new pump delivery, and one good day of labour. If after tests all run smooth, I'll get my car back. If not, there may be other issues. Hope not. I think this is not a very big issue, even tough it's a new car with 4700 km on it. What do you think, does this affect the car in any way, is this a bigger issue then I make it, does it affect it's resale value, etc.?\n\n\n\nYup, under warranty. Will keep you posted. Did any of you buy extended warranty, and if so for what period? I still have the option to extend mine, feeling kind of constrained after this incident.",

You need right air/fuel ratios, boost, fueling and timing to run properly. If you have more compression without the right tune you can hurt your engine components.

No CEL, no limp mode, no nothing. And boost/ignition/AFR spot on.

Ordered the pipe in October of 2018, I was told it was on the shelf and would be sent out that week..... its now Feb. 12th and I now just get it.It looks like some trash out of China. Being that I paid a premium, they have since lowered the price, it should have at least been cleaned out properly and inspected closer before shipping.Here are pics, am I being too picky or does something seem off about it.\n\nChina makes the best welding in the world and craps at the same time. And charge accordingly.It's up to the middleman that gets to decide the price to ask customer.I'll be kind enough to comment that the problem with your downpipe isn't the welding, nor the cleaning of it. They shouldn't do the 'sleeve and weld' way to begin with, if you know what I mean.I hope you try to learn a bit more before stereotyping, especially on the quality of the manufacturing, where China is the absolute global leader in terms of both volume AND QUALITY. And we don't even have a close second.\n\nFigure of speech, dont lean so far left... but you get my drift.  The quality on this piece just seems subpar.From the design standpoint, I'm curious if their method here will have any drawbacks.  I'm feeling iffy on even installing it.\n\nThere's no debating the volume China produces but the quality on certain products varies greatly from very good to trash.  The welds look fine but it wasn't cleaned properly and the design (this could be dictated by the vendor) is poor.  If a company puts their name on a product it's on them to ensure it's designed properly and of good quality.  AFE kind of failed on this one.\n\nI don't care for the smaller dimensions of the inner welded pieces. If you were to perform a computer aided visible flow test you'd see that air is very turbulent  at each step effectively reducing the diameter of the slip pipe by at least .125 -.200 of an inch.Nitro\n\nThose welds look quite good, basically nickels laid over on one another.  The depicted stepping of the pipes isn't going to disrupt flow because the flow is exiting on that side.  I'd reach in there to clean out the manufacturing debris.Lastly, looking at the AFE website, you got exactly what you bought.  The pictures show the same exact DP.  Plus, these DPs aren't a \"premium\" price.  The list price is $966 and most are selling for $100 less.  The Fabspeed catted DP is $1,400.  I just paid for $1,450 for the HJS Euro 6 300-cell DP.https://afepower.com/afe-power-48-36...-pipe#overview\n\n",

Is it harmful?\n\nWho's stage 2?\n\n\n\nI've been running BM3 stage2 tune for about 2-3 weeks(installing my DP and FMIC tomorrow). 98% of the driving has been around town keeping it off boost, occasionally revving it out for a moment, no issues.\n\ni drive my car with stage 2 stock cat hard. Just don't go crazy on the burbles and you are fine. Octane is very important\n\n\n\nWithout a downpipe thats stage 1.  You guys realize the calibration actually changes because the flow of the engine changes right?  Its not like some magical slider that tuners do in order to add more power.  Theres actually boost control models and when you dont have the correct hardware youre opening yourself up experience lots of problems.  Run the right tune for your hardware, and if you want to be loud while decelerating youre gonna need a downpipe so you dont burn down your car.\n\n\n\nDo some data logging of your EGTs\n\n\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN54 here but sounds like similar situation.

    "content": "I'm about to pull the trigger on Vorshlag F Series camber plates in preparation for some spring and summer tracking.  Will probably run at -2.5 front.Reading some last minute reviews and I keep seeing the term NVH which is new to me but apparently stands for Noise/Vibration/Harshness which I guess some camber plates can add to the vehicle.It's a big purchase and not one I want to regret so does anyone have experience with Vorshlag camber plates and possible rattling and noise that might result, or other camber plates for that matter?Is NVH inherent if you do camber plates or rare?Thanks.\n\nNo issues with my Vorshlag’s. 40+ track days, 20k miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of info on this in the Suspension section of the forum.I daily it. -1.8 on the street, -3.1 on the track.\n\nAlso, can you run them on stock suspension?\n\nI reached out to Vorshlag with this question and one of their engineers gave me a very detailed and technical response so I thought I would share it here and close the loop on this.   I'll report back after i've had the camber plates installed for awhile.\"John, there are three issues here, so I'll address them all.#1, yes, all camber plates, all brands, even \"street\" plates, add some NVH to any car they are installed on. Our camber plates do not make or cause any noise, but removing a big chunk of rubber and replacing it with metal will allow noise from other parts of the car to be transferred to the tub, and on to the passenger compartment. Adding a small isolation biscuit, or a rubber gasket under the spring isn't enough to change this. There should be NO knocking or rattling from the camber plates though, only a slight change in harshness and other noises being passed on. For most cars it is about the same as going to a +1 tire fitment.#2, the F30/F80 series cars have rubber embedded sphericals in their suspension which is great for  performance use, but passes on more noise than the solid rubber or fluid filled bushings they used to use. We are finding that about one in ten of them have an issue with something in the lower suspension, front cradle or transmission. This issue is making noise and transferring it to the tub. This is more noise than normal, and it's isolated to this series of BMWs. We've had customers swap from one brand of camber plate to another, and then another with the noise following them. I can't tell you if your car will be a noisy one or not, and despite a few dealers digging into these cars we don't know the source of the noise. I have not had an affected car available to us to see if we can find the source, which I suspect is a control arm bushing that has a good spherical, but damaged rubber.#3, the first short run of camber plates with OEM style spring perches I made for this car did not accommodate the upper spring isolator. We found that as the spring moved it would make a \"tick\" noise as it compressed over the nose of the spring perch. One of our customers gave us feedback about this issue at the same time he posted online. I redesigned the spring perch to use the OEM upper spring isolator and sent them out to the few owners that had the early version. That solved the spring-tick issue they found.\"Thanks,Jason McDaniel - Lead Engineer, Vorshlag Motorsports\n\n\n\nGood info here, looking to buy Vorshlag Camber plates too so I can get more negative front camber for trackdays..",

The car is relatively low milage and well documented.Also, was CarPlay available in a '16 or could be added?(I'm a audi/vw guy and when you get to Stg3 many think you also have to do internal upgrades for long term durability)\n\nNo internal upgrades needed.If the parts were installed by an authorized Dinan shop, they carry Dinan’s warranty until the car’s warranty expires.\n\nhttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1530545It adds ~80 bhp. The N55 engine can easily handle the added power.\n\njust to clarify, I've read the different related threads, but hadn't seen any discussion about internals.  in buying a used car, I was concerned about this aspect for long term durability.   safe to assume the DCT is not bothered by the additional power?It seems people's concerns about Dinan are primarily based on ROI vs other options, and secondarily having to cut some bracing for the FMIC.  I suppose if cost is not a consideration Dinan is a respectable option, is that fair to say?  Again, I'm not a BMW person and wondering if making APR comparisons against my Audi/VW experiences is fair.   appreciate the input.\n\nAll that sounds right, and the DCT and its clutches are good to 600hp.If you’re not worried about the BMW or Dinan warranty, some guys like BM3 with the Dinan Turbo more than the Dinantronics:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1568593\n\na MY16 could have iDrive 4 or 5 depending on how early or late in the year it was built. iDrive 5 can have ACP added to it.

The m235i has more torque so it gets off the line better and stays ahead but the top end of the m2 made it pass the m235i at around 100mph.Basically the dinan is a ripoff unless you need to retain their factory warranty matching or whatever.

    "content": "I installed the DCT transmission update to GTS. Indeed the shifts are faster and smoother.However, now the car is very sluggish. Before the upgrade, in SPORT+, the car reacted very quickly to throttle input. Now, it is very lethargic and does not stay in gear like it used to during hard accelerationAny ideas.\n\nAfter a lot more research found out that this is what happens with the GTS tune. Everyone had been raving about this a while back but I don't see why.Seems someone would have figured out how to fix this issue. I could not figure out what the C meant until I read all the posts. Tis really sucks.I will revert back to stock.\n\n\n\nThe problem is as follows:The GTS flash made for M4 not M2, however it works on M2. On the M4's you have the ability to adjust the DCT's aggressiveness, however, on the M2 you cannot.So in auto, the transmission is at the least aggressive setting (1/3 bars on the M4), and once you go through to manual, the transmission has the most aggressive timing (3/3 bars on the M4).I've had a F85 X5M (Sold now), and an M4 CP, and both exhibit the same transmission behavior. D is automatically on softest setting on startup, and once you shift to M, it automatically goes into the most aggressive transmission setting.The only difference on the M2 is that you can't adjust the transmission aggression presets if you wanted to.Hope this clarifies it.\n\nYep I found out after I flashed. It bothered me that nowhere on the Bootmod website was any disclaimer.You would think with all their abilities to modify ECU's they could fix this. It is completely illogical that BMW would code it this way. The DCT with GTS should follow the settings as it does without the GTS.I did like how it shifted however.

    "content": "Hey guys, over the past year we've worked with a number of customers and shops that chose the XDI's high flow pump as their HPFP upgrade. They have two versions available, the XDI-35 and the XDI-60, both of which outflow the OEM HPFP pump on the N55.As of now any bootmod3 user looking to go with an XDI HPFP upgrade can go into any of their maps (custom or OTS), use the map configuration screen and choose the appropriate pump from a dropdown of options, screenshot attached.Note that simply installing one of these pumps and not making the changes will end up setting the car into limp mode (Drivetrain Malfunction) as well as throw various codes for fuel pressure so a map change is required to run them.For all questions related to the pumps please direct them at TTFS (TuningTechFS) who have done a great deal of work with XDI to make this upgrade happen when it comes to fitment and R&D and they're best to answer any questions. We're simply adding software support for the pumps to make the solution as Plug'n'Play as possible. We have seen a considerable improvement over the stock N55 pump on an M2 while tuning with TTFS end of last year and more recently on an N55 PWG car (both come with the same OEM HPFP pump).Here's a log of the N55-PWG car running the XDI-35 pump. As you can see there's no pressure drop at the HPFPXDI-35 HPFP on OTS 2H map, Pure Stage 2 turbo PWG car (no HPFP drop outside of traction loss event at around 3900rpm):http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5bcf486cd10b435a2d3651ceOEM HPFP on OTS 2H map, Pure Stage 2 turbo PWG car (400-500psi HPFP drop):http://services.bootmod3.net/log?id=...0b4365a7303ff0\n\nGame Changer!N55 guys will finally be able to make big power without external fueling mess or controllers\n\nDefinitely the way to go for extra fuelling....would be cool if xdi/TTFS etc would do a price for the pump only without their base file for guys that have the bm3 option\n\nI have been running the 35 pump in my pure stage 2 (m235 xdrive) for several months.

Good job guys, it'll be more convenient to just tap a box and get support for the xdi pumps, rather than getting a calibration from ttfs and having to flash that before doing the final tune.Are you guys developing flex fuel? To me that's the most desired/game changing feature that could occur on this platform.Also are you guys planning to add one touch support for the precision racewerks coils?\n\nIf the 35 option a single pump, and the 60 a dual setup?\n\n\n\nI intend to run the dual pump....gathering pieces as we speak.

I was actually very happy to see enthusiasts like you who mod tastefully, rather than go cheap way for big power. I share the philosophy.When this HPFP mod came out early this year, I was trying really hard convincing myself to bite that 2k for it. Because in my book, a proper DI solution has always been the way, as opposed to adding extra injection (PI), a compromise with N55 for many years.Out of 10k BM3 users globally at this point, few can beat me on this - Halim (huge thanks) made me LITERALLY 30~40 Custom maps since early 2017. And outside of Halim, there are 12 from Cary Jordan, 7 from Dzenan Becic and 3 from Joseph Wu. From these some 60 dedicated custom maps, Rich/Lean, high/mild boost and more/less timing have been all tried. That is tons of log testing, and a couple track days. But in my case, fueling has been always much less of a problem. I'll tell you that knowing the restriction isn't the fueling really pissed me off, because I cannot improve via upgrading fueling like many of others do.One more thing - If you open map editing file, you'd be probably surprised to see our DME actually compensates very little, load wise, for temp. From BMW's point of view, they leave a good amount of headroom to handle environment variance so their cars perform consistently enough to their spec across all conditions. But once you tune, you lost most if not all that headroom (up to the tuning approach), therefore you'd be very vulnerable and sensitive to temp and need ultra high octane to handle everything. There're many clean logs at 70F (of IAT), 80 or ~90. But very few are doing great at 110, let alone 120~130+ IAT which is the track condition. Tuner don't tune to that condition because number wouldn't be pretty, customer would be unhappy and go away.Appreciated if you give input from your personal experience tuning your N55.Sean\n\n\n\nThese costs are tough to swallow.  Really tough. Basically to really benefit you need a bigger turbo to justify the bigger fuel pump.I feel like a safe 460-480whp would be a riot in a well setup 2 series.  More so the M2 as it can fit a little bigger tire.  Approaching 500whp would be icing on the cake.Unfortunately, it's quite the endeavor to get there.  $2300 fuel pump, $2500 turbo, $600-ish in other install bits, plus whatever your labor is or a shop's labor is.$5500ish is a lot of money.\n\nHey Guys,I am going to be doing this soon as well.I will be having TTFS dyno tune my car once the pump is installed.  I look forward to sharing my results.\n\n",

Or is that the only option to cut the old ones off?Thanks\n\nYou just pull the stock tips off. Lightly tap them from underneath with a blunt object and then they just slide off. Just don't yank them off iff you're planning to keep them.\n\nMost popular tips for us are Active Autowerke and VRSF\n\n\n\n\n\nI just ordered some knock offs of dhgate.com that look like the real BMW was only $250 for the set of 4 with shipping vs $250 per for the real deal.

They look great and fitment is perfect.Install takes about 20 minutes. I sprayed some WD-40, then used a hard plastic piece and a mallet to loosen the tips. Then just pull off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust got mine!

Not sure there is enough space will confirm after install.\n\nTest fit pictures below.  They fit however I personally do not like how far they stick out and that the rivers show.  Will need to cut down the exhaust pipe probably about 2 inches for my preferred look\n\n\n\nThey're in all the way however the way they are designed all the way is only half way.  They have a second smaller diameter piece for the perforated part so that is causing the problem with them stick out.  I'll post a pick of the inside from the other side later\n\n",

REALLY?)- ECS Tuning Stainless Steel Brake Lines/SRF Fluid- I'll be putting on Mich PS4S tires in the spring.Future Mods?:- Downpipe- Tune\n\nGo for it!\n\nI'd track it with what you have currently first. Collect data from your butt dyno to get an idea where you want to invest next.\n\nDownpipe is by far the best sound/power for your buck.  That was my first mod and would be the one I recommend doing for sure.  I have the Fabspeed sport cat and it has been great.\n\n\n\nNot a big fan of this setup, sounds like they are just trying to sell you expensive parts without taking in consideration your mods.If you plan on getting downpipe, you should get a flash tune Like Active Autowerke or BM3.It will auto clear the code and take advantage with stage 2 mapsAlso you should not be getting 5\" low density intercooler, you should get a 6\" intercooler like Wagner EVO II, CSF or VRSF race.",

Anyone else been getting this?  I have a Fabspeed HFC and JB+ installed.  Thanks.\n\nWhat's your setting on the jb+?  Might try turning it down a bit if it's at max.\n\n\n\nThe CEL does not come on while I am driving, only when I start the car the next time\n\nRemove it for a week\n\nYeah... I don't think the JB+ at Max settings is a good idea on the M2 N55.. the M2 already is fairly aggressive on its stock tune.. your best bet is to go full JB4 with the M2 firmware or run an actual flash\n\nI am gonna turn it down and see if it continues.  It is just so strange that I have been running it for as long as I have with no issues until now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a JB+ and had the same P112F code. Went from Max, to 5, to 3 to out!The code would drop off after about 6-8 new starts, but still a pain.IMO it is not suitable for the M2.\n\nsorry for the old bump, but people who got this code, get rid of it by removing the JB+?Got the same code on my 2013 N55, but after 6 month using the JB+.Note that the car is running fine, and still pull hard, I felt no difference at all.I can't really play with the setting, since its a 1st gen JB+ (the one with 4 plugs on it), and with the latest BMS software, the reading are inaccurate (see picture).The code appeared after a really cold morning (-24°C drybuld, -11°F)...It might be related...\n\nSince turning mine down I have not had any issues with getting this code again\n\nthanks,any thought on the JB4 ?A good friend of mine is selling his JB4 since his M235 go back to the dealer.160$, its a steal !but I wont get into all the installation process if its not better...\n\nI don't really have any thoughts on a JB4, sorry.  All I can tell you is that, that would not be the direction I went in if I was planning on really tuning my car.\n\nI feel like unless you're using it as a meth controller, JB product is not something to be used on an M2. Too many stories and flash tunes exist for reasonable price.\n\n\n\nYeah, my car is still under warranty too, that is one of the reasons why I have not pulled the trigger in a real tune.  Especially since one of my injectors went bad and they were pressing me hard about a tune.  My stock is only changing the DP, Intercooler, Charge Pipes, Intake and JB+, LOL.\n\n\n\nOh gosh. The fact that you guys are getting warranties done with a Jb+ or JB4 just means youre lucky.People who think running a piggy back or worse a dumb device that simply reducing reduce voltage on the MAP sensor baffles me.The M2 has a overboost mode that other N55s dont. Because of that it runs about 13-14psi when overboost is running and roughly 11psi without on the stock tune.Using a pure additive tuner will be a very bad idea as the engine wont see the additional boost until it does a MAF plausibility check along with the increase in fuel consumption.Youre lucky the M2 targets relatively rich AFRs. I guarantee the OP cracked a cylinder head due to lean condition with the JB+\n\nIt's been flawless for me on Map3.I apologize if every other person who's had first hand knowledge had a bad experience with the JB4.Would not run the JB+ though.But we do have options so that's always good!Not everyone will jump the wagon and go MHD or BM3 if they don't find it necessary.",

Recently found an 2017 M2 with the Dinan S2 package I.e. tune, turbo, exhaust and suspension.  Anyway can anyone provide their input on their experience with the Dinan S2 kit?1. Is it daily drivable with 446hp?2. Have you tracked/HPDE'd the car and any issues with over heating etc.?3. Overall thoughts?Appreciate the input.\n\nI have a 18 LCI with the Dinan P2 hardware installed.   Same as S2 but without suspension upgrades.  Absolutely drivable daily.  Just makes it better.  And oh my is it quick with the 446 HP.   I will probably add the dinan suspension upgrades this year.  On rougher roads as we have here in Ohio the stock rear suspension struggles a bit with the added power.  I understand it's better with the Dinan suspension tune.  I would do it again.  Grin every time I drive it.\n\nS4 is 446hp, not s2\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need turbo, intercooler,  cold air intake and the stage 4 tune to reach 446 hp\n\nI had stage 4 dinan on my dct 2017 m2.  It was quick.That said, it barely broke 400 lb/ft.  My stage 2 m235i zf8 hit 450 lb/ft.\n\nI have a pseudo-S2 package with tuner/turbo/intercooler but with MPE and M Perf. Coilovers. For daily driving it's definitely doable, a bit boomy with the MPE drone at highway speeds though.\n\nThanks all appreciate the input both the sig and the S2 package both make the 446hpThis is the sticker on the car if this helps clarify what has been done.\n\nShould be a blast.I have all the pieces except the sway bars and exhaust. Lots of fun on the street and track.For track, you’ll have to run 96+ octane on hot days, and you’ll probably want a high flow downpipe to keep exhaust gas temps lower.You can find many of mine and other threads on the forum regarding tracking this setup.",

    "content": "FeaturesIncreased PowerLifetime WarrantyImproved Fuel economyDirect replacement30% less restrictive that your OE filterUnlike their competition, Pipercross have adopted multi layered foam technology for their air filters as opposed to cotton or paper. Why? Because foam has a larger capacity for filtration over cotton or paper. In road use terms this means that a Pipercross filter will flow stronger for longer and maintain peak power output of the vehicle over a cotton or paper counterpart. Whilst the cotton or paper filters begin to restrict airflow due to being thinly stretched over a V shaped wire frame the Pipercross with multi layer technology will continue to perform.The low maintenance and long lifespan aspects of a Pipercross filter come from the special triple layer foam that is used on all Pipercross filters. The outer core is coarse foam designed to trap larger particles, the middle core is Medium foam designed to trap most particles and the inner core is fine foam which will trap the remainder of the particles. The triple layer foam design ensures an exceptional level of engine protection in any conditions.How will a Pipercross panel filter benefit you?Directly replaces the air filter in your airbox30% more airflow over a standard paper air filterLonger lifespan before cleaning required over cottonEasy cleaning, no dirt caught like with V shaped filter groovesBench tested for improved fuel economy, power and torque outputsLifetime warranty on all replacement and performance road use filtersWhy are Pipercross foam filters better than the competition?Pipercross, based in the UK home of motorsport have over 25 years of road and track racing experience when it comes to filtration. Through this experience and engineering only the highest quality is achieved which is passed onto you through more power, torque, fuel economy & throttle response. Why settle for lesser filter brands which only have road experience when you can have quality proven on the track?Below are just some of the Pipercross sponsored winning teams.British Touring Car Championship: Airwaves RacingBritish Drift Championship: Team Falken, Acorn MotorsportIrish Drift Championship: Team Falken James Deane and Alan SinnotEuropean Drift Championship: Dmitriy Illyuk - Monster Energy and NC DriftingWorld Rallycross: Liam Doran Monster EnergyTime Attack: Eurospec, DAR and Bo NielsonHow is a Pipercross air filter manufactured?All Pipercross air filters are manufactured right here in the UK. At the Northamptonshire headquarters and manufacturing facility all filters are hand made carefully to ensure you are always receiving the best quality today on the automotive aftermarket. Pipercross pride themselves on being British manufactured and will never outsource for cheaper or lesser quality processes.

And I do see that in Sport mode the steering firms up a tinny bit. I wish it would firm up more. It's a long way from the feel that I have in the 135iSo, does anyone know if Bimmercode (or something else) can change the firmness/assist of the electric steering?\n\n\n\nfirm !== feel.I feel a TON of feedback from my front wheels, sure the resistance feels different, but in driving cars that are notable drivers car with EPS.. ( BRZ, S2K, 911 911, etc ) I don't see what people are seeing with the M2..Granted I have the Performance Edition with the lower manual seats, less weight, and M Performance coilovers.Feedback is great... maybe the alcantara wheel is helping but I don't think so.\n\n\n\nWell...I have found that in Sport+ the steering (and throttle) feel is much closer (still no match) to my 135i.I had avoided Sport+ because it turns off DSC and I wasn't quite ready for that. I had just recently done the burn in service.So, I think I could live with Sport+ constantly on... is there a way to code that to be the default?\n\n",

There's posts on other forums too that I followed (no pictures unfortunately).The best way to install it, separate both pieces!I tried it both ways, when doing it as one piece the threads from the clamp got stuck in a harness that I couldn't see. Kept the car torn apart overnight because I just couldn't pull it out, so frustrating! At the same time I was installing an intercooler and charge pipes (easy). Once you install the machined piece into the turbo, it's fairly easy. Just a little tight, need some extensions for the nut on the turbo and the screw the connects the crank case ventilation hose to the inlet. Be careful when disconnecting the hose from the top of the engine, it's very easy to break the internal clips (I broke one).\n\n\n\nAnyone have one pictures of inlet and outlet pipes vs aftermarket.

    "content": "So Ive been searching since Thursday and I can't really find any detailed useful Info on this.I know there are many threads about the BMS Meth kit and a lot of the sponsors here sell them because they work with the JB-4 and are made for our cars unlike the Aquamist which is a universal brand that many other tuners and enthusiasts use.Ive asked a few people who I thought may know more about this and the consensus is that Aquamist is the \"king\" of meth kits while the BMS kit is the cheaper route that works well with JB4.Im completely new to meth kits and have been trying to do my research the past few days before settling on one. Right now this is my situation and any recommendations and/or help anyone with experience can provide will be greatly appreciated.Im running the following performance mods right now--M-performance Exhaust-Eventuri Intake-VRSF Catless dp's-VRSF chargepipes-VRSF Race Intercooler (6' I believe)-Protuningfreaks Bootmod3 flash....so with these mods I asked around for the most consistent and user friendly Meth kit to help cool and add some power. I specifically want my car to run consistently the same and not have to worry about this or that failing because I don't have the right mixture of gas in or because Im running too much boost and so on. So I spoke with my tuner and a couple other guys that have some experience with these kits and they recommended the Aquamist hfs4 kit to me along with a moderate map they would make for my car to keep it running safe and also take advantage of the gains the meth kit will bring. Ive seen so many problems with people running pure stage 2 and PI that Im choosing to just run FBO with a meth kit and keep it as reliable as possible and wait on the turbo upgrade to see what else comes out in terms of research down the road.So if anyone here has any real experiences with any of the kits specifically the Aquamist kit; I would really appreciate the insight and help. Is it reliable? How does it compare to other Meth kits out there including the BMS kit? I know the price is more but I want the best so the price here to me is not a concern as I want to make sure quality is top notch and that its as reliable/consistent as possible.Thank you all for the help and I hope this can turn into a useful discussion comparing different meth kits for our specific cars because from what Ive seen I can't find anything on here about them (I know theres probably some stuff on it in other N55 threads but we all know our cars react differently to certain mods even though its an N55)Hope you all have a great weekend!James M.\n\nIm subscribing to this because Im doing the exact same thing.\n\nAnyone have any experience with aquamist?\n\n\n\nFrom what I gather many are using snow performance controllers when they go the bm3 route for cpu modification.\n\nI think Aquamist is the way to go.\n\nM2Dynamic- what did you end up doing and deciding on?I always used the HSF4 with my Subaru builds without a single issue. the bms is nice especially stealth tank but the quality with the aquamist and support is sensational. curious to hear your report and findings with your solution.\n\nSo did you end up with aquamist?\n\nIf I were you I would go with a torqbyte it's a better controller imo\n\nI ordered Aquamist just a week ago. I'll post photos detailing the whole install and mounting options, as I feel like this forum could desperately use with them. Not a lot of WMI install photos, so it'll be helpful.\n\nThis will be fun to see. Last time I ran aquamist was on a Mini Cooper some years back.

Here is my datahttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5c3158c4ae729b4426df1972Love some help tuning it to hit 500 plus and a lot quicker\n\nActually, not bad for the E30 OTS. One question - did you actually use E30 fuel? The log doesn't seem to be that way.A few months back, one of my friend dynoed his M2 on PS2 and pretty much the same supporting mods as yours on OTS 93OCT map and got only 400+whp (many pulls) from a conservatively reading dynojet. I posted the dynograph on my turbo thread if you want to check.For 20-30hp more power, a map with more boost to take advantage of your bigger turbo is all you need and a 3.5bar sensor. For now.If you're really shooting 500 on wheel - let me tell you straight - these two things are absolutely required 1)Meth and 2)JB4. There are no N55 PS2 seeing 500+ without them.With JB4, you can target 22psi across and use the normal OTS STG2 pump gas map for BEF (E30 map would be too high timing for your high boost). A STG2 LPFP is also helpful, but not necessary though with the meth in place.If you want a maxed out 24-25psi with E40-50, then the meth alone wouldn't be enough fueling and octane, therefore, HPFP upgrade or PI, and lpfp are required.Good luck man!\n\nSeanWRTSo...now I am confused...with BM3 aren't you able to customized your own tune or do you have to use a map and that's the reason for needing JB4? The PTF website isn't clear to me (at least I couldn't find anything helpful).\n\n\n\nI'm guessing the jb4 is for meth control?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the thread I was thinking of.https://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1562567\n\nPros of running JB4 with bootmod:On the fly map changes from the turn signal or phone app includingstock, VALET, pump gas, E85, water/meth, and race gas mapsExhaust flap control via turn signal\n\n\n\nFlash based boost tuning is possible, it just has to be developed. I ran that for a bit on my Mazda using Cobb. For a stock turbo fbo car I found the power inconsistencies very noticeable to the point where i was running a different map for each season. Ended up going back to load tune. The big turbo guys seemed to like the boost tuning though.\n\nSo if I'm reading correctly, BM3 is a load based tune?\n\n",

Assuming that yours is completely stock then yes it will be a completely stock map.\n\n\n\nLet me put this very precisely.There are only two versions (ROM as we call it) of M2 stock map from BMW throughout the M2's life.

On stock exhaust, it's barely noticeable.Also, FWIW, the flap seems to be open at first at lower RPMs, regardless of mode.  I say this because when I am sitting somewhere idling and I have it in Auto mode, the first time I push my steering wheel button to change mode, it goes to Open next. I don't hear any valve noises from the exhaust when it changes from Auto -> Open.  Press it again to go to Closed mode, and onlythendo I hear the valve make a noise and whir shut.So at lower RPMs at least, the valve is open regardless of drive mode (even in Comfort).I am guessing that with an aftermarket exhaust (using factory valve system, i.e.notthe M Perf system), it may be more noticeable... but with stock catback I can hardly tell the difference.  Changing drive mode makesmuchmore of a difference in sound, because the different drive modes are what cause it to start dumping extra fuel (for popcorn noises).\n\ntech at bmw dealership did it for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a little mod box from Berger motorsports that allows you to keep flaps open/closed and it stays that way until you change it.

Worth the price of entry in my opinion.You'd spend the same amount of money on a DP + whatever product (tune or gauge) you'd use to delete the CEL so it's really not any more expensive then the alternatives.Plus there's no smoke or smells to deal with. It really is the best option I think. Just pony up the cash. You won't regret it.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Fabspeed catted DP. Adds a very nice sound with the stock exhaust and gives you some power\\torque too (that you can really feel). It's well made and no CEL or stink. If you're pretty handy you can install yourself. If not it's not too much $ @ a shop.I'd just ensure that the jig problem that caused some misaligned brackets is a closed issue. A couple of those made it to customers and it was off by about an inch.Check the tuning forum here for a ton of info on this piece and plenty of advice on installation.\n\n1 year in on my Fabspeed catted DP.  No stink, no smoke, no CEL.  Just miles and miles of killer sound and extra power.  Best mod I've done to the car.  Cough up the dough and enjoy.\n\nThanks a lot !! Forgot to add that I'm using dinan stage 1 in my car\n\nFabspeed also uses the top notch HJS catalytic converter. This factors into the high cost.https://www.hjs.com/aftermarket/prod...onverters.html\n\nFabspeed catted dp and asd delete = great\n\nIs necessary to make chip tuning for dp is important to say this\n\n\n\n\n\nI too having been looking at downpipes, and do not want a CEL to pop up either.  I will likely put a tune on the car after the warranty has elapsed, but not at the present time. My research suggests that downpipes built using HJS catalytic converters are the way to go if avoiding a CEL is a priority.There are at least four downpipes readily available in the US that employ HJS catalytic converters:1.  Fabspeed 200-cpsi ($1395)2.  HJS 300-cpsi ($1495)3.  Akrapovic 300-cpsi ($1850)4.  Supersprint 100/200-cspi ($2432$2822)Given that I have the M-performance exhaust, which is already pretty loud with the valves open, I am leaning towards the HJS downpipe over the Fabspeed unit.\n\nDoes anyone have the fabspeed downpipe and M performance exhaust set up. How much louder did it get once you added the fabspeed downpipe?\n\nFabspeed 100% chance of no CELWagner Tuning 90% chance of no CELOr you can run Bootmod3 with any downpipes and it will suppress the CEL\n\n\n\nThe Fabspeed 200cell DP is fantastic. Expensive but worth it. I think the sound from a catted DP is better and more exotic than other options.\n\nI want the fabspeed but it seems they have a long waiting period\n\nI have fabspeed and MPE. it's pretty damn loud, especially on cold start and in a garage. Quiets down after about 30 seconds though\n\nGoing to fix the catted dp from ER as the waiting time was a wee bit Long for fabspeed",

    "content": "UPDATED: Graphs shown in post #29I drove my car 2 hours north to Allentown yesterday (in Friday rush hour traffic) because of the reputation of this particular tuning shop. Shout out to evans-tuning.com. Check out their website. They have the \"world's largest online dyno database\".This was done on a Dynapack, whereby the rear wheels are removed and the hubs are secured to the dynometer. Dynapacks are generally perceived as reading a bit higher, on average, than Dynojets. My tuner agreed with that assessment. Although, a vid exists on youtube proving the opposite. Whatever...My goal with this session was to see the delta between the stock car (with Dinan exhaust and cold air intake) and with the sport tuner activated, in my case in race mode (+4 psi). PA roads suck but we do get quality pump gas.For some odd reason, partially because I'm an idiot, I can't upload the graphs. I'll try to figure it out. In the meantime, if interested, send me your email and I'll gladly forward them to you. Here are the numbers all SAE corrected:stock: 333.4 WHP @ 6388356.2 WTQ @ 2769Dinan tuner: 362.0 WHP @ 6369407.4 WTQ @ 2844As you can see, this simple and inexpressive device is pretty badass. Gaining 30 whp and 50 wtq is substantial for a $300 boost controller.Next stop, Stage 4....will spending $6000 be worth it? We will find out in a couple of months when I revisit the dyno.\n\nCongrats.30WHP peak gain is no joke. Surprised our tiny turbo is still making that much more flow at 6400rpm with tune. I am sure the quality fuel and cold IAT contribute to the result.It makes me think Sport Tuner, targeting +4psi throughout the band, probably is making better peak power than 1544$ worth Dinantronic Stage One.\n\nExactly!!! Get a DP and the thing gets pretty squirmy. Needs more rubber. Nice to see the gains.But dyno sheets or it didn't happen!!!!!But this is the setup I have. It's serious. Good stuff.\n\nThose are some nice results!. Although S4 is worth it, the price is the thing haha.Im still going to test my Stage 1, and see the difference :P, that way I can actually compare S1 with the Sport Tuner. Keep in mind that with Stage 1 Dinan honors a discount on future upgrades, so there is that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 4 was worth it to me.  The traction control light blinks between 60mph and 80mph in 3rd gear.  The rear squirms around at pretty much all speeds now under heavy acceleration.  I really need more rubber to mitigate the added power.Also the tech that installed it for me said he later added pipes to an m4 and said it felt like my M2 (with stage 4) felt faster, for what it's worth.  Can't trust a butt dyno, but it's still impressive that you'd even be able to compare the two.\n\n30 whp and 50 wtq is pretty good, I thought consensus was that these motors are pretty much maxed out?Is it also true that the $300 sport tuner will void your BMW factory warranty if the engine lets go vs the $1500 stage 1 tuner which keeps the warranty?\n\n\n\nYup.  I'd get a catted aftermarket DP if I get confirmation that I'd benefit at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of gas were you running? 91 or 93?\n\n\n\nDude the fabspeed dp is a huge difference get a ne and the sport tune and the M2 becomes an animal\n\n",

New one will go in the same way the old one comes out, just a bit more work to get it in, a second set of hands really helps, my car was on jack stands and I used one foot and both hands to get it in as you have to push  and twist and maneuver and swear a few times until it just finds it way in.

I found someone who did it for the E series n55, but I would like verification for the m2 before I mess something up doing this.Thanks guys!\n\nI'm guessing no one?I guess if worse comes to worse I could always buy a short piece of clear tubing and zip tie it to an AN fitting and observe oil flow.I'm going to assume either no, or very minimal flow will come from the out port of the housing when the oil is cold, and nothing should come from the inlet side. But when it warms up I should hopefully have a clear indication of flow.Please correct me if my assumption sounds off, thanks again guys.",

I dont live in an area with many dynos and it seems that there are lots of variables that can affect dyno numbers.  While whp numbers are nice to know Im more interested in what it adds up to out on the road.My plan is to test each mod by timing the 60-120mph times with a dragy and be as scientific as possible.  Every time I test the car I take a screenshot of the weather for comparison sake. Runs are on the same flat road in the same direction with back-to-back pulls seperated by a .5- .75 mile slow down.  No rhyme or reason for this format it just happens that the road requires it.The first test was stock vs Dinan sport tuner in race mode.  The 60-120mph results were:Stock- 12.47 secondsDinan Sport tuner Race setting-11.25 seconds.Race setting is 1.22 sec fasterWeather 70f, humidity 38% wind NNW 2mph resulting in a slight tail cross wind.What do yall think? Suggestions & advice welcome.\n\n60-120mph is 96-193kph. Your number of 12+s with stock car is way off. Stock car does 100-200kph in 10.5-10.8s.Also, with M2 it would be even difficult for FBO and a quality flash to gain a full sec in 100-200.A TMAP based piggyback alone is not going to do 1.2s.\n\n\n\nA wagner catted DP has been added since I did this on 11/18.  I haven't done any tests with it yet but should do a couple in this week.  Been waiting on the weather to be comparable.I also shot videos of the stock exhaust.  I used a DB meter (Decibel X Pro for Iphone) to try to quantify the difference but I think it's going to be inconclusive.  The meter doesn't show much if any difference between comfort and traction mode.BTW The DP threw a code within 15 miles of soft driving.Next I will tune with BM3 OTS stage 1 followed by a CSF intercooler and ER charge Pipes and OTS stage 2.  The IC & CP S2 will be after new years.\n\n\n\nMaybe you did 60-130\n\nGuestimated loss for a manual is about half a sec, 1 sec if you change gear sloppy? So 11.2 is not that badEdit: sorry...11.2 is actualy bad for non-oem\n\n\n\nHeres some custom mapped fbo stock turbo 100-200kph times mostly from the U.K.\n\nI think if you're doing this for scientific purposes, the most important thing is keeping the conditions relatively consistent and just looking at the speed improvements. There are so many variables so don't bother comparing to other people's times, just compare to your own.I rarely see people achieve what publications report for performance metrics like 1/4 mile, 0-60 etc. By brother-in-law couldn't beat a 13.9 @ 100mph quarter mile in his bone stock Audi S4 when it was new. Motortrend apparently clocked a 13.0. Same deal with my old e46 M3  back in 2005 - I got a best of 13.7 @ 101mph bone stock (with a 2.0 60') yet the magazines showed 13.0-13.1.Don't sweat it.

Lots of information and feedback from folks who have done tunes. I use the VF Engineering stage 1 tune and have had good results, not off the chart performance but the car is otherwise stock.  You really need to define your goals, no one size fits all.  Many require a downpipe and upgraded intercooler so take a look at the tuning section and most likely you will find someone with similar goals that can give you an idea of what direction to go in.\n\nActive Autowerke flash tune gets you the most power out of the box.Bm3 gets you the most featuresYou cannot go wrong with either one",

    "content": "HiI was wondering if there is anyone in the forum that has gotten the Hex tune stage 1or 2 from VF engineering. How much of a difference does it make and is it worth buying? Is the burble mode any good lol?\n\nThis guy has some videos on it.He has some posts here as well.There are some other options for flash tuning.Sounds generally like Stage 1 doesn't add a lot of peak HP (especially on 91 oct), but the butt dyno feels the power.Stage 2 is going to require intercooler upgrade, sport cat, and think about a charge pipe.Check the N55 engine section.https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/fo...play.php?f=651\n\nStage 2 requires a downpipe (per VF). you can do without FMIC. I did a chargepipe for piece of mind. The difference vs stock is night and day. Its still a relatively conservative tune vs other options out there but it definitely makes the car come alive and is a lot of fun.\n\nAfter Break-in service ,Did stg 1, has stage 1 for 2 months and then jumped into Stage 2 after doing the downpipes with no fmic (happy person)Did intercooler and chargepipes 6-7mo's laterNot necessary for stage 2 but  downpipes...Plug n play and enjoy the ride ///Love VF-E / Hex tuningTune been on the car for over two years\n\nWhat's more aggressive, BM3 stg1 or Hex stg1?\n\nThanks for the reply. Just wanted to see the power gains. Good video by that guy as well.\n\nTuning a turbo charged vehicle not as difficult as people are making it out to be now that the ECU's firewall has been penetrated..It's matter of just turning up boost and synchronize the timing to allow for your desired style of drivability, quality of gasoline and any potential mods..Any reputable retail tune will do, VF, BM3, ect. are all the same with each having their own unique user interface and pricing..Tuning anatural aspiratedvehicle, now that's chore! And it's is wayyyy more expensive and time consuming to achieve half the results a tuned turbo vehicle can produce..I'm speaking from first hard experience from spending many weekends in a performance shop back when I had a Evo 9.and observing their operation..\n\nA consideration, and one that initially helped me to make my decision and is now making me question my choice, is that with VF/Hex it is \"set and forget\" - this is what I have now. If you want to do any additional tuning, you'll need something else. I can see in a year or two wanting more power and I will need to make another purchase.\n\nI had the VF Stage 1 in my OG M2, makes a huuuge difference.I now run BM3 on my M2C simply because they dragged their feet on releasing the tune.Can't go wrong either way. The VF folks have great customer service and BM3 folks have automated/simplified the tuning process a bit better.\n\nI'm gonna be interested in a Stage 1 tune, probably hex, when my warranty runs out. I also honestly feel that I don't need the extra power but I'd probably add it anyway.I feel that the car has problems gripping the road anyways even stock but hopefully the Michelin PS4s will remedy that to some extent.\n\n\n\nRunning Hex Stage 2 on my car for about 6 months and absolutely love it. 100% recommended.",

    "content": "I plan on going to a larger turbo, FMIC and tune.  I'd also like to do everything myself BUT the turbo replacement requires an electronic wastegate calibration and I don't have the equipment necessary.  That brings me to my question.  I plan on having a BMW dealership do the turbo swap on my vehicle while it's bone stock.  My question is, can I drive the vehicle this way 90 miles to my house?  Once I get it home I'll do the intercooler and tune.  TIA.\n\nDon't risk it just have it towed to your house\n\nExpect you could do the tune at the shop, drive home conservatively and do the intercooler once you get home. Is that an option?\n\n\n\n\n\nI was thinking (maybe wrongly) that the MAF would monitor air flow still and the O2's would check mixture and the DME would still control everything.  If I stayed out of the throttle it might be ok but all of that was guess on my part.\n\nIf I was an SA with a brain, having just supervised a big turbo install, I'd be much more concerned/likely to flag car if I saw the owner drive off without a tune than I would if I saw the owner tuning the car in the parking lot.Towing is of course an option, but just seems like a waste.\n\nCall me naive but, the \"big\" turbo is nothing more than a stock turbo with a slightly bigger compressor that creates more flow. How would driving it 90 miles conservatively cause any damage? Ask the tech who's installing the turbo if it's ok to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be fine. I have the Dinan turbo and before getting a custom tune I ran a BM3 stage 2 map for a few hundred miles, regularly hammering it with no issues.

    "content": "Enjoy the review by Autocar Magazine!:https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review...ource=20180109Five Stars (out of five)BMW's smallest M-car has been given adjusted suspension and engine upgrades by tuning firm Litchfield. Has it brought the best out the coupé?What is it?Lichfields package of upgrades for the BMW M2 is so expertly judged and so brilliantly executed that this now feels like the car the M2 should have been all along.Thats not to say BMW missed the mark with its smallest M-car. In fact, even in standard guise, the pumped-up two-door is a really entertaining machine. But the engine is short on character and on yumpy, cresting roads, the suspension just doesnt keep the mass of the body under tight enough control.Fling an M2 along a moorland road at speed and on more than one occasion youll feel the rear end go light over an undulation as it continues to rise skywards, making you worry for an instant that it might drag you off the road entirely. Its heart-stopping stuff.Litchfield is the Gloucestershire tuning company thats perhaps best known for its Nissan GT-R upgrades. Nowadays, though, the company modifies everything from Porsches and Ferraris to Audis and, of course, BMW Ms.Litchfields M2 upgrade package includes an ECU remap and bigger intercooler to lift power from 370 to 420bhp, a titanium Akrapovič cat back exhaust system and adjustable AST suspension. The kit also includes a set of 10mm spacers that help to fill the wheel arches and make the most of the modest drop in ride height.Running a little lower to the ground and with its wheels squeezed out slightly, the M2 looks better than ever.What's it like?The AST suspension is road-biased rather than being set up for the track; this certainly isnt an ultra-stiff, very uncompromising chassis. The dampers are adjustable for bump and rebound so owners will be able to tweak the ride and handling to their own tastes and tighten things up for circuit use.Set up the way it was during our test, the Litchfield M2 rides with an underlying tension at very low speeds, which matures into a very well controlled and sophisticated ride quality at higher speeds. Given the short wheel travel, the relatively stiff springs - this is a high-performance car, after all - and the rubber-band tyre sidewalls, the car dealt with an uneven and bumpy road surface quite brilliantly. Whereas some performance cars jab at a spike at your kidneys as their body skips and hops over bumps, the Litchfield M2 is fluid and composed  more so, certainly, than the standard car.Body control is also massively improved, meaning you feel so much more confident now that the car will keep its mass in check as the road crests and falls. Litchfields suspension upgrades are transformative.The usual M2 qualities are very much in check. The front end is enormously grippy, with very little inherent understeer, and the car feels light and agile. Its a huge amount of fun to thread along a winding road.Even in damp and very cold conditions, the rear tyres find good traction. Despite the uplift in power and torque, the M2 actually puts its power down to a wet road very effectively, even in second gear. The BMW M4, by contrast, delivers its torque so abruptly that the rear tyres slip long before theyve had a chance to wind themselves up, making the car leap headfirst into its own traction control safety net.The Litchfield M2 is much less of a wild ride than an M4 and better controlled than the standard M2 as well. Overall, its much more enjoyable to drive than either of them.It doesnt feel a whole lot faster in a straight line than the factory M2, but the engine does is a much sweeter thing now. It opens up from 2000rpm and pulls with such linearity right the way to the limiter, and with such free-revving energy throughout the rev range, that you would hardly believe it was turbocharged. The Akrapovič exhaust also adds some song, plus some grin-inducing pops and cracks on the overrun.Should I buy one?The BMW M2 has never felt better than this. In fact, equipped with the Litchfield suspension upgrades, the M2 might well be one of the most entertaining performance cars at this price point. At £9755, the full upgrade package isnt cheap, but if you substitute the Akrapovič exhaust for a perfectly decent Milltek item, youll pay £6361.You can have each item fitted individually, too, and if you dont want to splash out on the full kit, wed recommend fitting the transformative AST suspension right away.On sale Now Price £9755 (for the full upgrade) Engine 6cyls, 2979cc, turbocharged, petrol Power 420bhp at 5500-6200rpm Torque 420lb ft at 2200rpm Gearbox 6-spd manual Kerb weight 1570kg Top speed 170mph (estimated) 0-62mph 4.2sec (estimated) Fuel economy na CO2 na Rivals Audi TT RS, Porsche 718 Cayman S\n\nInteresting reading this since AST is my choice for suspension on the M2 Competition.MR\n\nBut the suspension in the photographs are kw v3.\n\nRide heigth drops by 2,5cm. I'm interested but how will this affect the ability to go over speed bumps?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone else running the Litchfield AST suspension?",

    "content": "Hey guys,I'm looking for a tune, but most of them i've read about seems to require additional mods such as IC, DP, etc.Since my car is leased, i'm not to keen about upgrading lots of hardware...Any suggestions? Being able to increase the exhaust burbles would be a plus as well\n\nI would go with BM3 by Protuning Freaks!  Hands down the best ecu flashing on the market today!  I got one available if you're interested!  Let me know\n\nI may be in the minority here, but in MY opinion, if you're renting (leasing) a car, then I would not modify it, since it is not yours.  With that said, with Stage 1 tune you don't have to upgrade hardware.\n\n\n\nDepends on your dealer.If you want to be safe, get a stage 1 BMS tuner and remove it before your visit then sell it once you return the car.The dealer here is cooler and does not mind car mods, we have a flash tune on the shop's M4Active Autowerke or BM3 are the most popular options\n\nMHD Stage 2 can be run on stock hardware (there is no stage 1 from MHD for an M2 as the M2 is already a stage 1 N55).This information is from MHD themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinan sport tuner....2 minute install/removal, up to 30 bhp and 50 tq....on sale right now for $230 USD\n\nI was thinking about the sport tuner, dealer can still log DME and see that you were running more boost though. It does seem like the easiest and quickest boost in kick.\n\nAs it's Leased, there appear to be two points to consider:1. Chance of completely borking the ecu/engine.2. Ability to remove the tune without leaving any trace independent of point 1.\n\nBootmod3 or bust, the first and ONLY proven Custom Tuning platform as well for us Fxx series. Their OTS maps are being daily driven by over 10,000 users around the world.\n\nWhat's the cost and performance of the bootmod3 vs the $230 dinan sport tuner mentioned above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a good that they both guarantee not to void your BMW warranty, cause engine damage, or leave any trace of their presence when the car is hooked up to a dealership diagnostic system, so you have nothing to worry about either before or when you hand the car back.\n\n\n\nIf they do all of that, you're good to go. Otherwise...\n\nthey all void your BMW warranty (drive train) if they find out. Dinan *might cover what bmw voids though.\n\nFYI you can get a sport tuner for like $250 bones from Mike at XPH. Worth it in my opinion. Bought one and ran sport +, it's not a huge increase in seat of the pants but second gear I get traction lights the whole time. Changed it back to stock and no traction lights. The torque jump is there. Yes a legit tune like BM3 will have more linear power but the sport tuner is a fun easy bump. I like that I can toggle back and forth between stock boost and more boost",

    "content": "Curious to know how people like the sound of their MPE with a downpipe. I really like the sound as is but considering this upgrade.Thoughts?\n\n\n\nCan't live without a catted down pipe. Can't live with a catless one.Call me biased. M2 on MPE and catted dp makes the all time greatest sounding turbocharged six pot - credit also goes to N55 single turbo configuration - you have one less turbo to muffle the exhaust notes\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah I have the MPE and the Fabspeed DP; valves closed its really nice and not to loud at all - apart from 5 sec after cold start - valves open and it's unreal, it's an amazing sound which gets better with heat, it gets a bit deeper.\n\nI know the MPE doesn't provide any hp gains, what about the Fabspeed DP?Are most owners going with the sport cat or catless DP?\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I go with Fabspeed over VRSF?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatless DP with MPE will be very aggressiveFor a safer choice and more refined tone, get catted DP. I recommend Fabspeed catted with HJS (these DP normally take 3-4 weeks), we have them in stock.CAUTION: This product is intended for OFF ROAD COMPETITION USE ONLY. Not legal for use on pollution controlled vehicles upon public road/highways. Please check emission laws in your state. Extreme Power House is not responsible for any misuse of this product.\n\nJust installed my Fabspeed JHS catted down pipe. Flawless fit and finish. I have the MPE exhaust and with the valve open it is loud, the burbles pop more and are louder.  It's amazing.I had checked out a few downpipe installation guides to familiarize myself with the procedure.  A walk in the park compared to installing down pipes in my N54 135i.Basically remove the engine cover and disconnect the O2 sensors, the blue coded one is the front one and has a smooth covering, the rear one is black and has a ribbed cover.  Also the front one has a clip that hold the cable in place, make sure to disconnect that.  May be easier to remove them from the holders before disconnecting.Use either ramps or a lift to raise the front end. Remove the 12, 8mm head sheet metal screws and the 8, 16mm head screws and remove the aluminum shield.Some install guides recommend dropping the aluminum cross brace, other say drop the exhaust, neither is necessary.In no particular order loosen the bottom clamp with a 15mm wrench, you may need to tap the bolt to pop the band free, it provides a great seal, undo the top band with a 13mm socket, I used a swivel head socket, but a 3 inch extension on a 3/8 drive ratchet would work, neither band is difficult to loosen.   Again loosen the clamp at the top by tapping as it too is seated very well.The last step would be to remove the nut on the top of the original cat and save it, then the bottom nut and bolt on the cat, lastly remove the two 13mm head nuts and bolts, then remove the two mounting brackets held in place by them.  The bracket that mounts to the top of the original clamp will not be used and is removed.Once the clamps are free the cat can easily be removed, the flex pipe just downstream of the bottom of the cat will move enough to allow easy removal.Once the original is off, swap out the O2 sensors, doing one at a time will avoid mixing them, a 22mm wrench or proper O2 removal tool will work.Place the new cat in place and loosely tighten the v band clamps, reattach the smaller of the two brackets loosely and twist the cat if needed to achieve the proper fit.  Use the original bottom bolt and the 13mm nut from the original top mount to secure the cat to the mount, once satisfied with fit and alignment, tighten the v bands, then the bracket bolts.Replace the aluminum shield.  Go topside and reconnect the O2 sensors, install engine cover and that's it.\n\nI know I'm resurrecting an old post .... I just got MPE installed. I love it aside from the 3000rpm drone on the highway. Will a downpipe make the drone worse? I wouldn't mind more volume and pops and crackles but not more drone (wish I could have less drone .... I know 3rd world problems). Thanks in advance!!!\n\n\n\nI'm going to have to agree withkpaso...I don't have an MPE, but with only a Fabspeed Sport Cat and the stock exhaust, I get drone at ~3,000 rpm. It's not terrible, but if you fold the seats down it's LOUD. If you already have drone with the MPE, I think it will be worse with a downpipe.Perhaps someone with both will be able to comment.\n\nFabspeed 200 cell cat and MPE here, amazing combo, do it!\n\nI will say it is the best mod that you can easily do.DP alone will not affect your car's intended dynamics, ECU still staying the original form, no harms to fuel supply.Not expensive, but gains decent # of horses and torque figures. + sounds awesome especially with MPE.\n\nI found that the Fabspeed DP matched with the MPE takes the already aggressive sound of the MPE and just makes it a bit more ferocious/louder.  I disabled ASD and it's resulted in the perfect balance.The best way to describe it for me is now it's no longer a foregone conclusion that I throw it in sport+ and open the valves.  I actually have to be cognizant of where I am and whether it would be too loud to do that or not.\n\nI went catless and its raw, loud and amazing. No regrets!",

    "content": "M2 drivetrain mod forum has been stagnant for quite a while and we clearly see why. For more power, there is M2C MSRP listed for just 10+K more. And to trade M2 in would be 20+k or so, so that you get a new car.The tragedy is - for M2 to really, CONSISTENTLY match a S55 powered M2C (up to ZCP tune) on PUMP GAS, it takes FBO+STG2 turbo.Many may think just FMIC/DP and tune would get you there or close. But really they don't. Repeatable 400+whp pulls require bigger turbo that runs cooler so you're less vulnerable to octane and temperature (IAT, In-Cylinder Temp and EGT).Stock turbo's glorious dyno numbers or Dragy 100-200/60-130 time don't remotely qualify and can't stand test of heavy use at all. 360~370whp at 16+psi tapering to 14~15psi is where stock turbo is reliably running at max. And I would stay there.Even STG1 turbo can't run 400whp reliably due to pump gas octane limit. I showed 410+whp in winter, only to see it struggling too much in spring.Been testing STG2 turbo (GP500 and PS2) since May. There are 100F hot track days and 70F cool days. STG2 is still octane limited, but clearly, any given load and temperature, the more capable turbo puts much less stress on everything else, while makes more power.At the end of the day, you will always want to tune to the octane for a given setup, rather than to max out turbo with way more octane beyond sanity.OK, above I was just explaining how you really need to adjust your expectation out of \"simple and cheap mods\". Below is what the real M2C matching package is and costs:PS2 (2500) + Turbo Inlet (200) + FMIC (500~800) + Charge pipe (200~300) + Downpipe (700~1200) + Custom tune (1000) + Labor (1500~2000) = 6600~8000 USD for a reliably running 400~420whp M2.At this point, a new M2C with better tech/interior, a modern look and factory warranty, is easily a better deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nHey sean, once again an excellent conclusion. On the engine side, the m2c is a much better choice for tuning. Get bm3 and youre running what? 500wph? CrazyBut try to shed 50kg from an m2c and put this into the equasion. This is the only reason i am not trading my m2 for an m2c.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, it will probably take 8k to get the M2C to sound as good as M2 with MPE\n\nbasically, I'm keeping my stock tune. especially since I'm in california with terrible gas. still love my car.\n\nAll very true but I guess the relevance really depends on your needs. Unless you're drag racing or highway racing on a regular basis does it matter? I struggle to get the full power of my M2 down on the street, and I expect the M2 would struggle even more so.\n\n\n\nAll I know is that I added a Dinan Stage 1 tune - the car hauls ass - no CEL and I couldn't be happier.I don't want or need any upgrade, more power or anything else for that matter.My LCI M2 is just perfect for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe M2C is definitely an upgrade if you go after maximum performance. But as most OG owners would agree it comes at the cost of looks and sound.Nice breakdown of the cost for what it takes to get 400whp on pump gas reliably.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately the question is how much power do you want?If you want to make more then the chassis can probably handle an M2c is certainly the way to go since it can easily get there.Seems like we are in the never ending hp race.Rumor is the new M3/4 may have roughly 500hp???When will it end lol\n\nI think the perfect power level for this chassis is 450 whp.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok We're starting with a 2018 M2 brand new...this is the official beginning of DiyTransport's journey to build the country's only 7 second M2.  Attached are pics of our base car specs and first round of upgrades from Pure Turbo and Extreme Power House. Our first stock run off the showroom floor was 12.85 ...yikes we have a LONG way to go. Car goes in the shop next week for the first round of bolt on installs.  Any advice or stories of your own powerhouse journey please share with us at website coming soon.  I should state that we know it's gonna take a lot more turbo and Engine mods that this first round.. this is more just fun for now with the bolt ons\n\nNot to be a smartass but I think you'd have a much easier/cheaper project if you started with a M2C...2 HPFP'sN55 gonna need a whole lot more turbo than a Pure Stage 2 in factory housing, maybe a Doc Race top mount single with at a minimum, a GTX3584RS, but more than likely, you'll need a big mama, like a GTX5020R with an 88mm compressor wheel pushing 40+psi on ethanol.N55 needs to be fully built/reinforced and have ability to rev over 9000rpm to have a fat enough power band, that 5020 ain't gonna hit till 5000+rpm, a la 2JZ-GTE, you're gonna need 1000hpDrivetrain improvements.Sticky rubber.Big diet.I'll be following cuz I got a 2018 M2 too\n\nFigured we r gonna need about 1000 hp and some good traction to break into the 7's...need to learn what I need to do to the motor and drivetrain to take that kind of hp\n\nWrong platform\n\nWhile I appreciate the spirit and will watch every step of the way, I don't think this is the right car to take on that challenge. And I say that having built quite a number of street/drag cars over the years. This car loves to be thrown into curves more than it enjoys the back straightaways.That said, I'll be subscribing and monitoring closely and wish you the absolute best of luck.\n\nGlad you're doing this. I always thought about turning mine into a drag car and taking a record, but that's a bit outside of my means. Are you doing a brake swap to fit smaller wheels with drag tires?\n\nSubscribed.Forget the naysayer I appreciate the fact that its a bit more of a challenge on the N55\n\n7sec...is this April Fools?Good luck with open deck block N55.First shoot for the F-series chassis record...MaxPSI F80 - 9.47 @ 149.\n\nAre you trying to say 7.9 in the 1/8th?\n\nGood luck man I hope you can do it but however, I'm not going to say it's impossible, but with the current mods you have I don't think it's remotely possible. Even fully built and gtrs struggle to hit 7 seconds.To make it happen like others have said, you're going to probably need to strip the interior clean, delete the ac, nav etc and bring it barebones. Then rebuild the engine and probably going to have to get a stage 3 Esq turbo, something like speedtech with a Borg Warner efr 9xxx series turbo, upgrade the fueling, and maybe even need to run a standalone ECU to make sure everything plays nicely. After that it's a matter of traction which would be difficult as the m2 can only stuff so much rubber without a widebody kit, and even with a widebody kit you'll be running into drag issues. Overall it may not be impossible but you'll certainly run into every known BMW problem there is to run into as a 7 second quarter mile I think will be faster than anyone in the factory turbo BMW domain. As the N/A m3's have seen 1000whp+ due to the higher tubing support aftermarket wise.Good luck, I look forward to seeing your progress.\n\nWrong car but subbing anyways to see if you can break 8-9s\n\nYou're starting from the wrong engine. I am not even sure you can get S55 to where you need to go. You might be better off dropping an S63 Tu from M5 in there or something...Open deck with non-keyed crank hub, you're not even going to get close. If you haven't done this basic research to start I feel there is a 0% chance you're capable of achieving the goal.\n\nWe completely know that the N55 is not the best motor to try this with But we want to keep the car an original M2...may not break into the 7's but I promise everyone we WILL be in the 8's\n\nDrag racing is so soft...Take that thing to the road course. Be strong, not weak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub\n\nThat's a pretty tall order. I don't recall seeing any BMW without solid rear axle and powerglide reaching those numbers.But hey, I'm going to enjoy watching the build of a monster, so good luck!\n\n\n\nAppreciate all the comments, suggestions, and even haters..We are going to have fun with this and record the journey in stages...Like we mentioned we fully KNOW its going to take  fully built motor...suggestions on that would be great BTW...and some drive train changes..much bigger turbo...loose weight...etc..etc..but even this first round of bolt on's should a HUGE difference than the first \"out of the box\" run of 12.85...we expect about 575 ish hp from the stuff we are putting on  it now an'd hope with the right launch and traction be able to get to the lower 11's or higher 10's",

Ambient was 60 deg and octane should be in the 94-95 range. Car ran great and felt like the power curve was progressively smooth all the way up. No sputtering, surging, in your face boost or any weird things I have been used to running the piggyback.I asked Halim to review my logs for health and he gave it. Once I do a few more adaption pulls I am going to get on the rollers and see what kind of power curve and numbers it has.Also finallygot the iPhone working right with the agent device, iPhones are such a pain in the ass sometimes blocking shit and wanting full control. Nothing on PTF end...just my phone and absolute lack of Tech knowledge.All I can say is I am super impressed with this platform so far and looking forward to moving to the next mod...Downpipe. The car feels like it had been awaken.Thanks Dzenan & Halim for all the hard work and development...... and also for being open to all the communities ideas and requests.Once i get some time on the rollers I will post resultsAlso thanks to the forum crew...tehboost for the bazillion massages we shot back and forth about the BM3 platform, to Fsociety & SeanWRT for answering so many tune questions. You guys were a big help in pushing me off the piggyback fencepost.\n\nAs I recall, last time someone posted a BM3 OTS dyno was on V3 (Dec 2017 release). Improvement was made thru recent revisions, so your results would be very informative.Good luck mate! Don't forget do a stock flash baseline run. And log all your runs. Very valuable data.\n\n\n\nAwesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNo DP yet but sitting in the garage and will dyno before installingHere are my links for the eval guys2 runs in 4th gear, 1 run in 5th gearAprox octane 94-95outside temp 62deghttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5ac1fc1cd10b4305f5db48e7http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5ac1fc3bd10b4305f5db48e8http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5ac1fc60d10b4305f5db48e9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure you have written it somewhere m2ruder, but I can't find it...what IC are you running? Also what DP did you get (cat less?). Last question for you BM3 users...is there a BM3 tune/map that would take advantage of a larger turbo at his point or does it only stack other mods (IC, DP, intake, exhaust)?  New to this stuff...so that's why all the questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is god damn strong...On 93OCT, even a little stronger thantehboost400whp 91OCT custom map.1. Log again. Include HPFP actual, and pull to 7k please.2. IAT is your enemy. Hate to say your IC seems not able to keep up.3. Repeat - you don't need DP. Told you already, many times. Log says exactly that.

Thank you!\n\nIf they are authentic, they won't fit on your standard exhaust.If you have a MPE you may be able to get some replicas that fit.Simples...\n\nI also noticed that the replicas have a more chrome look to them. I remember seeing a post where someone picked up replica tips and hit it with a dremel w/metal brush to give it that brushed look. The replicas looked pretty good after that.That person didn't have MPE though, was on a stock exhaust iirc.\n\nYea all the replicas ive seen fit the stock exhaust and not M Perf. I have a M Perf exhaust so I guess if I can get them to fit they should be aight.\n\nI haven’t check my tips but all my other M Performance parts have a BMW part number stamped on them.

Res delete is not a must.  It is plenty loud and gets louder in Sport+.  Neighbors probably hate me already, can only imagine Res delete.2. Yes, cheaper and there are a lot of black Friday deals3. bit of a drone at 60ish cruising, but then again you don't get an exhaust system for a quiet ride.4. Black Dinan Tips look nice,  MPE carbon looks nicer.5. Had this installed, requires cutting the old exhaust off.  I don't have the tools or the lift.6. cold start brings smiles ear to ear7. driving sound brings smiles ear to ear8. still burbles a little bit even in comfort, unleashed in sport+ with flap open9. see 810. I love it.  I have a black M2 and it finished the blacked out look nicely.11. If you go with Res delete, I dunno... if you rev it obnoxiously infront of a cop they may for noise disturbance haha and if you have any mods (DP) well you know what happens12. Not sure, maybe because Dinan have their own warranty on top of OEM13.  I will find out in a few years when I smog check\n\nI have the MPE on my M2, and have had both the MPE and Dinan on my M235i.On my M235i the dinan sounded better, but it didn’t fit as well as the MPE. The MPE on my M2 sounds better than both IMO.I’m not sure about the smog thing. I don’t think either is loud enough to get a fix  it ticket, even with the resonator delete; which I had on my M235i. In my city I hear a lot of stock Mustangs that are a lot louder than my car.If I were going for Dinan, I would definitely get the resonator delete, but some don’t like it. The MPE for the M2 doesn’t have the extra resonator.The MPE made for the original M2 is more aggressively made, compared to the Dinan counterpart. If you open both valves, you almost have a straight path exhaust.If I had to do it again, I might try the Dinan. It’s less expensive and less complex with no extra Bluetooth controller. It’s cool to open all the valves on the MPE but I rarely do it, except when I’m up in the mountains driving.\n\nIf you have a leased car, you can’t put a Dinan on it without significant cost at lease end.  The dealer can not CPO an M2 with Dinan parts.  I found this out when I traded in my M235i with a Dinan exhaust.  This was even though the same dealer installed the Dinan exhaust.  (The dealer is also an authorized Dinan dealer).My MPE sounds much better than the Dinan exhaust on my M235i.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hey guys, so I come to realization that Im going to keep my OG M2, love the sound and front end and the LBB, making the move to the Compeition wouldnt make sense financially, 10-15k more out of my pocket, not in the financial state to do that and eventually need spend my money on things in future.I drove the M2 C and yes the s55 felt a little more linear too endBut its muted the sound and did feel heavier although very planted in cornering. Excellent car but doesnt makes sense to get raped in a trade in.However I always wanted more power, dont need the fastest but. I love the M2 driving experience as it has more character and soul then the F generation ///M cars.Right now I have the following done to my car:RW carbon rear spoilerBmw black kidney grills and side ventsH and R lowering sport springsResonator deleteWagner catless downpipeJordan Rk tunes TUNE.Car pulls and right now its faster then an M4Now my question isBetter to do port injection or upgrade the turbo?Im leaning towards port injection, its cheaper and its oretty much full bolt on.An M2 with full bolt one and full E85, Ive seen make 470ish wheel horspower which is excellent for this. ChassisWhat else would u guys do?  Lets talk about it 🍿\n\nGet the larger Sn@il...!!\n\n470 whp on stock turbo is skeptical, to say the least.\n\n\n\nI'm 100% certain 470 wHP out of the stock turbo is impossible. If you think adding port injection to the stock turbo is the secret to breaking into the high 400 wHP realm, then I suggest you do some more research and familiarize yourself with the platform before heading down either of these paths.The reason that most N55's produce short of 400 wHP is not because of the amount of fuel / fuel quality.\n\n+1, listen to the guy above.He probably has one of the most modified N55 M2s around.I use CP injection and that won't get me to 400whp reliably, same is said with Port.The monetary amount needed to get that number reliably might be in the realm of a trade-up...slightly less if you don't cut corners and do it right the first time!\n\nWith infinite octane and fueling, stock turbo flows 400-420whp max from a happy reading dynojet in USA. That's also the number PS2 can do on pump gas and ots map.As for reliability, please don't even think about it. Whatever setup you end up with, when you push the best number from dyno or the best time in a 100-200/60-130 pull, reliability is thrown way way out of window.Reliability/consistency is the number you can reproduce at ~130F of IAT and preferably pump gas octane.\n\nThere are Dyno pulls of stock turbo F series n55's barely able to hit ~410whp with racegas or e30 mix, I think the record was ~440whp but at that power level it's just alot of heat being made, and the power is only held for a brief blip on the power band before a huge drop off.Here's the proofhttps://www.n54tech.com/forums/showthread.php?t=44144400-420 like Sean says is a number that's pretty common on the stock turbo with higher octane ~E30 or meth addition, is possible and has been done by alot of people so Infinite octane is an over exaggeration. But it probably is the \"upper safe\" limit for the stock turbo.For ps2 420whp might be the peak for pump gas and an off the shelf map, but I don't know why you keep saying it's octane limited as there have been cars with protunes getting 450whp and higher on 93 octane. This individual hit 430whp and was limited by his hpfp from going further. This is even more of an issue with a larger turbo as it flows more air and thus needs to use more fuel to balance afrs.https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1344711I've seen others hit 460whp on 93 octane before being limited by iats.So what I think is hold you (sean) and many more back is these few factors:1)fuel, here in North America we tend to have 10% ethanol as a cheap and easy Spike to increase octane to 93 and 94 (aki) ratings. This causes a strain on hpfps and possibly making the hpfp a limiting factor here. But as a byproduct we don't have as much of an octane issue as none e85 gas. For example there are many none e85 additive fuels here in Canada rated as 94 but when others have Dyno tested the fuel it knocked before fuel with ethanol in it, and tested like 91. So it could be the reason why others are seeing an octane issue due to fuel quality.2) compressor sizes there have been many variations of compressors some larger and flowing more air some optimized for spool but all under the stage 2 category. Those of use with larger compressors experience higher efficiency and can make more power at the same boost level as a smaller compressor. But the result is we use more fuel and have hpfp issues. Those with smaller compressors need more boost, i.e more pressure and that causes higher knock potential and they see octane as an issue before fuel is an issue.So if op is looking for power on the street, I would get a turbo first because you can hit probably 430whp on pump gas before the hpfp give out, and then get fuelling to push to about 450whp before heat and octane becomes a limiting factor. But if you track get fuelling first.Plus this is a pretty interesting phenomenon too if you push your car too hard on the track the ECU will think that egts are too high and cuase a fuel dump causing the hpfp to crash and result in misfires.https://www.n54tech.com/forums/showthread.php?t=37546And here's a thread about active autowere limiting power on their m2 to 370ish whp to prevent hpfp issues even with the stock turbohttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1394397So based on this if you're a heavy track guy I'd go with a fuelling upgrade before you get a turbo upgrade. This also shows that the hpfp would be a weak point especially before octane if you have good quality gas as indicated by others as well.\n\njust added a bit to the above post.But more stage 3 turbos are coming out which is great for us.\n\n@F87sourceyou've made many excellent points pretty much covering most of not all about what we can do with m2 without pushing beyond sanity.I wouldn't recommend port injection just because it's a failure point itself. Also tuning has to be adjust around it and it's very difficult to achieve consistency. With PI, almost everyone relies heavily on DME trim compensation to accommodate the extra fueling. And I've not heard a lot using that on track. In addition, PI use tank fuel so LPFP upgrade is also required when paired with Ethanol. The total cost isn't low.One thing I'd add is - we cannot just refer to 'record' numbers (RE- stock turbo 440whp) as the benchmark or the best expectation like it's repeatable. These glorious numbers take perfect conditions and 'biased' dyno, and is only for marketing.I can and probably will revisit dyno on a cooler day and show a 440-450whp on pump gas and stock fueling with 17-18psi, just to show it can so me and everyone feel happier, but at the end of day I'll still be on 425whp map daily and track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuarantee a lot of OG M2 owners felt sanest and was sold on this ca evening like the next 1M. Paying above mrsp for the car and then realized we cant make serious power, if I woulda known I woulda prob gotten an e92 m3 for half the price at the time and same performance. I love the M2 but now Im just mad paying a high payment for a car that under performs comparedto whats on the market\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "So I've searched threads and read about aftermarket exchausts vs. DPs vs. both.  I would like to know from those who have installed catted DPs a few thoughts:1) Did your BMW dealer hassle you on warranty when you took the car in?2) How does the sound compare with just a DP and the rest stock exhaust vs. no DP and let's say a Dinan, Remus or MP exhaust?3) Does having a DP without a tune really make a power difference or is it just sound and for those who have a DP installed without a tune, have you had any issues with engine performance or reliability?I'm mainly interested in this for a 2018 M2 but welcome other experiences.Thanks!\n\nIf you google 'm2 with DP' etc etc you will come across loads of vids that compare vs stock etc.You always run the risk of voiding a portion of your warranty with most mods.There are modest gains to be had with DP and no tune but tune recommended to get the most out of your setup.\n\nMy car was at the dealer for an oil change and they didnt say a word about my Fabspeed DP.  But, I didnt go in with any sort of issue.Also, I have the stock exhaust with the DP and previously it was paired with the Eisenmann muffler.  Way too loud for me with the Eisenmann but it did give it a nice high pitched sound but I prefer stock rear section since it gives the car a nice deep sound.  Bang for the buck I would do the DP all day and if you ever decide to sell it then someone will snatch it up quickly, whereas the exhaust, not so much.\n\nConsidering getting a Fabspeed or Wagner catted downpipe, and a Dinan resonator delete mid pipe myself, so I'm very interest in this thread as far as what the dealer's reaction to such parts as I'd really like to avoid voiding any part of my warranty other than it obviously not covering the aftermarket parts themselves.For any e with a DP, resonator delete and/or aftermarket exhaust manage to get a dealer to install any of these parts? Anybody with these or similar parts have any issues getting repairs covered under warranty?\n\n\n\nI first had the fabspeed catted dp installed, and that alone made a world of difference compared to stock. start ups were significantly more muscular. Felt slightly more powerful to drive too. Later had the remus cat back installed.",

    "content": "Hi allI am having some issues with my M2About 8 months ago, I decided to start modding my carStarted replacing the DP by an HJS 300 cells and my IC by Wagner Evo2 CompTuner did a remap and all went well. It was putting down 440bhp (350whp) and 585Nm of torque. Awesome!This setup ran for almost 12k kms until the moment I came across with some tuners who were able to extract a bit more from the engine with a simple LPFP and piping replacementThus, I ordered charge&turbo pipes from Forge and a Walbro450 hopping to achieve a bit moreThose parts were installed and it was the moment when the nightmare began!We put the car on the dyno and it is making less power than before with the same file.We checked the timing advance and turbo pressure and above 4000rpms both drop significantlyWe also noticed that the fuel pressure drops above 4000 rpms from 194 bar to 130 bar. The OEM target is 190 flat from 4000 rpm onwards. We decided to put back the old LPFP and re-dynoed it and got the same figuresNext step will be to put back the old pipes and see if this gets solvedWe have tested it with the spark plugs and coils from another M2 and did not solveAny clue?Currently my BMW M2 LCI has 19k kms on its odometerThanks in advanceCheersRF\n\nI'm assuming that they checked for air leaks on the new pipes?\n\n\n\nIt has to be something that happened during the install of the new parts.  Kinked fuel line?  They just need to carefully go over everything they touched.  If they were competent you shouldn't have to be going on a forum for help.  Don't take anything that they did or said for granted.  It's time to start double checking everything.\n\nself inflicted problem. if you want 500hp.. why dont you put the money on an m3?\n\nIt isn't necessarily an issue with the newly installed hardware.First of all, dyno reads differently at different times. You don't expect power gains please from pre and post intercooler piping and LPFP. No one does.The drop of rail pressure down to 130bar (1900psi) is at the edge but most of time it's not low enough for DME to pull back load. And timing falling is a direct result of the lack of octane for the boost/IAT that you're dealing with.It looks to me the software may be flawed in your particular case in the first place. I would be asking to adjust it.\n\nthanks for your repliesTuner has been asking for more fuel at the top end, but it seems that HPFP fails to deliver even the OEM target (190)I suspect that the OEM HPFP is failing. After 12k kms of being on its limit plus the new demand and more capacity of the Walbro450, it is, probably, causing this failureEven with the OEM map struggles to deliver the fuelI always fill up the tank with 98RON. Moreover, we added an Octane booster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks like a stock power curve, definitly not making 440hp at the crank with 350ish at the wheels. The powerdrop and the power peak is way too stock'ish. Wondering if the software ever has worked correct.Edit: have you ever done a baseline run?\n\nI will look for itNevertheless, my car was running 100-200kph in 9,25s.Stock map on the same road and pretty much the same temperature outside did 10,93sBoth measures were taken with M Analyzer via OBD port\n\n\n\n9.30s actuallySadly, it is not the case anymoreI guess the HPFP passed away\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "When BMW unveiled the M2 MotoGP safety vehicle in the first quarter of 2016, dealers had yet to receive a single factory example to their showroom floors. The M2 received the full suite of M Performance modifications from BMW ///M, as well as other interior and exterior custom components that were exclusive to the vehicle. With the unveiling, it was greeted with a large positive response from the community due to its performance with little to no compromise approach. With the image of the car in their minds, enthusiasts that received their M2s went straight to modifying their vehicles with many of the available M Performance parts that BMW had made available. However, the front lip was one piece that was left out of the parts list.In light of the positive response towards the front lip from the community, RKP set out to design a lip that improved upon BMW Motorsports design. With only a few of the lips made specifically for the MotoGP safety vehicles, RKPs design of the lip had to be done from the ground up.The upper portion of the M2 MotoGP lip was made by BMW Motorsport to contour the lower body line of the front bumper with recessed areas to accommodate the M Performance front bumper winglets. During the design of the RKP version, the winglets were integrated into the profile for a cleaner single piece appearance. In addition to the upper portion of the lip, there was a fixed lower splitter designed similar to the appearance of the original. The initial design for the lip was done in designworks, with all visualizations of it mounted to the bumper handled through keyshot.Once the design was finalized, prototypes of the upper lip and lower splitter were milled from PVC to the dimensions of the CAD design file.With the completed prototype, the lip was painted satin black, test fitted and final adjustments and modifications were made to ensure precise fitment to the M2's front bumper.Once the prototype was complete, tooling and production processes were all carried out in house at RKP. The upper lip and lower splitter are constructed using a vacuum infusion process, giving the pieces added strength and durability. These bi-products are a result of an excellent carbon fiber-to-resin ratio, and no voids present in the finished composite due to the vacuum infusion.The construction of the upper front lip starts off with the carbon fiber being hand laid into the master mold. Hand laying the carbon provides long term durability, a high level of finish, and a complete geometric shape with regards to the mold.After the carbon is laid into the mold, the lip undergoes the vacuum infusion process where air is pulled out of the carbon fiber, and epoxy goes in. The mold is covered with green peel ply and flow media which make a controlled flow of epoxy possible during vacuum infusion.Once vacuum infusion is complete, the finished product is removed from the mold.When the two sections of the upper lip are constructed, they are bonded together and laid on a certified flat surface. This allows for inspection to ensure that the underside of the lip is flat, so it can successfully be mated to the lower splitter.The lower splitter is a clamshell design with a Nomex cell core and integrated aluminum hardpoints. Though Balsa cores are most frequently used in a front splitter application due to being very lightweight, if external damage exposed the core of the splitter, balsa is very moisture absorbant and would cause deformation of the lip over time. Nomex is superior in this regard, as it will not absorb moisture.The end product is a solid, one piece construction for the upper lip and lower splitter respectively, using only non-commercial, high-grade carbon fiber.With the process being done in the same facility from start to finish, part validation and vehicle fitment procedures can be conducted with ease, assuring quality of the final product.The IND M2 is now headed to Sema and will be at the BBS Booth #V102\n\nDamn, don't suppose you can make a version that fits with the OEM winglets?))\n\nGorgeous lip!\n\nWhat's the deal with this golden chrome tips?What material is used here to make this kind of look!?\n\nWow, I think I need to visit the shop one day over lunch to see this in person.  Looks great.\n\nI'm sure there was a ton of R&D blah blah blah, and the materials blah blah blah and the fitment blah blah blah.  But it is still ugly (without the winglets it would be better) and probably costs $2500+ and will break just the same the first time you hit a curb.  Sorry not a fan.\n\npersonally i like the other RKP lip better. without the splitter.\n\nRKP.... Why must you do this to me?? Please tell me you do body color splitters like on the other RKP GTS Lip?\n\nLooks good but winglets have to go\n\n\n\ncan't wait to see it\n\nany discounts going on for this lip w/o the splitter? or possible sales coming for black friday?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think the steckern one will provide a noticeable benefit to the aerodynamics  that other splitters would?",

    "content": "Hey, I need your advice and suggestion on my situation. I have been running Sport Tuner with Race setting over months and finally installed CTS turbo intake, CSF intercooler and Fabspeed Catted DP. After I picked up the car this afternoon, I was stuck in the heavy traffic over 1.5 hours. Then I did the first full throttle after that, honestly I didn't feel strong power increased, a bit quicker but no whole lot. So I'm wondering the situation because the open intake causing the heat soak? Or it's about ECU has to take the time to learn the whole new setup? I only drove 25-30 miles in the traffic after picked up the shop.Any advice and suggestion would be appreciated! BTW, the intake is very noisy though but it seems like causing a bit lag during the gear change..trying to describe the situation but the overall is not very smooth of power delivery after those part installed. Really want to figure out what I should do next.\n\nMaybe sport tuner is the problem.....\n\nI'm not sure what you were expecting... I'm no expert, but my understanding is the following:CTS Turbo Intake - For looks and sound only; no performance benefitCSF Intercooler - Helps to keep IAT down, which prevents timing pull in hot weather and if you're driving the car hard; no direct performance benefit, and may increase turbo lag slightlyFabspeed Catted Downpipe - Reduces exhaust gas temperatures, and is claimed by some to give a performance bump, and by others to not really make any differenceIn any case, the Sport Tuner will have given you much more of a performance benefit than all of these bolt ons combined, even though it's not exactly 'refined'.If you want to get the most out of your choice of bolt ons, you'll need a custom tune from one of the platforms that supports that (BM3 or MHD). To be honest though, if you go with an OTS tune from one of these, or from some of the other OTS flash tuners like VF, you'll probably not be disappointed.\n\n\n\nTMAP based piggyback is type of the thing to give you the strongest perception of power bump especially on partial throttle and at low to middle rpm ranges. DP/IC/Intake makes power easier to achieve, but much less of a sensation (comparatively speaking) you will get from them.Lag is from intercooler. More precisely it's the throttle response that's effected, the air has to fill up and go thru bigger space of IC before fill your 6 cylinders. You will feel it the most on street/traffic where most of time turbo is off boost. Turbo is a pre IC thing and is not laggier. Instead it spools only quicker thanks to the less restrictive downpipe.Rough/hesitant/laggy shift is also an inherent nature of piggyback, especially TMAP only type. DME need to first adjust boost to match RPM in up/down shifting. And DME need extra time for fighting with conflicted signal from additive boost target, where all the roughness, hesitation and lagginess come from. When downpipe added to the mix, TB, WG and DV will be very busy.You'll be fine though. To make things easier without compromising power, my recommendation is to dial back to +3 or +2. Trust me your peak power will be the same, stock turbo can't handle piggyback target from 4k5 up anyway. Only down low torque surge will be less, but you already have too much of it.\n\n\n\nChange the setting of the sport tuner one level down (the one that is 3 PSI) and the car will run better.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,This is a super simple way to a better sounding exhaust without spending loads of money, and you won't even have to get your knees dirty!There's a lot of talk on M3/M4 forums about pulling flap cables and exhaust fuses, but comparatively little on this forum.After this mod, the exhaust will be louder - more as it should have been from the factory.  Also, there is non of the ECU trickery going on where the flaps get closed at higher speeds.Steps:1) Engine must be completely cold2) Put the fuse puller (held in corner of fuse box) onto fuse F146 (located in the boot under the floor - see the paper fuse chart for location) - BUT DON'T PULL THE FUSE YET.3) Start the car4) Quickly go around to the boot and pull out the fuse.The exhaust flap is now wide open permanently!  Enjoy!Vs a OG M2, the noise difference is quite large - this model of car is super quiet as standard in comparison.Vs an LCI, the noise difference less is noticeable at times, but it is still better more of the time.PS: This mod is different to putting an LCI into 'Traction\" mode, which also opens the flap.  In Traction mode, there is a lot of loud backfiring (too much IMO), which is not present with just the flap fuse pulled.  This is great, as it means it is still possible to vary the sound level of the car a bit (e.g. comfort will still have few backfires and less rev matching when driving past the neighbours).\n\nThanks for writing this up. Is the only change just to open the valves in comfort mode (i.e. to make comfort sound like sport)? There is no change to exhaust sound in sport and sport+, correct?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninteresting... is this like having cold start all the time?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot trying to burst anyone's bubble here but forcing the exhaust valve open on a stock exhaust is basically useless, the flap is open most of the time anyway so you're not going to hear much of a change. I went from the stock exhaust, to a dinan res delete, then added a sportcat and then went full Remus. I played with the valve position in each set up and it wasn't noticeable until I changed the cat.Also you don't need to be pulling fuses and do it all ghetto when there are plenty of inexpensive, non-invasive ways to control the valve, such as the bimmerlink app:http://www.bimmerlink.com/\n\n\n\n\n\njust to confirm, this mod is for M2C right?I tried it on my US M2C and it didn't work - however I did make a mistake, I started my engine for literally 5-10 seconds first, then turned it off when I realized what I did. I then found the fuse turned the engine on and quickly removed the fuse. Car was obviously still cold but maybe the turning it on for 10 seconds stopped it from working?While the fuse was out tried changing modes to sport and sport+ and I could hear a noise from under the car with each press, and the exhaust note still changed. Maybe it's a different fuse for US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhats the benefit of this workaround instead of pulling the cable out of the exhaust when the valves are open? Im happy to have the MPE exhaust so I can control this with the bluetooth controller.\n\n\n\nbump, has anyone done this with MPE?",

    "content": "Hey Guys-Need to take my OG M2 in for what I hope will be an istep upgrade finally.  CarPlay and Nav are completely missing.I have BM3, currently running Stage 2.  I have also done a few basic changes with BimmerCode.  Related?  Not sure, but doesn't matter hopefully.  I'll revert my car back to the stock tune in BM3 and undo BimmerCode changes if I can before I take the car in.So my question is if I DO get an istep upgrade, how does that impact the original tune (stock tune) that BM3 made when I first installed BM3?  Is the old stock tune something I would ever want to go back to or is that unrelated to an istep upgrade?  If they are related and it's now out of date, is BM3 smart enough to create a new \"stock tune\" based on the latest istep?Thanks for any info.\n\nDealer normally do a full scale Istep upgrade, including DME module. In such a case, your new stock tune ROM version will be updated.If you flash BM3 after that, the DME will go back to old version (pre istep upgrade). Everything else will be still the new versions though.To avoid going back to old version (not that it really matters), you can re-activate your BM3 account (open a ticket for that) so it identifies your vehicle as a newer ROM for all new OTS to be based on and new stock tune as well. Then you can flash.Be noted, normally your maps (OTS and Custom) will not be ported over to new account. Re-buying new OTS pack can cost you 50~100 USD.\n\nThanks for the reply Sean.  Appreciate your input on a lot of the threads I don't understand....But for this, if all I want to do is get an updated \"stock tune\" once I come home from the dealer with the new istep, do I really need to open a ticket with BM and re-purchase my OTS tunes?  That seems like an expense and hassle that most people would not put up with every time they got an istep update.  Just want to make sure I understand your response correctly.To clarify, I have 12/2016 ROM (MY17 M2) today.  I want to get the istep update, come home and immediately a.) take new baseline \"stock tune\" backup and b.) update to BM3 stage 2.  If I need to return to the dealer, sell the car, etc, I want to be able to revert back to the stock Tune with the 10/2018 ROM and not have to go all the way back to the original 12/2016 ROM.Thanks for any input.\n\nHi OP, there is one thing to know - OTS map also carries a ROM version just like stock.When you upgrade DME thru dealer Istep update, all the files, stock or OTS, from your existing BM3 account still carry old ROM version, unchanged. The vehicle identification process only occurs at the time of key activation. In other words, you flash any of the files from BM3 account, DME go back to 2016/12 ROM.What you need to do is to let BM3 re-identify your vehicle as a 2018/10 model, which requires a new activation, which requires a new activation key. So your new BM3 files including new stock tune and OTS will be 2018/10 version. Re-activating is like you (2016/12) sell your BM3 to someone else (2018/10), which is why it's \"normally\" a requirement that you buy a new OTS map pack.Open a ticket and ask nicely what PTF can do for youHelp that clarifies.Sean\n\n\n\nJust wanted to close the loop on this thread.  Working with PTF, they granted me a new activation code and I re-registered using a new account and set up my car as new to get around this issue.  I'm not sure it was required for my continued enjoyment, but it's done and I'm tuned again.  I in no way am declaring that YOU need to do this if you get your istep upgraded OR that PTF will jump through the hoops to do it.  I did recommend that they address it with a future release--seems like they could write a solution to check for it in code--but it wouldn't be the first time a developer told me I didn't know WTF I was talking about....ThanksSeanWRTfor the heads up on this.",

RKTunes said that tunin the car before installing those won't be a problem at all and won't affect the car. So, should I wait till I have the parts to tune or am I good tuning first then installing the FMIC and Intake?Lastly, any suggestions on other mods to do at the same time?\n\nWhy are you replacing a $1,300 sport cat with a $400 catless DP for just a few more hp?Personally, I would do all of your bolt-ons before getting a custom tune. No reason not to do it right and extract every ounce you can.\n\nI won't recommend to replace the catted downpipe to a catless downpipe. The exhaust smoke and smell is a big downside in my opinion. Just keep your current downpipe. I now have the Wagner 200 cell installed with MPE, no cell and so much more happier with the sound comparing to my previous M2 with catless wagner..\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not only the smell on the outside but also the smoked exhaust when going on full throttle. A M should not smoke when you put your feet on the pedal.\n\nForget the eventuri, keep your HFC, go with a panel filter and a do88 big pack.",

    "content": "Eventuri leverages their experience in manufacturing high quality air flow components using an approach that prioritizes attention to detail and optimization of function. Eventuris passion for BMW cars specifically began over 10 years ago, when the managing partners worked with BMW performance and tuning throughout the UK. Today, IND is proud to show M2 fans a preview of the Eventuri M2 air intake system.Eventuris M2 intake solves several challenges simultaneously, first by routing a front-facing air intake scoop directly into the M2s air filter, and also by addressing a difficult OE BMW packaging arrangement that positions the breather tube and MAF housing quite near to one another. Eventuris dedication to detail created a unique MAF boss design that is specifically intended to interfere with airflow as little as possible, maintaining an extremely low profile inside the carbon tube. This ensures an excellent flow of cool air directly to the air filter, and also a very smooth airflow within the intake tube itself. Because Eventuri uses no universal parts each bracket, plug, and clip is made specifically for the M2 making the entire intake assembly a direct and perfect fit to the N55 engine.Eventuris intakes are made from Carbon Fiber, creating not only an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that has a low level of thermal conductivity for the best possible heat management within the engine bay. The overall design process focuses on maintaining a smooth, laminar flow of cold air to the engine by optimizing every bend and internal feature of the intake piping. Eventuris unique air filter housing also creates a large captive volume beyond the air filter, and has a smooth radius to provide the best possible airflow into the intake tract.Our video below demonstrates the airflow through Eventuris intake system:\n\nI swear I hate this company.

We pulled the lighting switch and did the mode to the lower left hand switch. I noticed that both switched have the possibility of working but we just did the bottom as per the M3 forum.Did the coding. When the switch is activated the rear fogs come on (looks like super bright break lights) but also the front headlights did too. We in Canada have DRL's so this is not a big deal. Just wondered if anyone had seen these same results.https://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1023817This is the thread that I followed:https://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh...d.php?t=877278The first thread has 2 lines less coding and I wonder if this has something to do with the fact that the front lights come on with the rear fogs.FEM_BODY / 3060 LCEMaster 1C / NSL_Verbaut = VerbautREM / 3063 LCELampMapping 2 / Mapping_Nebelschlussl_L_output = nsl_lREM / 3063 LCELampMapping 2 / Mapping_Nebelschlussl_L_Function = nebelschlusslichtREM / 3063 LCELampMapping 2 / Mapping_Nebelschlussl_R_output = nsl_lREM / 3063 LCELampMapping 2 / Mapping_Nebelschlussl_R_Function = nebelschlusslicht\n\nYes it's completely normal. The front and rear fogs in any bmw will only work if the headlights are manually turned on or set to auto. If in auto, pressing a front or rear fog button will activate the fogs AND the headlights. No way to make them turn on by themselves AFAIK.Also, I posted an easier rear fog mod DIY on our forum a while ago:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1450178Unless you're replacing the entire switch the light panel does not need to come out. You can just pry the button out with a trim tool.\n\n\n\nJust went ahead and did this.  I can't wait for the next tail-gater!\n\nEasy, great mod.

    "content": "Since the Dinan Big Turbo has become relatively affordable ($1749.00 with no core charge) and it's such an easy swap compared to \"Stage 2\" which requires removal and modification of turbofold, I decided to go ahead and purchase and see what kind of gains I could achieve.  My main goal is to be able to hold 18-19psi till redline on BM3 Race Gas Tune.The Dinan Big Turbo is simply a stock EWG M2 turbo that has been machined to accept a larger, more efficient compressor wheel, the turbine wheel is factory stock and therefore does not require removal and modification of turbofold for larger turbine wheel.  Removing and replacing the turbocharger is not difficult, it is time consuming however.Dinan turbo was delivered yesterday and I immediately pulled the compressor cover off to get accurate measurements of the inducer and exducer compared to stock M2 turbo...I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was larger than I was expecting.  There seems to be some misinformation that the Dinan Big Turbo is very close in size to the EWG turbo, not the case, 4.5mm increase in inducer and 6.7mm increase in exducer is not an insignificant increase in compressor dimensions.M2 Stock Turbo:Inducer 48.0mmExducer 65.8mmDinan Big Turbo:Inducer 52.5mmExducer 72.5mmAs soon as I install, I'll tune and dyno\n\nAwesome!  What else do you have aside from the turbo?\n\n\n\nNice!Still waiting to get my stg2 turbo installed, going the Dinan way and it would had been in place weeks ago...Wow how rough/thick the original wheel is compared to the Dinan one. Just the shredded weight must make a difference.Since I still have the turbo sitting I measured the induser on theTTE 550 turbo: Inducer 57.0mmLooking forward to hear your feedback on the car after the turbo-swap!Are you swapping out the turbo inlet pipe while you are at it too?\n\n\n\nOP, thanks for sharing these info. I was too afraid of messing it up to take compressor wheel out when I got Dinan last year LOL. I really accurately measured the inlet diameter (52mm for Dinan and 50mm for M2 stock), rather than wheels themselves.Maybe truth is at the half way in between - stock inducer is 49mm (my measurement 50mm vs yours 48mm), Dinan is 52mm (3mm larger). Which is already impressive because EWG is only 3mm larger than PWG (46mm).Now about Inlet Pipe - one thing that probably would make you reconsider this mod - stock plastic pipe is 1.875\" (47.6mm), would be even choking EWG stock (49mm) a little bit. Let alone your 52mm Dinan compressor. Pure Aluminum Pipe is 2.225\"(56.5mm). See below picture.Option one (cut from stock pipe) from Pure is only 125USD, not that hard to retrofit from stock plastic pipe. Option two entire assembly is 300+USD. I'm highly recommending this mod given your desired boost level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI see you've found a way to handle your M2c itch lolLooking forward to this!\n\nYou'll be happy with a bigger turbo. The common misconception/saying is that the N55 runs out of steam/falls flat after 5500. We all know that the stock turbo is the culprit, not the engine itself. With the addition of a DP, this is one rev-happy engine, easily supplying low-end grunt, mid-range punch, and high-end pull.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know i recently had a dinan turbo put in, and i was looking at my stock turbo,And ya know  it didnt look as craggly as the one in the top pics?Idk maybe they refined it in the later models?(i have a 2018)\n\n\n\nsubscribed!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow did you install the turbo from the top of the car or bottom?

    "content": "Hi,Just wanted to see if anyone has the same issues as me.1st gear sometimes doesn't full engage.  It is half way in and is stuck in this position until you continue pushing and release the clutch slightly and give gas for it to pop in fully.Elsewise, first gear pops out completely.Only happens from complete stop.Tried reducing clutch stop to just foam only but no fix.  Before I had it with no washers anyways.Had three track days but no grinds to gears during those sessions.Read a few cases from 2 and 1 series that are similar but no exact details to fixes or issues.\n\nYeah I had experienced the same thing you're describing, but with second gear rarely first (I also have the BMS clutch stop). What I did to go around this issue is either force it in, or release pressure (allow it to go back to the neutral gate (say between 1st or 2nd, 3rd or 4th, 5th or 6th) and reengage and it seems to fix it.I had the same issue with my old EVO X and it was really bad at locking me out of gears, the solution was a \"transmission fluid cocktail\"  here's a link to what I bought:https://www.maperformance.com/produc...ishi-evo-x-gsrSo i'm thinking maybe the transmission fluid may be a cause of this weird lock out in the m2, hopefully we can have some more imput on this and maybe people testing out different transmission fluids vs. stock.But anyways I've only had it happen very rarely and if it does it's going from 1st to 2nd, and no grinding.\n\nI am having the same exact issue. First is not fully engaging at times from a complete stop. It will go half way in and if I let off the clutch I get a chattering sound. Have to take it out of first and back in again. This happens intermittently so I am just monitoring it now in case it gets worse. I know if I take it in to the dealer I will never be able to recreate the problem there so I am just living with it for now. I have 5000 miles on the car and clutch stop installed. This just started happening about 100 miles ago and I have had the clutch stop for a few thousand miles\n\nI feel like every manual car I’ve had, has had this happen. Doesn’t happen often. Don’t think I’d worry much about it unless it happens consistently.\n\nFor my part, have not had this happen on any MT. Currently have ~4000mi on my '18 LCI and while I don't find it the easiest/best shifting car I have driven, it is currently working as expected.I would keep a close eye on the issue and work to find a way to reproduce when in for service. If you get info on cause/fix, please do post.\n\nHaving had a couple of BMW MT cars now, if it doesn't want to go into 1st, there are two sensible* options: 1. keep the clutch disengaged and pull the lever back into 2nd, before pushing forward again into 1st. 2. go back to neutral, fully engage and disengage the clutch and try again. In both instances, 1st should then drop in without a problem.*the 3rd option is to just force it home. This leads to wear in the shift linkage and the gearbox can object too leading to a general reluctance to go into any gear...\n\n\n\nGoing to take it to the shop for troubleshooting today.  Going to change tranny fluid, tighten tranny mounts (running Rogue Engineering ones), check on forks and bleed clutch.  If not I will need to have a battle with dealership for warranty.  Issue has gotten worst after last track day end of Aug.  It would be once every 1-2 days before now it happens at least 2-3 times a day!\n\n\n\nI don't think having regular lock outs and gears popping out is anything normal or acceptable.  This is daily occurrence for me and has been getting worst.  Regardless, I would still trust my regular mechanic's insight more than any BMW tech.  With obvious fact the dealership will likely try any way possible to avoid warranty work.Checked clutch and line which had no issues, so this is not likely a clutch stop issues (can't say for those many spacers)Didn't do tranny fluid in the end as the mechanic said to do it last in case I needed to bring it back to dealership for inspection.Forks seemed ok.Only issue found was that the tranny mount was loose on one side.  Of course, we had this tightened and gears have not had any issues from last night to my commute this morning.  Will need a few more days to confirm if problem is gone completely.If this becomes the fix to the lock out/ gear popping out issue then the tranny mounts are the culprits of gear issue.\n\n\n\nNo worries, either way regardless of how credible either of these mechanic could be, it won't matter in my scenario because of one simple point.  I am having a serious 1st gear issue that is perceivable and my mechanic is willing to troubleshoot with me instead of shrugging me off saying that the transmission is like that.  For that, it already means more to me than whatever credentials a mechanic might have.I have also confirmed that a slighty loose tranny mount was causing the lock out and popping out to be more frequent.  The situation has gotten better after tightening.Wouldn't a more constructive conversation be that the mounts and the alignment of the fork or even how tight the tranny mount is, causes the lock out and or on another point maybe the stiffer RE tranny mounts don't work well with the car?  Since from comments of others, the lock it doesn't seem to happen when the car is relatively low mileage.\n\nI agree it is more than annoying it is a hindrance to driving the car and should not happen on a modern auto. Mine also happens at least twice a day and thats just to and from work and the gym with lots of stop and go. I feel better reading that this is normal behavior but sure doesnt seem like it should be normal and it did not happen before the 5k mile mark for me.\n\nthats why I always advise against clutch stops, they ruin your transmission, known this for years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry 2 first then 1. Old habit my dad taught me. Something about lining up syncros. I forget.\n\nThis happens to me maybe once every 2 months, so I'm not too concerned yet, but I'll definitely keep any eye out.\n\nThis happens to me in my 335i as well. Annoying. This never happened to me in my E36 M3s I've had.\n\n\n\nYou know what I've been thinking, maybe this first gear issue could be associated with the low speed first gear lockout the transmission has to prevent you from accidentally downshifting from 4th to 1st, or go into first at a speed that is above ~20km/h (from what I've noticed) Which in both cases prevents over revs, and engine damage. This may be causing you guys some issues, I'm not sure how this mechanism works or if I'm correct. But from me trying to down shift to 1st when I'm driving at a  bit speed too low for second it seems to lock me out so I'm assuming there is such a mechanism in place. Maybe some one can chime in about this.More context:I've noticed that the m2 has a reverse lockout when you staring moving forward that prevents you from shifting into reverse, it also has a similar feature for first gear, but instead of lockout when moving it is a \"\"low speed lock out\" that locks 1st out from being shifted back into at speeds ~15+km/h. So it allows a shift back into first at anything below a set speed unlike reverse where as soon as you're moving it's instantly locked out.",

    "content": "Purchased the Frequency Intelligent 200 cell catted downpipe from Extreme Power House. Got around to installing it at the same time as Wagner Comp II. Made sure to get some initial install impressions without tune. My car has the MPE.The cat is interesting.. I wonder if it is actually a 200 cell. It is very slim. The O2 sensor bung has its own mini catalytic converter on it. Slick way to avoid a CEL.It's pretty. Not that you'd ever notice this when it's installed but finish is absolutely top notch. A clear winner in this regard. Quality welds.It's very loud. Cold start is straight up obnoxious and a huge problem. Make sure you turn this off in your tune if you can.Exhaust burbles are out of control--simply too much for daily driving. Again, perhaps use your tune to get rid of this. This DP will give you incredibly noisy and jarring burbles.Installation was quick but had a few head scratchers. It comes with a two bracket arms welded to it, one of which seems to connect to nothing even when using the supplied additional bracket piece. Could be for other non-M2 N55 cars. The other arm bolts to your transmission-mounted stock DP bracket as expected. The DP doesn't need two hard mounting points--one is sufficient. But it is interesting it comes with generic hardware.I can now hear the turbo much more both in spool noise a higher pitched whistle at low rpms/idle. People will think your car is broken I think. Can't emphasize enough how the stock DP is limiting the noise from the turbo. There's a lot going on there and you get to hear it when this downpipe is installed.The V-band clamp is a funny item. This part (18307620349) includes a ONE-TIME USE metal crush gasket. Most DIYs don't even mention this piece. Do not re-use your stock one. I don't understand how people on this forum are installing their downpipes without them. They WILL leak without it--or at least it is very unlikely you'll get a good seal with just a vband clamp.When you do this install, do yourself a favour and pick up a new pre-cat gasket ring 18307581970 as well as the above mentioned crush gasket.There is some minor smell. This of course is the smell of power.Throttle response is noticeably improved. The motor wants to pull hard a little closer to redline than it used to. Of course BM3 fixes that and it pulls all the way now without hesitation. But you will get a nice bump with just the DP.So should you go with this or Fabspeed? I think it's probably a toss up. I went with FI as they guaranteed no CEL and I think I see why with the little O2 bung cat. I think the design is a little nicer as well. However I will say the FI is probably raspier based on videos I've seen of the Fabspeed. Once boost hits the DP its a very raspy initial tone which then gives way to a roar that's similar to all other downpipes. Should you go catless? Hell no you drive a BMW not a busted civic. Put a proper cat in there and don't annoy people in traffic. The tradeoffs aren't worth it.Ultimately I think FI is probably the more aggressive of the catted DPs. Fabspeed is a nice balance. The HJS Euro 6 cat is probably the best bet if you want OEM-like fit/finish/sound/smell/etc. If I were to do it again I'd go HJS.\n\nGood looking piecehttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1411658\n\ndid you happen to get anymore pictures of the down pipe? also keep us updated on a CEL!\n\n\n\nGet some videos if you can! Theres not much on the FI catted downpipe here.\n\n\n\nCongrats OP and thank you for the review\n\nAny CEL issues to report? I can't find any information on this dp even on their website it's hard to find but they mention they offer it. Also, where did you see they guarantee no CEL because on their site they say\"To attain a higher and louder level of sound performance with our exhaust systems,Ultra High Flow Catless Pipe is recommended. Semi-Cat is included with all Catless pipes.Local laws and regulations governing the use of exhaust systems differ from country to country. This product should only be used on roads or venues where allowed by local law.We can NOT guarantee \"NO CEL\" with this unit because every car has different emission specifications depending on the country.Racing 100 Cell / Sport 200 cell catalyst is available as an optional component\".\n\n\n\nLook awesome the downpipe. I just ordered the Wanger 200 cell downpipe. I won't go catless anymore. Did it on the previous M2, the smell, smoke and burning your diffuser are things that shouldn't be on a car from €90.000... So only sportcats from now!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Original Post By Jenny on XPH Blog.Hey Guys! Todays topic is going to be on our visit to the Remus Sport Exhaust Factory in Graz, Austria! Remus had invited us to join them in attending the DTM race in Spielberg and it was INSANE!! There were thousands of people, amazing cars, and even better drivers! Remus is also going to be the largest sponsor for the DTM race come Fall of 2019! Were beyond thankful for the opportunity to see their factory, meet their people, and see their beloved country! From the hospitality to the excitement of the events, everything was fantastic! Lets just start right into our first day in Austria!When we arrived at the factory we were greeted by all the different department managers. We chatted a bit getting to know everyone a little better and then we started on a factory tour. Now let me just say, Remus is a huge company with a total of 1000 employees. All exhausts are made 100% in house starting from R&D to design, testing, production & quality control. All made in Austria!As we were walking through out the factory we got to see REMUS staff working hard on the job. We saw the pipes being sandblasted, the metals being laser cut, and the employees hand polishing and preparing shipments. They have over 250 staff members just in the REMUS factory itself! Even though some of the parts are machine made by state of the art laser cut robots, there are some tasks they still need an actual person to perform or oversee.REMUS inventory space is huge, It is about the size of a Walmart just to compare for you! REMUS exhausts are also made out of stainless steel and titanium. They start with raw material that gets molded and cut all the way to finished products being packaged for shipment all within the same factory. There is no labor or material outsourced outside of Austria and Germany to ensure top Remus quality.R&D DepartmentWe had the opportunity to see the Remus R&D department and got lucky enough to hear a BMW F90 M5 competition exhaust before its even been released! All I have to say about that is SHOTS FIRED!!! The video speaks for itself! We also tested their newest product which is the valve controller that we will have a full video on next month.Exhaust Drone TestThe last step in design is to test the exhaust on Remuss own in house track where the car is equipped with high tech sensors to catch any exhaust drone. They will race the car back and forth multiple times in different weather conditions trying to catch any imperfection. If caught, the product is immediately sent back for a revision.Sound RoomThe highlight of the entire tour for us however was getting a chance to see REMUS $12 million dollar sound room thats so quiet and still, you could feel your own heart beating! As far as we know, none of Remuss competitors have anything like this in house! To top it off, there is a full dyno set up inside as well where they test every single product they manufacture before releasing it to the public. Not only is REMUS looking for the best sound, but also the maximum amount of power that can be gained from an exhaust upgrade. Staying true to their slogan, when sound meets power.Something that some people may not know about Remus is that they manufacture OEM exhausts for Mercedes AMG, McLaren, Bentley, Aston Martin, Ducati, etc. They have over 700+ employees in their Sebring factory alone (the OEM part of Remus). We did have the opportunity to also tour the Sebring Factory which was amazing, but unfortunately no photos or videos were allowed inside.After we toured both factories we headed off to Spielberg to watch the DTM race at the Redbull Arena! All 6 AMG cars were running Remus Exhausts! We got to spend our days at Remuss private lounge where the food was delicious, the service was on point, and to top it off one of the AMG cars got 3rd place!Thank you for reading about our experience at Remus and we hope you enjoy the video trailer we made of our tour and all of the pictures! Again a special thank you to Remus because we cant thank you enough for the hospitality that you showed and for an experience of a lifetime!We will post pictures of the DTM race later, but here is a fun video to watch until thenSandblasting - Before & After ComparisonExhaust Valve Control TestingR&D Department - Studying & Measuring Stock Exhaust For Areas Of ImprovementMore Pictures Of The Sound RoomMore Pictures Of The Factory\n\nLove my Remus exhaust!\n\n\n\nI was informed that i misspelled Graz.Sorry about that, all good now.\n\nReally cool.

You'd probably have to reweld the exhaust back together since the pipes can't be clamped back together due to the identical thickness. Also, It's a Dinan part and it makes the car sound better. Just leave it.\n\nIn your opinion when I need to sign if the car was modified does this qualify as a modification? I believe by modification they mean something to the engine or transmission that would void the warranty. The MPE doesnt have a resonator so I imagine it is no big deal.\n\nI doubt they'll put it on a lift to check for trade in.

But aside from that gawdawful racket that the car makes at idle when cold, I've noticed a really loud resonance around 2800-2900 RPM when under load.  It's worse when cruising in 6th (about 76 MPH).  It is not related to the flaps being open or closed with the MPE.I've only got 1000 miles on the car, and it may be getting just a smidgen better as the car gets broken-in.

Putting it in comfort eliminates it. Not sure how much that will help w/the MPE.\n\nMine did until I got rid of ASD.  Now it is quite.\n\nI've had my car (has MPE) a year and a half and it still drones in that rpm range.  Seems like coding ASD out should resolve the problem at least to some degree.  GL.\n\nI had my M2 for about 6 months prior to installing an MPE. The MPE definitely adds a noticeable drone at that rev range. There are two \"remedies\":1. Code out ASD.2. Reinstate the resonator (the stock exhaust has one, the MPE does not). I have not tried this myself, but I have seen other forum members claim that this helps.Bear in mind, if you perform no. 2, it means modifying both the stock exhaust and the MPE, making it difficult/impossible to put the stock exhaust back on the car and resell the MPE.\n\nThe drone is mainly caused by MPE.AsNathObeaNsaid turning off ASD helps a bit but to completely eliminate it you would have to add a resonator. Doesn't need to be from the stock exhaust, any good quality aftermarket resonator will do.\n\nI have MPE with stock resonator added back and ASD coded out.  It still drones.  I don't know how it compares without the resonator however\n\nIf you're up for the challenge, you can add back some of the deleted sounded deadener..Sound deadeninghttps://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1228618\n\nAfter hearing this exhaust in person, drone combined with the cold start rattle led to me get the fabspeed sport cat combined with the stock exhaust system. Drone is extremely minimal.\n\nThanks everyone for your comments.  I had already coded ASD off (at least I think I did...) as one of the first things.\n\n\n\nTry adding a sport cat...you'll loosen your teeth at 3,000rpm, lolHave almost 7,000kms on my LCI now and have had MPE, Sportcat and ASD disabled since new - so no reference as to what is like stock.  You get used to how to drive the car so it doesn't stay in the \"drone zone\".  Just pin it!\n\n\n\nThe drone is so annoying,\n\nI got used to the drone (2800- 3500 RPM). Doesn't bother me anymore... except on the highway... WTF Bmw???\n\n\n\nLet me tell you there is NO drone  compared to my upgraded turbo N54 135i I had before..I just got ASD coded back in because of istep update and noticed how more anoying it sounds, we get used to things and they bother us less or more with time.I think MPE + ASD Off is really reasonable in terms of sports car with special order loud exhaust..\n\nCode it out ASD = no drone on mine\n\nI have the MPE with sportcat, I did not notice drone untill I disabled ASD. I don't understand how people here are saying they have no drone after disabling ASD, ASD and drone are two different things, you can't code out drone.\n\n\n\nWell the asd would only enhance the drone sound wouldnt it, two waves hit each other and the amplitude is increased\n\n",

    "content": "Seems VF Engineering, their supporters and detractors have been silent as of late.  Love my Hex Stage 2 tune in my PE M2, curious as to the silence. That's all.\n\nWe too busy driving enjoying the hex stg2 tune ....\n\nAhhhhh, that explains it! TY!!!\n\nI was wondering the same thing TT.  I researched tuning for my M2 and had landed on VF.   Being the conservative person I am, I always wait a good while before jumping to make sure the product bugs are worked out before jumping.    As u noticed, I have seen no activity n on there thread and was hoping it wasn’t anything serious.\n\nI think bm3 has stolen a lot of the thunder from other tuners...\n\nI've also been watching for more information on VF's HEX Tune.  It seems to me that the vast majority of their customers are satisfied.  I've been a member on several other forums and typically it seems that you'll have a handful of people that take the time to report positive experiences.  However, if a product is bad or there is a problem, people will be highly motivated to post.  Some times silence is a good sign.  My conclusion is that the HEX Tune just works...  With no major issues, must customers aren't motivated to post--they're more motivated to go drive the car!\n\nI have the Hex Stage 2 now for 6k miles and before that had the stage 1 for 3k miles. It's awesome definitely loving it.\n\nAny hex stg2 guys going on track with their cars?\n\nI am using stage 1 and very happy with it, have had it for about 5,000 miles and 8 track days and no problems at all.  I will go to stage 2 at some point when I get around to doing the CSF intercooler sitting in my garage and I break down and get a downpipe. I agree with the post above, we tend to not post to threads to tell everyone a product works as advertised.  We are all quick to post when there is an issue so silence is a good thing on these threads.\n\nDuplicated\n\nRisk being categorized as a 'foe', (people knowing me know I'm sometimes a foe to just every vendor), I'll say this.Do this if money is no issue - buy BM3/MHD license to log HEX. And compare it to BM3/MHD OTS for yourself.Or dyno HEX map before and after. I had a VF dyno thread if you check. And I also logged HEX and saw their approach - well it's up to your taste and how much you're familiar with N55 tuning.Not until then can you tell anything meaningful. But once you do that, you'll instantly know which way is more sustainable and which way keeps real fun going.Why haven't you seen meaningful discussion about HEX? All depends on how much their users understand the tuning. \"This is quick!\", \"what a beast!\" and \"blow me away!\" are not meaningful data feedbacks. You'd get that from a TMAP based piggyback as well. If you're used to comfort mode, you'd even get that from a stock car switching to sport+. What you get is more drama than power.I guarantee you, once datalog unfolded, tons and tons and tons of dissatisfaction and requests for improvement would be reported. Vendor wouldn't allow that because to them R&D is over, project car is returned and they already move on to something else. There is no budget to handle that.There is no doubt VF has great tuners in house. But in this tuning business, tuners are only as good as data feedback, a good map is all about continuous improvement. No one, absolutely no one can hit it right with just their shop car however they test it. MHD and their tuning supplier already had been testing their M2 shop car for a long time before moving into global beta testing which lasted nearly another half a year. And even at official market launch, they admitted it's still a bit of rush and followed up later with many updates. And updates are continuously pushed. And I don't even need to mention BM3 in this regard.You can do it quick and one size fits all and market it as \"most validated product\" while in reality having spent way less 'validating' time than the top competitions do, but all you make happen is that either much potential is left on table which M2 doesn't really have, or just not everyone is making as much as HEX shop car does.Truth to be told, it's been almost 4 years since F platform first became flashable, but the tuning for a simple FBO pump gas configuration hasn't been perfected yet.\n\n\n\nJust installed stage 1 hex tune this week.. still getting a cold start and \"gts start up roar\" is non existent.. one of the main reasons i purchased the tune was to eliminate the cold start... tried reflashing again as per technical support.. anyone else have familiar issues with cold start? File im running says v203\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a friend. What sold me on Hex is that I could set it and forget it. I have a DSM with ECM Link and a speed density set-up (540hp) - that's a fully customizable arrangement via laptop for those who don't know. I wanted my M2 to be kicked up a little in power, but I did not want to have to horse around with anything ECU-related and Hex has allowed that.Last weekend I spent about 7 25-minute sessions on the long course at BIR in MN. The outside temp was too cold (low to mid 30s F) with mist on Saturday and very light flurries on Sunday, so this wasn't a test of Hex's ability to handle high temps, but I did reach just over 150 mph at the end of the mile-long straight before turn one time after time. The tune handled wonderfully.Before the event I was getting misfires at 9.5k miles so I changed plugs and that resolved the misfires. I am still not sure why this happened - don't know if it was tune related or not since it missed with the tune and stock (after returning back to stock).If I ever want more horsepower, I'll likely feel like I wasted my money on a non-customizable tune when I buy one of the other popular tuning options. Since I could corner hard this weekend and go full throttle without spinning the rears on just the 4Ss (i.e., not even race rubber), I can imagine that someday (after suspension mods) I'll be looking for more horsepower.The only additional thing that I wish Hex had is the ability to generate a log of the parameters.\n\nI've seen some users on this forum talk about the VF stage 2.5 tune.  Would someone mind explaining this?And another interesting question regarding some of the other folks' desire for custom tunes...  @VF-Engineering :Can I re-use my M2 hex cable for another one of my cars?Or once I decide to custom tune my M2, I'm SOL and the money I paid for the cable / tune gets toilet flushed?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I don't punch it until the M2 warms up.\n\nI put the car in sport only after fully warmed up, otherwise it takes longer.

If it only remapped the throttle pedal then it wouldn't matter but since it creates all those sweet noises through the exhaust it must do something with fueling and timing. That still shouldn't matter because I don't go anywhere near full boost while warming up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInto Sport immediately on startup.

    "content": "I have a 2018 M2, and I'm wondering if I could get some opinions on how best to increase/improve exhaust sound?While I love how it sounds right now, I wouldn't mind if it was a little louder and more aggressive.Not ready to spend $3,000 + for the MPE... I also don't want to piss off the neighbors (well, not too badly)My son, who's 19, suggested I put in a Dinan Resonator Delete Kit... about $266, plus installation.Does this improve the sound noticeably? Anyone have it and care to give me their feedback? Negatives?Alternatives?Thanks in advance!\n\nA catted dp is the most affordable and cost effective mod to the exhaust you can make. It'll make it louder and deeper, and unlike an exhaust it'll provide some performance gains. A lot of companies make them, I have a Wagner. Fabspeed is one of the other popular ones.You can do the resonator delete kit at the same time as DP install very easily.\n\nA shop near me says he can put in a valve, which would remotely open and close the standard exhaust.That way, it could sound loud when I want it to, and if I want it quieter, I press the button on the remote and it would return to standard exhaust... anyone heard of or have a system like that?He quoted $1500.\n\n\n\nThe stock exhaust already has a valve.  There are several way to control it if you want.  +1 on the catted DP.  You'll get improved sound, volume, power and responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni vote catless down pipe, but you'll need to get a tune to cancel the check engine light. sport cat is my second vote. no tune needed.oh and that $1500 valve is most likely an exhaust bypass installed just behind the cat. kids in civics used to put those on in the early 2000s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution Racewerks Catless DownpipeOEM Exhaust Muffler ModResonator delete, replaced with V band Straight pipe.\n\nDownpipe will be the most affordableCheapest would be $249 for the VRSF\n\nI agree with everyone saying HFC or Catless downpipe.  I had the Dinan exhaust and res delete and wasn't a fan.  Even with the stock downpipe it drones a good bit at highway speeds.  Had the resonator welded back in and it was better but still not great.New downpipe and maybe some new exhaust tips will make your exhaust look and sound a lot better.  Then save up for a nicer exhaust, there are a lot of good choices and you could probably snag a used one for around what the Dinan costs or may just a bit more.  I have the FI exhaust and absolutely love it, fit and finish is miles ahead of the Dinan unit.  I get a lot of positive comments about it at AutoX and track day events.",

My buddy has a new m4 with m performance exhaust. It sounds pretty sweet in person. Kind of the ripping metal sound. It's just different, but both are good imo\n\n\n\n\n\nActually surprised how well the M2C sounds compared to the M2, with the valves open.  Plus it is the euro opf muffled version.  Not the drastic difference it is portrayed to be.  Interested in a US model comparison, as some are saying the exhaust is a lot different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSound preference is such a personal thing.  I grew up admiring classic American muscle, like the Bullitt Fastback Mustang, and Italians like the original Ghibli, Miura and Daytona.    But if you grew up admiring the whole Fast & Furious scene, those cars might sound boring to you.  That's how I hear the N55 vs. S55 difference...the N55 sound is very classic while the S55 sounds very F&F.   The issue I have with the S55 sound is that sometimes it sounds good, and sometimes it hits a frequency that sounds like the bumper is about to rattle itself off the car.There's a guy in my neighborhood with a customized Honda Civic.  When he drives by, it sounds like when those tripods came out of the ground and nuked everyone in War of the Worlds.    It's very much a grab your loved ones, say goodbye, and get ready for the end of the planet kind of sound.   But I bet he thinks it's badass.\n\n\n\nI used to watch the following (manual 6 speed) video daily during the 5 months I waited for mine to be built.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmDL4CUw068",

    "content": "Flashed my M2 LCI with a Stage 2 map a couple of weeks ago (Downpipe and FMIC already installed). Increase in performance is extremely noticeable. Power is smooth and the car runs very well. The flashing process was straight forward and much quicker than the Cobb flash I had on my Porsche. Software came with one map token, additional maps are available for a $50.00 payment.In addition, using BM3 I have opened the exhaust valves, removed top speed limit, reset adaptations and deleted cold start. Currently using the aggressive exhaust map but may turn it down once the novelty has worn off (here's how it sounds :).Tried the GTS Transmission today. Gear changes are noticeably smoother and quicker, but the car upshifts through the gears too quickly - cruising to work in Sport plus at 30mph, the car now sits in 6th gear. Works very well for the commute but not sure how it will fare on a spirited drive. Will try it this afternoon and see how what it is like.So far its a mega thumbs up for BM3!\n\nSounds great!  Which downpipe and fmic did you go with?\n\n\n\nYes its a very good map, do you have a dragy or vbox to measure the 100-200 time?\n\n\n\n\n\nHad logs checked last night by PTF and all is good, didn't have any concerns as the car feels solid but worth checking these things. Will probably revert back to stock transmission today and try and get hold of a dragy to log some times\n\nPost the log link I can take a look as well if you don't mind.\n\n\n\nCurious what your ambients were during the run..... Also would love to see a solid 4th from 2k to redline\n\n\n\nI can confirm the aggressiveness of OTS is quietly decreased. V5.1, 5.2, and earlier days of V5.3 are the most aggressive ones. There is a quiet change in V5.3 without updating version number. I still have the stronger V5.3 in my account, so I compared.Excellent log. I'd stay there with stock turbo. This OTS is better than the more aggressive ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really hate that you can't go grab the old files once they are updated. You have to save them for future use.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the power / torque gauges recalibrated to figure?\n\nIs the GTS transmission included with the purchase of BM3?\n\n",

    "content": "So based on the nudging fromSeanWRT, I flashed the latest BM3 Stage 2 91 Octane OTS map to my car this morning, and I've got to say the difference between v5.5 and v5.3 that I was running is pretty huge!According to the changelog from PTF, which is always very short and vague, we have:Version 5.5, August 29 2018:Bucking fixesVersion 5.4, July 18, 2018Revmatch tweaksVersion 5.3, May 17, 2018Burble intensity lowered across all mapsStage 2 91 octane with aggressive burble addedStage 2 E30 with aggressive burble addedVersion 5.2, May 17, 2018Boost target moved from 16.5 to 17psi for Stage 2 E30 mapVersion 5.1, May 7, 2018Fueling Adjustments for E30 mapsVersion 5, March 30 2018:More potent burbles for stage 2 OTS mapsFixes missing burble for some cars, especially 6MTGTS startup roarBurble limited to specific modesApparently, there are more changes under the hood than are reported here, but I can say that from 5.3 to 5.5, the car is significantly smoother, particularly between gear shifts, perhaps to do with the Revmatch tweaks and the 'Bucking' fixes.Having said that, the car doesn't feel as aggressively fast as it did before. If I had to describe it, I'd say that torque builds more progressively now, which could make it feel slightly slower, but I actually found it easier to break traction in 2nd gear on this v5.5 than I did on the v5.3. I also found that I was doing some license loosing speeds where I might not have been previously, so this map is deceptively fast.I'm still running an E20 blend of E85 and CA 91, and have the following bolt ons:CSF FMICFabspeed 200 Cell Sport Cat DPFTP Boost & Charge PipesNGK 97506 Plugs gapped to 0.5mmSeanWRTsuggested that I might be able to run this map with CA 91 straight, which would be AWESOME!Ideally, I'd like to run the Stage 2 93 OTS map with my E20 blend when available, and the Stage 2 91 OTS map with CA 91 most of the time if that's at all possible.I'll try to capture some logs with the 91 and 93 OTS maps both with my E20 blend and straight pump gas (91 only of course) at some point in the next week.\n\nAs great as PTF has always been, people have no idea how much I pushed PTF to improve drivability and change the way boost & load are controlled. There was even an argument weeks ago behind the scenes, it went public a little in the BM3 N55 master thread. They then worked on OTS and updated with V5.4/5.5 which is more refined in my opinion.Halim is the greatest tuner I know with S63/S55/N55 platform, second to none. He has been tuning my car for almost two years, all the way from stock turbo, Dinan turbo and now G Power turbo. At this point tuning is still going on, result is impressive see below - though is detuning it a little bit because rather than showing good dyno numbers, I'm after 365 day and track day consistency, meaning little to no power loss with IAT 120F+. Try that with your map on pump gasThat being said, as I told every one, I'm unbiased and I bash just every vendor LOL\n\nHmmm, autocross this weekend....do I update or not.  Smoother is usually better.\n\n\n\nI joined BM3 right at v5.4 so never had the opportunity to run the more aggressive v5.2/3.  Looking at other peoples logs of 5.2/3 stage 2 93 boost would target 17.2 psi from 5krpm to redline. Load across the whole rpm range is obviously greater on these maps over the latest ots version.On 5.4/5 the boost profile has changed and at least from my logs never exceeds 15 psi mid range tapering to 14.5 psi up top.I have a support ticket going due to my dyno and vbox results being very poor, but the guys have been very helpful so far and Im sure we will get the car performing.\n\nI use 93 octane version.Not sure -I- notice much \"drivability\" change between 5.3-5.4-5.5.  With that said,  I'm very happy with 5.5.  With cooler temps, this thing just rips.  It's very fast.Beware though, -some- overrun pops sound like a short burst of machine gun fireDisclaimer: Only use in comfort mode near military bases and in Chicago.Still (hp robbing) warm here in Tx, but yesterday's quick 2nd gear pull shows 440hp on the infotainment gauge which is the most I've seen...probably equates to 380 rwhp.\n\n\n\n\n\nHalim@HCP+proTUNING Freaksis the DreamTeam since day one with Bootmod3 in my X4 M40i back in December 2016\n\nWe flashed a customer with 6MT yesterday on the latest OTS and is in love!\n\n@SeanWRTwhat about this tune makes it more octane friendly?Nezilmentions this version may be able to be run with just pump gas rather than mixing e85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been running the new 5.5 update for a few days W/ Stg 2 93 tune and confirm a BIG difference in the low speed cruising through the neighborhood to keep the noise down - No more bucking in first/second gears.Also, power \"feels\" to build more linearly  across the rev range with the update.Personally, I'd rather have \"all shes got power\" and let me back out of the throttle if I detect KR or if the ambient weather is above 85F +. Gotta make um fool proof for the masses though.Nitro\n\n\n\n\n\nKR = Knock Retard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm DCT with FBO's including MPE, Fabspeed Sportcat, Wagner EVO Comp 2, FTP pipes, and have been running BM3 stage 2 93 octane v5.3 since release on Sunoco 100 octane race fuel and have logged over 3,000 miles on this map.Today I flashed the BM3 stage 2 100 octane v5.5 racemap to give it a try. Ambient temp was 78 deg F and IAT's stayed between 90-100 deg F after repeated runs in Sport mode. I found the power delivery to be smoother, but even the racemap felt less powerful overall with less bottom end compared to 93 octane v5.3.I then flashed stage 2 93 octane v5.5 while ambient temps dropped to 72 deg F. Honestly, I couldn't feel much difference between this map and the racemap. This surprised me. Is the boost target still 17psi with the racemap and 15.x with 93 octane?Obviously this is all seat-of-the-pants perspective and I didn't record any logs, so I guess the next step is to datalog my runs so I can see what's actually going on.  However, as of right now I still prefer v5.3.I really wish PTF would provide more details of what changes they make between maps so we're not left speculating.",

    "content": "My car makes this ticking noise after it's been sitting for a long time (overnight). I've noticed this since new, but didn't think much of it until I saw this thread:http://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1389358Here's a video of my car. Sorry for the low light, in my garage.Anyone else have this?\n\nMy 17' M2 (Pre-LCI) definitely doesn't make this noise after sitting for awhile. I actually just went out to the garage to verify that it doesn't as well. The car has been parked since early December.Comparing your video to those posted in the F80 thread... they sound pretty much identical and I wouldn't be surprised if its the exact same issue. Post #45 in that thread even says the same part number is used on the N55/S55. It doesn't seem to cause a performance issue per the comments in the thread, but it also shouldn't be making that noise lol. If I were you I'd take the video in to your SA and explain the situation to them!\n\nI believe it's the fuel pump priming up. Mine does the same.\n\nif the car has been asleep for awhile...a lot of things start moving around when awaken\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the same issue. Happened only once. Door open - click click sound. Door closed - silence. Open again - click click.\n\n\n\nI've had this issue happen 3+ times so far on my M2, wondering what could it be? I saw the F80 thread as well, had me worried.Are you guys all stock, any mods/tunes?\n\n\n\n\n\n48 hours untouched? Seems even if I unlock /open a door, the \"counter\" reset. I have an appointment this Thursday, told them to leave it alone for at least 24 hours if they want to replicate it themselves... With my luck, nothing will happen lol.\n\nJust an update, my engine was ticking/clicking again this AM. Parked 5:30 pm last night and nothing until 7:50 AM this AM.\n\nDropped it off this AM. The service guys did say it seems 'loud' but the car does do a lot of \"wake up stuff\".They charged me $30 for a loaner though. Is that normal? I've never had to pay for a loaner at previous dealerships when getting my car serviced.\n\nHow do you guys make the ticking stop? I have to get in the car and press the start button (without turning the motor on). So weird...\n\n\n\nUpdate for those wondering, dealer called asking if I was stock (I am). Sent the issue to Bwm Canada. They said they heard reports of the same thing for the engine.\n\nMy car sits for weeks at a time. I'm gonna go check this out tomorrow to see if I can replicate the noise.\n\nChecked this morning. No clicks or ticks when I opened the door. She's sat for a little over a month now, and I do leave everything unlocked\n\nAnother short update. Dealer still has my car. They have a PUMA case open and will give me another update next week.\n\nWell not a good update.Since I have my car coded (asd off) they will not investigate further until it's brought back to stock. They want $150 to re-program it w/ a clause \"if anything goes wrong with re-programming, I'm liable for fixes.\" They won't touch it with it being coded.I have the car back and it's ticked once or twice on me the past 2 weeks.Doing more research, seems it's not that rare for the ticking. Some got their valvtronic motors replaced and problem went away. One got his replaced and ticking came back. Many says it's normal. Noticed in a volvo forums, some of their cars tick and that's considered normal for them lol. Tempted to live with it as I'd rather hear this every one in a while than ASD every day.But I'm certain my car is now \"flagged\" with coding being done and they might not want to do future warranty work?\n\n",

They say on  their website that there is a backorder they are so popular!!!!Come on fess up! You have one help a brother out.\n\nDid a European delivery of mine in early April.   It arrives at the dealer here in the US on Friday then to Enthusiast Auto for Dinan P2 install and various other bits next week.  Looking forward to 446 hp of fun with full BMW warranty\n\nI assume that the car is run in by now. Please post you impressions of how it feels after the work!\n\nJust noticed your question.   Absolutely love it.  Have about 2,000 miles now with the P2 additions installed.  Power is very noticeably increased as expected.  Similar linearity, just a lot more power from 3,000 rpms and up.  I was a little concerned the exhaust would be too loud but absolutely love it.   Ride around a lot with the windows down and music off.  I coded out ASD.  Only down side on exhaust is living on a quiet street here in Cincinnati with houses pretty close together it is a little loud on start up early in the mornings.  This is just a fantastic car with the Dinan P2.   Sometime in the next year will add the Dinan full suspension mods.\n\nQuite a few of us on the forum have this. I had one of the first ones that were converted from old turbos rather than being manufactured. I had a defective seal that Dinan quickly replaced with no issues so far. It is known that there are fueling issues associated with high HP applications.\n\nNo buyers remorse here which speaks volumes given the price (including BMW labor rates) of the package.\n\nHave had mine now for about 4 or 5 months. I was pretty impressed by the results. About 2 months in I decided to feed my curiosity with BM3 and a custom tune by Cary Jordan. I will say that it \"feels\" more aggressive and livelier when on it. I have a fueling issue here in CA so I add 2.5 gallons of 100 octane with every fill up. If I were back in Canada and had access to Sunoco's Ultra 94 I don't believe I would have the octane issues.I need to get on a dyno to see the true deltas between the tunes.\n\n\n\nI’m about to pick up a ‘17 with the DINAN P2 kit on it, so I’m glad to see I’m not the only one out here with this kit! I’ve been searching around for info on whether you guys are sticking with the DINAN software, or running other more aggressive tunes with the kit (flash or other). I’m coming from an ESS sc’d E46 M3 with a Frank Smith custom tune, but a good friend of mine has been running the JB4 piggyback on his N54 335i for a few years now, and I’ve got say, I’ve been pretty impressed seeing what his car can do with the JB setup, as well as how adjustable the piggyback system can be. Anybody here switch from the Dinantronics software to jb4 to run their P2 kit? In addition to the standard P2 bits, I plan to go catless dp, and swap the meth kit form my e46 over to the M2, so I’m leaning towards JB4, but would love to hear what the more “M2/N55 experienced” might have to say.\n\n\n\nIts not going to give you max power compared to Pure but Dinan offers a very nice power increase worry free\n\n\n\n\n\nAny of you guys do your own diagnostics or coding? I ask because I’ve always done my own on my previous bimmers, but can’t get the software to read any of the ecu’s or modules on the M2. I’m wondering if it’s because of the Dinantronics piggyback? I know with jb4, you have to put it in stock mode to be able to communicate though the obd2 port, so I’m wondering if it’s the same with DINAN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The CSF has a core density greater than the AA FMIC i used to run. Build and quality look excellent and fit and finish is on-point. Originally the unit did not come w/ a way to mount it to the car, but CSF was kind enough to supply washers to all the first-run buyers. I originally put a few washers together just to get it to mount, but ended up going w/ the CSF-supplied solution. I'm really impressed w/ Ravi and the CSF guys' customer service by communicating w/ us here and offering the washers to those who got the first-run of production units. Future orders will have the washers supplied.here is a datalog of a 3rd gear run showing the IAT dropping at speed.\n\ncant wait for the restoftheinfo\n\nYou lucky punk! How did you get it so quick?\n\n\n\nI thought it was advertised as 100% plug and play?It came missing installation hardware?\n\n\n\nso to mount the csf intercooler, i had to get a 1/4 flat washer and a 5/16 flat washer. i would probably go 3/8 instead of 5/16 though because 5/16 is just barely big enough to hold it. 3/8 seems it would have more surface area touching the fmic bracket. the stock screw doesn't have a very large head, hence the two washers.also, i have an ER charge pipe and i had to adjust the center clamps in order to screw in the mounting screws.\n\nTo hang it off charge pipe is absolutely not the way to go.As light as stock IC is, factory use bolts underneath to support and secure it for good reasons, let alone much much heavier aftermarket piece.You even have to use big and strong enough bolt to do the job in my opinion.BTW, never underestimate the negative impact the additional pure front axle weight can have on car's dynamic. Manufacture always tout about how new engine saves 10~20kg, but aftermarket IC (bar plate ones) just adds 15kg onto the very front, the worst place of car.\n\n\n\nQuite odd the mounting bracket was incomplete. Regardless, glad you got it to mount without too much hassle.Hopefully CSF can get the rest shipped out this week - I look forward to receiving mine!\n\nI was part of a group buy for the CSF, but seeing how you had to stack up washers to mount it is poor design imo. Makes me want to return everything and just go with Wagner or ER.\n\nif anyone else part of the group buy, please let me know if my package was incomplete or if you have the same issue\n\n\n\nDamn, looks like Ontrac either lost or delivered mine to the wrong address... Was supposed to be delivered yesterday, required a signature (nobody was home), and now the tracking number shows it as \"delivered\" with \"signature on file.\" No, my signature isn't on file with them, and no it wasn't at my house.\n\n\n\nDisappointing...I also liked the appeal of plug-n-play...Have zero desire to go back and forth figuring out what washers and bolt sizes work...\n\n\n\n@CSF Coolingcan you give some insight as to what's going on with the mounting?  the bracket is too wide for the stock bolt\n\nSorry about the issues you are having OPFin density on the CSF intercooler is impressive\n\n\n\npost updated with mounting hardware requirements\n\n",

Upcoming business travel will preclude me from being able to put much mileage short term.Would everyone say it could be detrimental or cause some catastrophic issues?Your input is highly welcomed!\n\nI think it's always best to get the 1200 mi first service out of the way first, then MOD.If you cant wait - purchase a Dinan sport (I feel the JB4 is too aggressive during break in) piggy back tuner to get a glimpse into the future power that awaits.Nitro\n\nyes you can mod it. no it won't harm the car*. the difference will not be night and day, but you will feel some increase in torque. and you may need to reflash your tune after the break-in.*: unless you mess up the install/flash\n\nWell it shouldn't do anything detrimental to your car at all just don't push hard (~5500rpm or what ever it was in the manual) it till past 2,000km break in period.\n\nThe point of mod is to feel the difference. During the break in you don't even get to use the maximum of stock, modding isn't a good idea.No it won't hurt your engine mechanically as long as you're easy on throttle.\n\n\n\nI'd recommended waiting for break-in....that way once it's done, you actually put the car through its paces.If it isn't enough power...then take it from there.Personally I took off my tune\n\n\n\nYou can mod it during Running In - you just won't be in a position to drive it hard enough to feel the difference.The money may be burning a hole in your pocket, but maybe wait until spring...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide an update- I installed the tune, downpipe and intercooler today.The difference in power is incredible and the MPE really comes to life.As an FYI, I'm probably averaging 20-22L/100kms... this thing is really drinking fuel nowAs with my previous M4, I'll just change maps when looking for fuel economy.For anybody interested, IMO these 3 upgrades provide a lot of value for $1500 CAD/installed...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can turn off that fake interior sound off with the JB4 if it bothers you.And if you're not in the states...eliminate that CEL from the DP.Can also keep the exhaust flaps open full time....although not certain if it'll work with that MPE!Glad you are enjoying the single turbo!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Last week i flashed my m2 and installed a catless dp.I was wondering if for a Stg 1 91 is possible to achieve 470hp without any other mods ?I m very surprised by that amount and was expecting more around 410 and yes i know its an electronic gauge but still found weird.I will take some logsThanks\n\nSport gauge is pretty accurate from stock. But when you piggyback or flash your DME, its accuracy could be compromised.With piggyback, DME doesn't get to see the real signal, so sport gauge is way off.With flash tune, the relations between boost/timing/afr and torque/horsepower can be altered, as one way to bypass factory set restrictions and achieve the preferred torque curve with our load based DME. As a result, the DME calculated power is inaccurate.Personally I keep it stock scale.\n\n",

    "content": "Calling actual M2 owners, preferably manual.How much turbo lag do you feel on the M2 in an everyday driving situation with the occasional necessity to make a quick acceleration?  What about track use?I've read and watched many reviews where I found a mixed bag of answers.  Some have said that it's a full on punch from 1500 RPM all the way to redline while others have said it takes getting to 4500 RPM to get the full punch.So what is the verdict from real M2 owners who have driven the car for a while?\n\nStill breaking mine in, but I haven't noticed any discernible lag.  My N54 135i, with JB4, downpipe, intercooler and charge pipe screams with no lag, but the M2 is stick and is very drive-able.\n\nVery little when just on the throttle. With the manual, it's pretty noticeable between shifts unless you are high in the rev range and quick with your feet.\n\nWhat the guy above me said, except I would say 'unless you drive it like an M car' lol\n\nI feel it a little in Comfort mode. I've owned and driven many miles in 6MT 235i and DCT M4. This sits nicely in between and nearer the M4.M4 in sport has the turbos spooled up full time ready to rock.Not an issue at all in the M2, tiny amount of lag\n\nNot an owner yet, but driven it many times and other modern M cars. The journalists seem to be smoking the good stuff. There is a ton of throttle input lag unless the turbo is spooled.This is physics and there's nothing you can do about it except augment the turbo when it's at low RPMs with electric or something.BMW knows this is an issue and has been researching solutions.http://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho...d.php?t=597327But if you're expecting the motor to \"totally feel NA!\" like some journalists exclaim, you will be disappointed.\n\nOn DCT I do notice it at less than 4k rpm.  I didn't notice it so much when I first got the car, but now that I am more familiar with it and more comfortable pushing it I notice the lag more.  It's more fun at higher RPM anyway!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery noticeable turbo lag if you know what you're looking for.  When you floor it, there's a very obvious ~1 second delay in power until the turbo spools up and kicks you back into your seat. Granted, this can be mitigated somewhat by keeping it higher in the revs and \"anticipating\" the lag by waking up the turbo with a little pre-throttle application.Anyone who says there is no noticeable lag is either naive to the driving characteristics of a boosted engine, or are telling a little white lie.I honestly haven't noticed a significant difference in the lag between driving modes. The throttle response is different between modes, but the turbo lag is much the same.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't ever floor it at a low rpm anyway. Just downshift and it's ready to go. The thing about the M2 is how nicely it revs out to redline and in that respect, it is almost as satisfying as an NA. Most turbocharged cars don't reward revving it to redline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Has anyone tried Bootmod3 stage 1 91 or 93 octane OTS tune?If so does it actual increase boost for a small power increase or does it just make existing power more consistent throughout RPMS?Not going to be specific and ask for numbers, butt dyno results would be fine.  Still trying to master the car at the track and not really wanting to have a jump in power yet so I am considering stage 1.Thanx in advance.\n\nI am pretty confident you get a performance increase.... and burbles\n\nBased on my trackday data logs it increases charge air pressure with aproximately 0.2 bar.\n\n\n\nDefinitely can feel it - S1 93 (98 RON). It's noticeable.  Not crazy.  But obvious enough.The GTS transmission map, custom burble, plus exhaust fully open in sport mode settings has been my favourite - extra power is only on WOT.. but the rest is felt throughout the drive.\n\nIt really transforms the car.  Makes the entire package way more enjoyable.  Plus the ability to customize the burbles (which is genius), FYI I customized my cutoff rpm and cutoff speed (so I have no burbles in my underground park afe at work under 20km/hr and under 1800 rpm it shuts off the burbles.  Makes the car very liveable for daily driving. The power in stage one is noticeable but I would say about the same as when I added a sport cat down pipe.  Then stage 2 was about that much again.\n\nYou will get more power combined with a smooth power delivery.Let me know if you decide to give it a try, we offer the Enet cable with the BM3 license free of charge\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you buy a BM3 license they will provide the cable with it for no extra cost.\n\nHuge difference Stage 1 and stock like a totally different car at least for me\n\n\n\nwasn't there talk early in the m2 tuning development where they said there really isn't any gains as the n55 is pretty much maxed out without FBO, turbo and fueling? whats changed?\n\nyep there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor me, i flashed last week and as is, it took a while to realise the gains from the flash.At first, i didnt felt much change but this weekend, i drove the car more extensively and i found it extremely easy to spin the wheels, even in a corner, DSC off, i gently put some throttle and the car goes sideways when you are not expecting.At some point, i took a long right turn and i barely put my foot on the throttle and the car started to slide.. when i WOT on a straight, it feel like i m on a elastic car. It build up the momentum and then woooosh you are gone.I can't believe this is a STG 1 only on 91. for me, the issue with STG2 is to put the power down.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi guys,Looking for some feedback from anyone who has run some form of supplementary fuelling, ideally still on the oem turbo.The 2 options Ive considered are the XDI HPFP upgrade or the BMS meth kit. The cheaper option would be the meth kit as I already have a jb4 however it has its drawbacks. The XDI pump works like oem with the DME controlling it. The only draw back I can see is the price, being 4x that of the meth kit.Id continue to use bm3 and would obviously need a map specific to what ever route I go.\n\nI really don't like relying on meth for fueling. Maybe a bit of 50/50 to buffer IAT and buffer HPFP.For stock turbo however either is fine. Your limits will be the turbo with 98RON and  just a bit of supplemental fueling.Anything above 16psi past 5K is just spinning the tiny turbo hard, and this is with catless DP's. And you can get by without fueling upgrades at that boost levels if you have strong octane and run the car a teeny bit lean.\n\n\n\nDaleb, just read your message and post here.Believe it or not, with stock turbo and pump gas, fueling upgrade is NOT helping much, if any at all. Unless you always have extremely cool IAT, which just means more octane.Octane is always always by FAR the first and biggest restriction of most platform, especially N55.You experienced \"substantial\" improvement from supplemental fueling with previous N55, only because your previous N55s do NOT make top end power at all unlike M2. You were short shifting all the time staying 4~6k where hpfp is the weakest.With M2 stock turbo, you probably should use 5k~6k5 a bit more. After 5k5, it is all about octane with stock turbo. So will you benefit from more boost (3~5k) that's only possible with more fueling? Yes, you will, but WOT acceleration will benefit at a much narrower power band (4K5~5k). Above 5k, you'll be trading timing for boost. Above 6k, you can don't even get close to stock fueling limit given the octane. Again, unless you always have extremely cool IAT (below 70F).The map you have is as strong as a pump gas map gets. Do not be obsessed with hpfp slightly dip here and there. Doesn't matter at all. And you will NOT want to have more boost any more.Do proper pulls and I think you'll be in low 9s. Don't believe these high 8s result. Ambient Condition differs.If you really want to be faster with M2, upgrade turbo. Or trade in for a competition.\n\nFuel-It Stage 3 and CSF upgrades with Dinan Stage 4https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1537671\n\n\n\nMid 8s is impressive with stock turbo. Octane from E25 definite takes the credit. I don't really see the possibility of breaking into 8s with pump gas alone, at least in my country where I think octane actually lives up to its rating (RON98) unlike ACN of USA.My very best RON98 run (on STG1 turbo last year) was 8.5s on a freezing cold day, using a map that's maxing out fueling and cold day octane. Normally it was just 8.7~9.0s. If it's hotter, low to mid 9s. This is how you're vulnerable and inconsistent with N55 that's lacking the octane.If you're sure octane holds up whatever you throw at it, go XDI pump. Clean and simple. Easier to tune. And actually not that much more expensive than PI solution all in.",

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comThe new M2 has been poked, prodded, and assessed into oblivion over the first couple months of its release. To no ones surprise it has passed all of these tests with glowing reviews and has been labelled the \"rebirth of the ///M brand\". Customers and publications alike glow about how seemingly perfect the car is. They are not alone in that assessment and we here at Dinan find the M2 a marvelous car as well... but its still not perfect.Dinan has set its sights on improving this already iconic vehicle and wishes to unveil to the world the first iteration of the new and improved M2; the Dinan S1 M2. Complete with a dizzying array of modifications to improve performance, sound, and looks the Dinan modified M2 is a spectacle to behold and more importantly, experience.The entries below provide more in depth details on each of the major modifications that have been completed thus far.A completely new and improved M2 experience is just a few clicks away.Dinan F87 M2 Free Flow ExhaustPart Number:D660-0056-BLKApplications:2016+ F87 M2 CoupePhotos:Additional product photos will be posted/available next week.Release Date:Friday, August 26th, 2016.Description:The aggressiveness of a track exhaust and the refinement expected of a daily driver, all wrapped into one is what many desire but find hard to acquire. This 'white whale' of a product just became easier to locate with Dinan's M2 Free Flow exhaust system that utilizes the factory exhaust valve in concert with Dinan's muffler design to allow for this Jekyll and Hyde ability.Dinan's Free Flow exhaust system features 100% stainless steel construction measured to exact specifications to ensure proper fit via factory hangers and mounting points. Dyno tuned for maximum exhaust flow with minimum back pressure, this system is designed to provide a more aggressive sound under acceleration, while reducing drone inside the vehicle. This is accomplished thanks to a computer controlled valve that limits noise during low speed driving and opens fully during high-load conditions to allow free flow. For maximum enjoyment and sound when the valve is opened on the M2 exhaust the system becomes a straight pipe to achieve peak power, flow and tone. No matter if the valve is open or closed the exhaust gasses make their exit via Dinan's signature enlarged, laser engraved, black ceramic quad tips. Not only will your M2 sound breathtaking, it will look the part as well.Benefits of the Dinan Free Flow Exhaust for the BMW F87 M2:Maximum gain of +6 HP and +5 ft-lb of torqueSportier sound100% 304 Stainless Steel ConstructionQuad 3.5\" laser engraved black ceramic tips with Dinan logoComputer controlled valve limits noise during low speed driving; valve opens fully during high-load conditions to allow free flowStock exhaust valve actuators are reusedWhen valve is open, exhaust flows straight through 3.25\" tubingIncludes mounting hardwareDinan Resonator Delete Kit for the BMW F87 M2Part Number:D660-0059Applications:2016+ F87 M2 CoupeRelease Date:Today, August 19th, 2016.Description:For those that wish to have a bit more volume out of the system we offer a kit in addition to the axle back exhaust system that makes removing the factory resonator a breeze. The Dinan Resonator Delete Kit for the for the F87 M2 allows for an aggressive tone to be achieved out of the stock system as well, but coupled with the associated Dinan exhaust the sound is further perfected into an aggressive growl that is hard to ignore. This piece removes the factory resonated section and replaces it with straight-through 3.25\" T304 stainless steel tubing for better flow, and sound.Please Note:The Dinan Resonator Delete Kit for the F87 M2 is only confirmed to fit with the Dinan Free Flow Axle Back and stock exhaust systems. Fitment with other axle back units is not guaranteed.Dinan F87 M2 Carbon Fiber IntakePart Number:D760-0038Applications:2016+ F87 M2 CoupeRelease Date:Today, August 19th, 2016.Description:Efficiency and maximizing the potential of the stock intake design were the keys to development for this N55 intake on the M2. Our sealed system  delivers as much cold outside air as possible to the engine via an optimized carbon fiber tube that mimics the stock pipe but with less resistance with a straighter freer flowing design. The increased amount of air feeds into a larger volume airbox complete with a larger filter that elicits a sporty tone that makes the intake sound as good as it performs. This optimized design yields an incredible 8HP and 6 lb-ft of torque even without any additional modifications. Simply perform the short bolt-on installation in under an hour and enjoy a more powerful and audibly satisfying driving experience.Benefits of the Dinan Carbon Fiber High Flow Air Intake for the F87 M2:More Power: +8 HP & +6 lb-ft of torque without additional modificationsSportier SoundLarger volume air box that completely sealsOptimized carbon fiber intake tubeLarger cylindrical air filterLarger MAFQuick and easy installationPlease Note:The Dinan Carbon Fiber Cold Air Intake for the F87 M2 requires modification of the drivers side strut brace. Dinan is developing carbon fiber replacement strut braces that will not require this modification as an alternative and will be sold separately. Unfortunately this option is months away from a retail release.Dinan F87 M2 DINANTRONICS Stage 1Part Number:D440-0049-ST1Applications:2016+ F87 M2 CoupeRelease Date:Today, August 19th, 2016.Description:The backbone of any tuned setup is the engine tune itself which allows optimization of boost, air, fuel, and lambda targets among other variables. These specific parameters allow the car to safely extract as much power as possible out of the engine. On the M2 this task is especially daunting given how close to the edge of its capability the N55 and its turbo are tuned from the factory. BMW did not leave a lot on the table to work with in terms of additional power output as the turbos are taxed heavily out of the gate. In fact, in its stock configuration, the M2 is nearly the equivalent of a Dinan stage 3 tuned M235i (the stage just short of the big turbo and associated tuning). That is not to say improvements could not be made and the power band improved however.In its stage 1 form, peak number increases were limited but max gains were recorded as high as 31 HP and 31 lb-ft of torque in some cases. Gains average 12-15 HP/lb-ft increases across the power band however. While by the numbers it may not look like much, it feels more fluid and eager on the road. Power simply comes on more noticeably at 3500 RPM and the tuner continues to hold the increases all the way to red-line for a more enjoyable experience.Its a great foundation to build upon while we explore the big turbo possibilities and extract what we expect to be very solid gains out of that next step.\n\nWhere are the suspension bits posted?\n\n\n\nmaybe a dumb question, I dunno.  What kind of gains are available with ecu, exhaust and intake? 45hp/42tq?\n\n\n\nQuick question, but how much psi did you have to push over factory map?Some piggy back out there are even pushing over 5-8 psi over the stock...\n\nWoohooh! How is the drone with the exhaust + resonater delete?\n\n\n\nDinan, thank you for a well thought out package with a little more power, improved throttle response, better handling, and great sound.  I for one appreciate your NO B.S. approach to performance.  So many out there peddle #s that mean very little.Does the exhaust shed any weight over OEM?\n\n\n\ninteresting.will you guys offer a downpipe?Does this exhaust fit with the oem carbon fiber diffusor?thanks\n\n\n\nETA on a intercooler release\n\n\n\nWhen will a larger turbo package be offered?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's say I go stage 1 and then plan to later upgrade to stage ii when it is released. Will I just pay the difference in cost like with the f8x platform?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Might as well go for a multi-sensor piggyback like the JB4.Generally speaking according to what I've read around this and other forums, piggyback's on the M2 have been a hit and miss. If you're just looking for a little bit more power I would recommend a catted DP\n\n\n\neau_rougeBut lightweight never answers these days!It's as if they don't want my money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought this was same box as f30 m4\n\n\n\n\n\nIMHO (just mine) - In my limited experience so far with the M2 torque hasn't been the limiting factor on performance. I've got plenty more work to do on improving rear grip. I'm certain that the rear grip is where I'm losing time. In addition to tires, I think suspension work will likely yield more bang for the buck when reliability is factored in. I don't envision tuning this motor.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comFabspeed Motorsport is proud to announce the launch of our M2 exhaust lineup! Thank you again topup73for graciously allowing us to use his M2 for development. We will be generating more photos and video as soon as possible.Muffler Bypass Exhaust SystemThe M2 has a great voice to match the power it produces, and we wanted to let it sing. Our Muffler Bypass Exhaust system for the M235i has been quite successful as a lightweight and aggressive option, and we have crafted a variant specifically for the M2. This is an exhaust for those who like it mean. Expect an intoxicating and menacing barrage of pops and crackles upon deceleration. In-cabin tone is very reasonable, though, and even with our Sport Cat Downpipe installed it still remains a daily-drivable (and daily-enjoyable) setup. Shed 14 lbs from the rear of the car and let everyone know you mean business.Choose between polished dual wall tips and brushed single-wall stainless steel tips:Installation requires cutting the factory exhaust near a factory break point. Everything required for installation is included. The Fabspeed system installs quickly over the factory piping using the included Torca clamp. Reinstallation of the factory rear muffler is easy.Sport Cat DownpipeTried and tested on the M235i and now available for the M2, our Sport Cat Downpipe incorporates a 200-cell HJS catalyst to add power and a mean sound without triggering a check engine light. This same cat core is used on our Ferrari 458 Italia applications and is more than up to the task of enduring aggressive street driving.Catbypass DownpipeReplace the restrictive factory catalytic converters with a free-flowing straight pipe section for maximum exhaust flow and unleash all the burbles the N55 is known for. Durable T304L stainless steel and properly located O2 sensor bungs ensure longevity and proper performance. A CEL is to be expected.POWER GAINS:Put to the test on our in house Dynojet, our Muffler Bypass Exhaust and Sport Cat combo gains 16whp and 40 ft-lbs of torque power without triggering a check engine light! At 4250 RPM experience an outstanding 22whp and 33 ft-lbs of torque. Due to limited time with our development car, we did not dyno components individually. Truthfully, if you are looking for power the downpipes will make the majority of the power while the Muffler Bypass Exhaust is primarily to alter the sound.CONSTRUCTION:Each exhaust component is precision-machined using our state-of-the art Unison CNC electric mandrel bender, Haas CNC machines, and hand welded by our passionate and experienced fabricators. As always, we invite you to come by our shop and showroom for a full tour where you can see our exhaust systems being fabricated first-hand. We are a full service facility with highly experienced technicians ready to install your Valvetronic system with ease.All mentioned products are currently available. If you have any questions, special requests, or would like to order, please let us know!\n\nThat sounds fantastic. Pops and cracks have been ramped up nicely and the overall tone is much more aggressive (in a good way) good job guys.\n\nLooks and sounds amazing. Just need an option for black exhaust tips\n\nSIGNIFICANTLY more affordable than the MPE...\n\n\n\nIf I had F'speed muffler bypass on an m235i already, could the same Y pipe of the muffler delete be re-used, c/w F'speed quad tips, to transfer onto an M2 ?\n\nWow that sounds fantastic. Thank you guys. I can't say enough positive things about FabSpeed. It has been a pleasure working with them!-c\n\nPrice friend??You ship to Spain??Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\nImpressive package with no CEL and BMC filter for $2,215.00.Well done!\n\nThankspup73&Fabspeed Motorsport!  I live in Central PA and I may have to take a trip to Fabspeed!!!pup73, do you have any other plans for the M2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are running special pricing on the Muffler Bypass Exhaust until next Friday, the 17th. Act now to lock in your discount!\n\nJust ordered the High Flow cat. Curious to hear how it sounds with the stock exhaust before getting the bypass.",

Thanks!!John\n\nSomeone will correct me if I am wrong but the MPE defaults to close and you need the Bluetooth controller to open the valves.Also, the MPE installs but cutting your factory exhaust and thus you will have no issues with your fabspeed as it connects to the factory pipe before the cut. I hope this makes sense.And yes, the cyba tips should fit fine on the MPE.email Brian Keller (bkeller@sunmotorcars.com) at SunMotors and he will let you know if you can order the wiring harness and the Bluetooth controller. And he always has the best prices.\n\n\n\nInteresting. I remember someone on the forum had their bluetooth controller stolen and was able to purchase a new one.\n\n\n\nThe wiring just provides power to the 2 valves and the controller is the switch to control them.You would have to mechanically open the valves and I assume they would stay open as power is needed to close them?I don't think you have any other choice.\n\nprogram to open/close valve to switch from where the M buttons should be on the steering\n\n\n\n",

On dual DME cars flash times are doubled. In addition to that some tools require coding data to be managed and flashed separately from flashing the DME as a secondary step.bootmod3 always uses your factory OEM software version and tunes with it and activation is instant at the time of checkout after which you simply activate with your license key, pick an OTS map, flash and go.Version 0.010.032 of the OBD Agent is now out and the update will be automatically downloaded on your next run of the agent.Have a great weekend!\n\nNice, I'm looking forward to trying this.

Same as above, maybe I am just too cautious.\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons I didn't go with the MPE and went with another after market exhaust that utilizes the stock controller is because I didn't want to deal with the bluetooth controller. With the stock controller, you can also buy an aftermarket controller (I believe it is made by cgprecision) that piggybacks on top of that which will allow you to override the signal (open, close or factory). I also synced my aftermarket controller to my garage opener so I don't need to fiddle with any remotes.\n\nFYI...AWRON gauge also has flap control integrated for certain exhaust systems.

It seems the solution is to weld instead of using the provided clamp, possibly to keep the stock resonator in place, and code out ASD.However even in the threads where this was recommended as a solution, others commented that they still suffer from the cold start rattle and drone, albeit less severe.My question is: with the final version of this exhaust, has anyone eliminated the cold start rattle and drone entirely?If not, I think I may go with the Dinan Exhaust. It seems to not exhibit these issues.\n\nI have the newest version of the exhaust on my car right now. My drone is not as bad as the first version but not significantly better. But the cold start rattle is still there. The rattle was not present before the tips were installed. So I simply wrapped a thin layer of exhaust insulation around the tip then slide the tip over that. My rattle was from the tip and the pipe hitting together.And my two cents in the dinan exhaust, not worth it imo. Doesn't make the car loud enough and still uses the stock valve behavior. I prefer being open 100% or closed 100% but not in between.\n\nDo you happen to have any pictures of how you wrapped the pipe or of how it looks now?\n\nMy MPE cold start rattle is insane but it only last like 30 seconds.

Hot as Hades here in ATL, pulls hard with no noticeable break up above 5K RPM that I was experiencing on other tunes (plugs probably solved this).Should be making close to 400WHP if not more, I'll dyno at Technica Motorsports to verify, feels nasty, not as nasty as my 966WHP M5, but damn strong!Gauges in car show 460FWHP and 430FWTQ.Those that understand logs please chime in.1.5 cans Torco + 93 at fill up.http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b2581e1d10b4304d3cee32d\n\nOverall it looks strong from my perspective but the pull is too short. How much Torco you running? What was the ambient tempDo a longer pull...start your pull at 2k all the way to 6.5k. That will put more load on everything and give a better picture plus IAT's will increase. Always do pulls like that. And if you can do a 3rd, them 4th and then a 5th.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Demon owner he uses Boostane 8oz + 5gals of 93 for 100oct.Obviously you need a little more for Torco. Did anyone reach out to Torco to see what is required for Turbo applications?\n\nInteresting...the race gas map targets maybe .5-1 psi more boost than the stg 2 93 but it allows more timing advance. Your up in the 11-12 range but it was pulling back timing late in the 4th gear pull but no knock was registered.I like your IAT's you had a +18 deg increase on your full pull. I did a similar pull on the stg 2 93 and had a +28deg with just the 5in stepped HD core IC and stock DP. I wonder if it is the catless DP that is helping you with slightly cooler turbo temps, don't think the Wagner Performance EVO2 is doing it all its self. Anyway fuel pump is stable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch control from shoulder on entrance ramp going slightly uphill, cooler now, approximately 84-85 degree evening.http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b272ce7d10b4304d3cee608\n\nLots of MMT validation\n\nYep that is good 'ol MMT\n\n400whp is a understatement. Your car would smoke anything on stock turbo without meth that's ever posted on F87 forum.I had a feeling you're a bit faster than my Dinan turbo on 93AKI.Congrats!\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "whats the difference between the auto stop engine function (at red lights) vs starting the car up with start button?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally not a fan of this feature, just sayin.\n\n\n\nThis feature is quite controversial. I personally like it. My previous car didn't have it, and being a big 5.0 V8, it consumed quite a bit of fuel just at idle. My wife's Honda Pilot had start stop, and it just feels like a sensible thing to do if you're in traffic at all.The wear that you get from starting an engine doesn't really apply to newer engines. Older vehicles with carburettors required the engine to turn enough to create a vacuum to suck fuel through. Single port injection improved this, Multi-port injection improved things again, Direct Injection further still, and now we have Valvetronic so there isn't even a vacuum in the inlet headers most of the time any more!With a cold engine, there is no oil pressure for the first few seconds, and all the oil is in the sump, but this isn't the case when the engine is hot; oil is already at the top of the head, and it's nice and thin so pressure builds rapidly.I have heard that some engines (can't confirm if the N55 does), are able to stop in a position where even the starter doesn't have to do an awful lot. One piston is close to TDC, so starter only needs to turn the crank the smallest amount, the injector squirts and the spark fires and the engine is running.I've heard some owners complain that start stop makes the car feel hesitant because the engine has to start before they can pull away. I think this statement only applies to DCT owners. With 6MT, the engine will only stop if you are in neutral with your foot off the clutch. It starts again as soon as you clutch in, which of course you can do any time before you want to pull away. Even if you're waiting for the lights to change, by the time you've clutched in, shifted to 1st and then applied gas to pull away, the engine is running. I think with a DCT, the quick motion from brake to gas pedal might be enough to cause hesitation and frustrate, but that's not the case with 6MT.My final comment, is that I get 14 mpg on average on my commute if I disable stop / start. With it on, I get 19 mpg, and that does scale to usage of the whole tank.I, for one, will be leaving it on!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.. But I've turned. I think it's a great overall feature and that's speaking about cars in general. Imagine the millions of cars just letting out exhaust fumes when standing still which is basically pollution of the air for nothing.When standing at a stoplight I'm seldomly the first at the light and can't accelerate quickly anyways so it's just as good to turn the engine off and especially if the engine is built to handle it.Whenever I feel the \"need\" to go quickly off the line I just release the brake well in time to be prepared to push the throttle. (I have DCT)\n\nI guess it makes sense if you do a lot of city driving. I do mostly highway (70/30 split) so the start-stop feature probably won't net me much savings. My average MPG over the last 10k miles or so has been 20 MPG. This is including me going WOT at least once per drive.\n\nthe only problem Im having with this is,I only want this to be on when Im in comfort mode,before I think if I switched to sport mode, it would autmatically turn this feature off,but now i notice even in sport, it will activate this featurehow can i get back to the original default state?\n\nI will be turning this feature off now\n\nThis guy is not considering that our cars ARE designed for the system.His point is that you shouldn't buy a car with these features! I've watched a few of his videos, and don't think he's that credible.I talked about how car engines have evolved in my post above. Our batteries are AGM, which are less susceptible to damage from deep cycling that he talked about, and there is a complex battery monitoring system that also will disable start stop if the battery isn't in a sufficiently good state.Is it a complex set of systems? Yes.Is it additional stuff that could go wrong? Yes.Does it safe fuel? A little, yes.Will turning auto start stop off stop those systems going wrong over time anyway? No.Is it safe to use in our cars? In my opinion, Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nits for the birds",

If so, is it with stock exhaust or MPE, or is it due to the ASD?  I will be using it as my daily and I'm on the highway a lot cruising at 70-80 mph.Thanks\n\nI've read about people complaining about drone with the mpe but not with the stock exhaust. I'd stick with the stock exhaust if you're doing mostly highway. Also, I don't think you can order the mpe any longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drone is present when the engine speed is about 3000 rpm for MPE. But who would cruise at that rpm?\n\nIf you're planning on keeping the catalytic converter stock this really shouldn't be an issue regardless of what exhaust you're running. It's mostly people with sport cats/downpipes combined with MPE's who are complaining about the drone.Also there are a ton of ways to get the car to be quieter:You can upshift, close your exhaust valves, switch to comfort mode and code out ASD.\n\nIts really nice on the hwy in comfort mode with stock exhaust.  The suspension is tuned for hwy speeds. It can be stiff and sometimes bouncy at slow speeds.  You will notice tire noise on rougher surfaces but on good pavement its very good.\n\nFrom what I remember there was a slight drone at ~3k rpm, e.g. highway cruising speed in North Texas, but disappeared after coding off ASD within the first few weeks of ownership. Later added Fabspeed SC and still no drone with stock exhaust.\n\nTurn off ASD and all drone is gone, really surprised how loud the ASD was.\n\n\n\nThank you all for the responses!\n\n",

I've waited until the first service is done before dabbling in any engine or drivetrain changes.I've been looking at full ECU remaps and self flash options such as Bootmod3.The self flashing aspects of Bootmode3 is hugely appealing, but there's not many posts on what to expect from the flash on standard DP and IC.Has anyone with an otherwise stock car used the Stage 1 map? If so, is the difference noticeable and worth the money? What should I expect from it?ThanksMP\n\nDrive a few more thousand miles before jump into a flash.You need the cooling upgrade even on M2 stock tune. No one with 235/335/435 boosts up to 15psi and keep the stock intercooler.BM3 STG1 with upgraded intercooler will get you a 30-40whp power bump and a nicer power band than stock which tapers significantly up top especially when IAT goes high.From there, if you want more, do a turbo upgrade or meth or both.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes location, climate and temperature factor in to that at all?\n\n\n\nI used a dinan sport tuner for over 10k miles and loved it (with stock intercooler)...

I've been through a lot of Lucas octane boost and data recording on my M240i and the M2. Such a BIG difference when I mix 91 and 100 for a 92.0 octane blend on the stage 2 91 map.I have found that CA 91 premium gas is really 89-90 at best.Ordering a drum of Torco 108 today - 7-3 ratio will make the M2 happy on the BM3 Stage 2 93 Map... I know.\n\n+3 about octaneI've tried a lot of things in my M235i and the best results were when I mixed real race gas in.\n\nYou guys are crazy. It's very unlikely to be the octane issue (or any issue at all), since OP is running 92oct on 91 map. Things worth asking are ambient temp, humidity. Which seems also normal as power/torque curves shows from his dyno plot.Pay attention to correction factor of SAE, switch to STD, which is what Bimmerpost guys prefer, instantly power/torque figure bumps up by 10 whp.There is another 10+whp or so in 93oct map, which makes around 390 with correct octane and properly performed dyno runs.I'll say op absolutely put down strong numbers already.\n\nIf you didn't dyno your car stock then you have nothing to compare to!Stop thinking every car is the same\n\nGreat numbers OP. You need a stock dyno from their to compare to, you shouldve switched maps while there. We all use STD correction with BMWs on the forum. Yours is SAE which always reads lower than STD from what Ive seen myself on my own car and others.\n\n\n\nI thought this was on 91?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for everyones feedback!

    "content": "Hey guys. I have a question about my manual transmission. It's been years since my last manual transmission; 370z. When I am driving slowly in first gear and I need to come to a stop I push the clutch pedal in and the gear lever into neutral and let the car coast a few meters before braking. Upon doing this every so often I hear a clunking noise from the back under the car. The noises happens only when pressing in the clutch pedal. Perhaps the disengaging of the gear causes some thing to move due to the forces of inertia? The noise also happens sometimes when shifting up to second gear. Any ideas on what this could be?\n\nI think it's normal, it's the engine and drive train moving on their mounts. When the load changes in either direction (under acceleration or under engine breaking), or when just changing to no load (like clutch in), then it can clunk a bit.\n\nYeah, that's what I was thinking too; however, I don't recall hearing this on previously owned manual cars.  Such an expensive cars having groans and clunks?\n\n\n\nI havent heard this yet.\n\nMine does it. It's normal.\n\nWe are talking about manual transmissions, right?!\n\nRight. It's in my signature.\n\nMaybe the Differential...\n\nNormal. Think of it as something that is rewarding. You know this is a result of having a high performance rigid car with an actual diff and an aggressive dual plate clutch.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the manly manual guys are in the thread I'll pop a question. When shifting gears all the gears are smooth except for third which 50 percent of the time feels a little \"crunchy.\" It's only a feeling not something I hear.\n\nI only get the clunk if I let the RPMs get too low (<1k) before fully disengaging the clutch. My theory is that the auto-acceleration feature kicks in at that range, preventing a smooth transition.I've not had it happen when I fully clutch in before the RPMs drop too low.\n\n\n\nWho is telling you guys this is normal? BMW people who want to brush things off? Physics for retards; when two pieces of metal hit each there is a \"clang.\" What is causing these clunking noises when the clutch is released? No way is it OK especially when some people have it and some don't.\n\nIs this supposed to be a manual trans things?I dont notice this,  but i have dct, and sometimes when coming to a stop i do put into netural and coast to stop (like what op is saying i think)\n\nI get this too on my LCI M2... I thought it was just me...\n\nIt happens so rarely and only in that one very specific scenario that it doesn't raise any cause for alarm from me.

Motors and turbos don't die from cold running no matter what you here on TV oil adds.  Now if we were talking about the E92 M3 V8 motor, that's different.\n\n\n\nI've always waited till 200 F (or very close) before I've floored it... maybe that is overkill from what you guys are saying though lol.\n\nThe systems work in unison. Do not focus simply on oil temperature. Transmission/gearbox/diff and brakes should be warm as well. Time limit is dependent on more than just 1 temp factor. Some kilometers are needed for all systems to be optimal.The car contains more fluids and systems other than engine oil. The silly focus on that is useless when so much more is involved as a total factor.\n\n\n\nJust read 140 as soon as ok came on...water was around the same.\n\nKeep it in CONFORT mode to warm it faster; the other modes involve more heat exchange for a more aggressive driving, when ok is in the center than its all yours.\n\n\n\nGlad to see this thread, I was wondering the same thing.  On my '18 LCI the gauge barely ever goes past the 1/4 mark that sits between the first mark at 160 and the center point at 250.  I assume that 1/4 mark indicates roughly 200F.   Yesterday, driving all around Phoenix at 103F, it only wavered past that 1/4 mark a couple of times momentarily but then jumps right back to it.  Even at high ambient temps, in Sports+, winding it out to 6500rpm, my gauge never gets near the center point at 250.\n\nMost oils by 50C (122F) have seen over 90% viscosity reduction.  After that there's very little change so the people that are driving 20 minutes or waiting until 200F are depriving yourselves of driving the car the way it was meant to be driven.  There's a reason the temperature indicator on these cars starts indicating only when it gets up to 70C and that's because once it's in that range you are good to go.  You may not want to track the car until it's a little hotter but you are good to go for spirited street driving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "First off, the DP is a perfect fit. I installed it in my garage, took my time and everything went smoothly. Car sounds good, pulls better, overall happy with the results.Question for those that have installed a DP on your car. In order to unclip the O2 sensors at the engine, you need to remove the engine cover. After I took the engine cover off, there is a large foam piece that is there, I took that off too so I could access the 02 sensor clips. When I put everything back, trying to get that foam piece back is near impossible for me. I ended up leaving it off. Also a piece of that foam ripped. I assume the foam is just for sound deadening? Did you also take that foam off? Were you able to get it back installed?2nd question, the DP I installed is catless so obviously more gas smell. The tips are more black now too. I am running a BM3 stage 1 map. Does the car need some time to adapt to the new DP install? Just seems to be running rich. I know that having gas smell etc just comes with the territory on the install I did. Just wondering if there is a way I can lessen it. Not the end of the world but wanted to ask what you guys think.Thanks!\n\nThat foam actually helps the engine cover stay in place. When I put everything back together it seemed pretty important for a tight fit. Might be worth ordering up another if it ripped.Your DP is catless. There is nothing scrubbing your exhaust anymore. No adaptations will improve this. That said if you have a leak at the DP it will make your life a little worse. Did you buy a new crush washer for the OEM vband at the post-cat connection? If not, you're leaking. This part (18307620349) includes a ONE-TIME USE metal crush gasket. Most DIYs don't even mention this piece. Do not re-use your stock one.All turbos seem to run a little rich. This is probably a protective measure. But even with perfect AFRs it's still going to stink to high hell. Personally I would have gone with a cat.\n\nI pulled back the foam on the side of the sensors but didnt remove.  Pretty sure you want that get another foam piece.\n\nIt is mainly noise suppression and helps cut back from radiating heat coming up from the top of the engine back to the engine compartment wall and windshield. You can prolly live without it....might help the top of the engine stay cool and the fuel rail. I tore mine when I took it out and put back in from the JB4 but i got it back in so I left it.\n\nWas it easy to DIY?I am considering on doing it myself\n\n",

They all do the same thing they same way.\n\n\n\nThe best intercooler in terms of intake temp reduction is our race core. There aren't any options out there that come close to the intake temp reduction.http://www.vr-speed.com/vrsf-race-in...i-n20-n55.htmlThe logs below were taken in 75 degree temps during a 2-4 gear pull. The initial pull starts at 89 degrees and jumps down to 86 degrees by the end of the run.Here's a 4-6 pull from 40-160 MPH. The intercooler starts @ 69 degrees and ends up at 87 degrees at the top of 6th. That's a 18 degree rise over the 3 longest gears running 20psi.If you're looking for a smaller intercooler our HD street core is a great alternative. If you're on a budget we offer a street core that does a great job as well although it's only $130 more to jump over to the better performing HD core.\n\n\n\nAny benefit to mount one of these intercoolers in a OEM car without any mod? Any issue? More turbo lag?\n\nI can't say what is the best, but I just installed the AA stepped IC and it was super easy. 30 min job on a lift. Perfect fitment. Noticeable performance increase above 6000rpms especially in 3rd gear or higher during long pulls. Also have catted DP and JB+ set at 3psi increase. Loving the M2!!\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there really any cheap ones anymore?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the aftermarket IC's weigh are than the OEM one...it is 1/3 plastic.\n\nBeing light isn't exactly a strong suit in a heat exchanger.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Instead of ordering the muffler bypass from Fabspeed, why wouldn't I just custom make one from one of the best bending experts in my area for possible 1/5 of the price?Make it similar to Fabspeeds and same piping and all?Whats pros and cons?\n\nYou'll save like $950 doing it at your local muffler shop. Same thing just not as pretty looking probably. (Under the car anyways)\n\n\n\nHey Guys,Phil From Fabspeed here.  You might be able to put something together at your local shop however they have not tested the system as much as we have tested our exhausts. You might be saying that it is just a muffler bypass how much testing could possible be going into it.  With any of our vehicle exhausts we design multiple different exhaust to create the best sounding and highest performing exhaust possible.  We test all of our exhaust on our dyno as well.You are partially correct in that you are buying a brand.  A brand that is USA built,  all of the research and design has been completed by our staff. Multiple different exhausts were created and tested in order to find the correct one with the best sound. A brand that uses the best T304L stainless steel.  A brand that each and every part is handmade by our staff here in Pennsylvania.  Heck you can probably use a picture off of our site to \"design your muffler bypass\" but if it does not fit correctly you will need to take it back off and modify it again and again until you get it to fit correctly.\n\nFriend has one and it has TERRIBLE drone with a HFC, highly don't recommend buying this - they could of at least put some engineering time into it and added a J-pipe to cancel out the drone.Sounds good revving it in a garage but not nice to actually drive, deadly drone with a HFC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI never said said that we are more American.  I am saying that you can take our designs to the local speed shop and have them make something for you or you can find one online at a less expensive cost.  What I was trying to say is that we do not outsource our designs and fabrication outside of the USA and there are cost associated with doing it this way.\n\nI don't understand why anyone would trust their 60k BMW to a local muffler shop.  Fabspeed parts are high quality, engineered and will actually add value to the car.  Not a chance would I buy a used BMW with a exhaust built/modified by, with all due respect a muffler shop guy.The suggestion that someone copy Fabspeeds design if offensive to me. I see that crap all the time at SEMA, one company, or guy spends the time to engineer a quality part and the next year 4-5 companies from overseas show up with a copy-cat part.\n\nFor me, it boils down to relationship with and the reputations of the vendor/muffler shop.If youve been going to a muffler shop for years, and you know the quality, by all means. With fabspeed (or other recognised vendors) you know youre getting quality, and for me, thats enough of a reason to save the hassle and pay a  proportional premium.That said, i wouldnt go to a muffler shop with a photo of someone elses product and ask them to replicate it. It really depends how strong your moral compass it i suppose..\n\nWell, I decided to buy theFabspeed Motorsportmuffler bypass and downpipe.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust put a remote electric 3\" cutout in the last 12\" section of piping before muffler, total investment less than $350 including professional install.Using a cutout gives you the best of both worlds, you can either bypass the muffler with cutout open (deep growl with turbo whistling) OR with cutout closed, your car still retains stock muffler system.Really blows my mind how much moolah peeps drop on exhaust systems and if you install a system without a muffler, you're stuck with LOUD 24/7\n\n",

New M2 owner here and this will actually be my first BMW!I bought my car from a somewhat local dealer to me (about 4 hours away) and had it delivered yesterday (6/14).I'm so excited to be part of this community and I can't wait to start modding!My goals for this car is to make it a great street / track build.\n\n\n\nWelcome and congrats on the new car\n\nWelcome to the club! Do you have any concrete plans for your build yet?\n\nYeah, do you have any plans? Feel free to reach out to the community for help! We've got alot in store in the coming days.What's your power goals?\n\nI would do a track day first with no mods.  Then you would have a feeling on what you want to improve.  The car is quite capable as a track car in stock condition.  I only thing I might do before a track day is steel brake lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongrats on the car OP (ipeefreely),Where abouts in NorCal are you? I'm currently investigating an octane issue that appears to only be affecting us in the SF Bay Area.If I'm correct, we're getting gas with an effective octane of 88 out of our 91 pumps, regardless of brand. I'm still investigating the situation, and plan to do more by working with others in NorCal to gather logs of engine behaviour.I now have logs with fuel from Shell, Chevron, 76, Valero and Costco on the Stock BMW map and some of the BM3 OTS maps.The current state before I left for vacation, is that adding 2 gallons of E85 to a tank of V Power Nitro+ (results in ~ E20) gives similar performance to 91 octane in SoCal and is acceptable for the 91 octane BM3 OTS maps. I tried adding more E85 by the HPFP couldn't take it and the car misfired at high revs / load; E20 is about as far as we can go on the stock HPFP.I'll be continuing my investigation once I'm back from vacation, and if you're able to help by gathering logs with identical fuel that would help. Once I have some more data, I plan to reach out to Jalopnik and BMW to see if we can start a larger investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI highly recommend Schroth Quick Fit harness, Pro version if you think you'll ever use a HANS.https://www.schrothracing.com/products/quickfit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey man congrats on the M2 pickup!  I'm from NorCal also and excited to see your M2 build!\n\n6/29/18: Laguna Seca track daySo. Much. Fun.I picked up my car back from Trackspec on 6/28 but due to scheduling conflicts, we weren't able to install any of the mods I have since accumulated. No problem, as the decision was made to run the car stock first. We did get to install pagid RS29 pads and do a brake flush though.Got to the track and ran purple group with Speed Ventures. This was a low intermediate group and perfect because it allowed me to get a feel for the car. Please note prior to this, I've only driven the car for about 4 hours total. Had to spend some time having to figure out all the modes this car has (btw trying to have the DSC off and sport mode + on is a bit confusing).My initial impression of the car on the track were not flattering. Coming from a fully track prepped S2k to this car, there was a stark contrast in terms of feel. They were listed as follows:- Car feels like a boat compared to the S2k.- Weight is obvious in every corner and going up the straights.- Higher center of gravity and a lack of a proper suspension system made it feel \"floaty\"- The power delivery is different from the S2k. Much better low end than the s2k but at the time, the car didn't feel right due cause I was still adjusting.- Seats on this car were terrible. By the end of the first session, I had significant bruising on both my knees as I was using them to contain myself in the seat.- The car could use a brake upgrade. Even with better pads, I was experiencing brake fade coming into the corners.\n\n6/29/18 (continued):Despite all the issues (and with all the traffic), I managed a 1.51 in my first session. Not bad considering the car felt \"slow\" and I was having, to be honest, a difficult time adjusting.Coming into the second session, the track organizers grid you based on your lap times. I ended up coming up third behind my friend's Gt3 and a surprisingly very fast Cadillac CTS sedan. I was able to catch both of them but going into lap 2, realized I entered the track with about 30 miles of gas left. Exited the track, gassed up as quickly as I could and re entered but only got about 2 laps in before the session ended. lol. Dropped the lap time to 1.50 though.In my third session of the day, I was gridded once again in third place. I managed to get two clean laps in before we somehow caught up to the last place group and it was traffic city all over again. We spent 2 laps trailing people and waiting for point bys. Not fun. Since this was the last session of the day,  I decided to turn DSC completely off, which made things a bit more exciting. Spent the last three laps sparring with some Civic Type R's. On the cool down lap after the checked flag was waved, my dumbass decided it would be fun to try to do a big drift going at turn 2. Almost ended up head first into the wall. lol. I found out later that there was some oil / gravel there as my friend in the black s2k spun out right behind me at the exact same spot. Nonetheless, dropped my time to a 1.49.Concluded at the end of the day that the M2 has ... potential. Like any other car, it has its shortcomings. I believe that with some proper modifications and more seat time, the platform has the potential to be better / greater than my previous track toy.Stay tuned as we have some mods coming.",

    "content": "Hey everyone. I thought it would be nice to setup a place where people who monitor and log their cars could share information and findings. A couple questions I would like to see answered.What's your stock boost looking like when the car isn't pulling timing? And what is your tune running at?Any custom map 6 guys out there?My experience with my FBO JB4 car is a little concerning and seemingly throws the old N55 limits out the window even on map 1. So what are the new safe limits?Map 1 FBO running with overboost puts us at a 4psi over stock target. Which means our cars on map 1 are running at or above an m235i or equivalent n55 car in map 7. My stock boost will hit 14-15ish PSI which brings us close to 19-20psi in the midrange.Map 2 is the 6psi target. Which seems overkill but my HPFP will hold me off from utilizing it. What I did find with JB4 is if you run mafless the DME and ECU targets drop to around 12psi max right where the stock overboost starts to creep up usually. I will post a mafless map 2 run, I'm thinking this could be the reasonable kill map assuming the octane and HPFP hold up.\n\nLooking forward to your logs, you prob have seen mine in other threads for the X4 M40i.I've worked a little withDKM3PowerM2 Manual and cars are very funny when seeing jb4 logs.In this regards I've joinedproTUNING FreaksBootmod3 with our local tuner Enzo Performance.\n\nWhat's the overboost over stock that you hit at top end on map 1?\n\nVery interested as well just got my jb4 and plan on using bm3 as a BEF\n\nFinally a thread on this side of the fence. Love n54tech but bimmer post needed this thread for the M2's. Thanks for starting itashburyn54. Car arrives next week and I have an aggressive mod plan that should have my car completely \"finished\" by 5k on the odo lol. BM3 is in BETA which should wrap up soon I'd think. They are also working on an IOS version of there app which will be nice. Right now I am strongly leaning towards a complete BM3 flash solution instead of the traditional JB4 with BEF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also have the ability to unlock the DME for Bootmod3, we can flash tune, we can log for you, we can dance.....well at least i can...\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally got jb4 installed and did some pulls. Car didn't fell right and can feel throttle closure throughout the pull. It did get better by the 3rd pull so not quite sure how much this is from \"learning/adjusting\"  to the map. This on 91octane with catless DP and Dinan exhaust. Sent it over to Terry for advice and adjustments.\n\n\n\nHaving trouble loading the files on here. I did all 3 pulls pulls in 3rd gear starting at 2rpm to redline all on map 1 in sports+. This morning I put in 2 gallons of e85 and it's now running much better but still feel some hiccups here and there\n\nCheck your User AdjustmentsBoost Safety if its at 18 (increase to 2)PID Gain: 10Defaulte Watergate POS: 0FF/Waste Adaptation: 0FOL: 60Auto Shift Boost Redux: 10Rest leave blankAnd most importantly UPDATE to firmware EWG9.hex if you haven't alreadyBest way to get logs support is n54tech.comAnd personally have not seen any great results with JB4 on M2..

    "content": "As the thread title says, I replaced my plugs today with NGK 97506, based on the recommendation from Halim and Dzenan. I've heard other forum members say that they found no benefit in doing this, but I thought it worth a try given my lower quality fuel.Interestingly, my stock plugs, which had done 4,530 miles when I took them out, appear to have some yellowing around the base of the insulator that I've seen be suggested as gasses getting pushed out of the combustion chamber. This seems far fetched to me, but the yellowing does appear to be coming from the base of the insulator and it's the same on every plug.The gap on my stock plugs was 0.70mm (0.0275\"). I'm not sure if this is to BMW spec or not, I've not checked, but it is quite a bit larger than the 0.50mm that I set my new plugs to.Installation was pretty straight forward. Removing the foam at the back of the engine is a pain, but possible to do without ripping if you take your time and lift and squeeze it over things sticking up. The biggest issue I had was having the correct 3/8\" extensions for the rear most plug. I have 3\", 6\" and 10\" extensions, and of course the required universal joint. With the universal joint, the 3\" was too low to get a ratchet or torque wrench attached, and with the 6\" extension, it was hitting the under side of the bulkhead. I managed to turn the plug about a 1/4 turn with the 6\", then unscrewed the plug the rest of the way by turning the extension by hand. Torquing the new plug was fine, but once done, I found it a real struggle to unclip the torque wrench from the extensions to get it out! I managed in the end but that was the hardest part; a 5\" extension would have been ideal.\n\nGood tips about the various extensions needed, I am going to be changing mine soon. Were you able to get that foam back in ok? Mine is out and I am dreading trying to get it back in.Also, notice any difference at all? I assume it is just running smooth and done for peace of mind? No issue running these new 0.02 gapped plugs on stock or stage 1 cars?\n\nQuote:Also, notice any difference at all? I assume it is just running smooth and done for peace of mind? No issue running these new 0.02 gapped plugs on stock or stage 1 cars?I'm not sure yet, but I think it does feel better. Unfortunately I went on holiday for nearly a month and came back and had to drive the car for a day with the stock down pipe before I got around to re-installing the FabSpeed Sport Cat. Then I waited a day and installed plugs so there were a lot of changes in a short space of time.I've been struggling with fuel quality here in the Bay Area, and I'd hoped that cooler plugs might help with the octane issues I was having. Having said that, I've also moved to running an E20 mix of fuel now, with the BM3 Stage 2 91 AKI map, and I was getting pretty good results before I changed plugs.I've gathered some datalogs with the new plugs and the same fuel mix and will do a comparison when I get a chance. I'm still struggling a bit with Jet Lag after my holiday though, and I'm therefore not finding the time right at the moment.I don't think there is any issue running these plugs and gap on the stock map, but I'm not sure. Here in California, it's warm most of the year, and pretty hot in summer, so cooler plugs probably help a little when IATs are higher. I'm not sure what happens when your plugs are too cold or the gap is too small. Anyone?\n\nI left the foam out on mine.

Dont care for the tick\n\nQuote:Am I correct you didn't remove the bulkhead and thus the strut cross bracing?Correct, no need. It's pretty tight in there, hence the info I posted about extensions being somewhat critical. If I were to do it again, and I'm sure I will at some point, I'd make sure I had a 4\" or 5\" extension this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a rough idle at 28,000 kms, lived with it to 30,000 kms and ordered up these plugs per protuning freaks recommendations.  Im running bm3 stage 2 with Fabspeed sport cat and csf intercooler on pump 91 octane.  Installation was easy, removed the two plastic pieces from either side, the middle plastic piece and the foam.  Lots of room to hit every hole with long extensions.  I did use a knuckle just above the 14mm 12pt spark plug socket as the coil holes do have a bit of an angle half way up.  Anyways, the new plugs I had to gap to 20 thou, and idle now is perfectly smooth.  Throttle Response feels better too, but that might be in my head, but it really does feel zippier.\n\nI watched this video prior to starting, it helped a lot, however I added the knuckle extension to prevent binding within the coil hole.\n\nAlso with the knuckle you can work around the strut brace, I did not remove it.  I was just in front of the brace for hole number 5.  Hole 6 is wide open, no hinderance at all once the plastic is removed.",

    "content": "Hi guys,New DCT owner, have tried everything from comfort to sport +, sequential or auto, DSC off, DTC or DSC on, and here's the thing :Other than launch control (DSC off; press and hold, sequential mode), the only other way I found to start 'fast' from standstill is in the same mode but without pressing on the brake to activate LC. You just smash the throttle, which will raise rpm until it dumps the clutch and leave rubber behind. It's basically a LC without the limited spin, limited rpm and autoshift from 1 to 2. It's too much for what I want.Other than that, anything else (pretty much any possible combination of manual/auto/sport/DTC) I've tried leads to a pretty long lag before I feel the car actually wants to go forward 'fast', like if there was a delay for the clutch to engage and/or if it wasn't sure if it should go in creep mode or engage. What do you guys do if you just want to start fast from a red light? So far toyotas are faster than I at a start...wtf.Thanks!\n\nThat's all you can do. You cant brake torque it either. Just mash the throttle.   I also just drove a Cayman GTS with the dual clutch and it works the same way.  Either launch control or just floor it. You cant brake torque the Porsche either.\n\nThanks David. Other than for the mode i've described above (all nannies off + sequential), you're saying the delay for the clutch to engage is normal?\n\nMine does not raise the rpm's it just goes.  Your doing something wrong if the rpms rise before it goes.   If it is doing that, you are in LC.\n\nDSC off Auto Mode, just mat the go pedal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYah, I get that but what I really want to do is just brake torque it a little.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYea known in the F80/82 world as \"smokey burn out mode\"So for those that hit the strip......what is the best launch? LC results in constant spinning until hook update in 2nd then spin at the start of 3rd. If you do the burn out mode it is prolly worse. Have not tried that. I wonder if starting in 2nd or maybe just get it going then mash it.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Obviously driving it like normal but some days being a hoonigan & occasional Track day. Oh and with the 6 speed manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.21 Gigawatts!\n\nIf warranty and 'normal' matters to you: BMW considered it appropriate for this car, as overall-package, to tune the engine to 370hp (metric) for putting the power properly down.If straight line speed, wild burnouts and a long-standing commercial relationship with your tire vendor matters more to you: as much added power as you like till the engine goes *kaboom* or the car unintentionally ends up somewhere off-road.\n\n\n\nThe classic n55 is a tried and true proven workhorse. It will be reliable above stock hp levels no question as many, many cars are out there with simple dp's and tunes with no issues. it's not the engine that limits power in this car, it's the turbo. do the turbo and complimenting cooling bolt ons like the intercooler etc. and your DD can easily be 440whp and still get your groceries without breaking down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Shiv used to say, the car will last a lot longer if you have \"mechanical empathy\".It's an N55 which is common in many BMW models. If you want a much better answer, ask in a forum with a 100x larger pool of owners with experience modding the N55. Like for example, the F30 forum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is probably not a lot left on the table if you want 150+k mile reliability. Otherwise BMW would not have had to make so many changes to create S55. If their analysis showed they could meet their reliability targets @ 450hp by boosting a stock N55 higher then they would have done that.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the engine in the M2 is a modified N55 with better crank and pistons.  Dinan has warranted it's modification in the M235 with larger turbo, etc and the same big turbo kit on the M2 engine produces the same power but with the advantages of the M2s basically beefed up design.   People who build their WRS STIs run into piston and ring issues, so if similar modified M235s were having problems I think we would be seeing that by now, and I haven't heard of any.  So I think with the M2 engine tweaked by Dinan with 446 hp you'd be able to drive the car for 100k miles.Is the DCT transmission in the M2 the same as that in the M3/4?  If so then we would not need to worry about that failing.Mike\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "So a few days ago the dude in front brake checked me and I didn't have the time to react, but unlike what I usually do when I have to stop quick (clutch in downshift clutch out in each gear), I just had the clutch in and went from 5th to 2nd without letting the clutch out in between. It happened really quickly, like within a second, and the car rev matched three times, and when I let the clutch out, everything felt fine. I've been doing this ever since. Is it bad to rev match super quick consecutively? If not this is one fast way to downshift...\n\nI am a bit confused. Do you think you have to shift sequentially in a manual transmission? You don't, you can shift from 6th to 2nd if you wanted, for example, as long as aren't going to blow up the engine from mechanical overrev. I'm also confused on what 3 rev matches means, the car should rev match once before you go into 2nd unless you got close to other gates and it falsely blipped the throttle I suppose.\n\nQuestion not super clear but I skip gears all the time when coming down from highway speed to a stop, usually skipping  3rd going into 2nd bc I might not have to come to a complete stop. I also end up skipping 5th while accelerating to highway speeds bc I find the 500 rpm difference between 5th and 6th to be ridiculous.  If you moved the shift lever into each gear gate, it would have rev matched each gear even if you didn't release the clutch pedal. Even if you went from 5th to 2nd and didn't enter any other gates, if you moved close to any of the gates of the other gears it would rev match.  This is all normal and ok unless you money shifted passed redline.\n\nDef skip 5th almost of the time on the way up.  On the way down, depending on rpm will skip 5th or 4th (when in 6th or 5th respectively) on hwy and need to pass someone..I do find that occasionally the rev match doesn't work going from 3rd to 2nd....which is annoying because there doesn't seem to be a specific set of circumstances that I can replicate to make it happen...it's just random.  Anyone else have this issue with the rev match?\n\n\n\n\n\nI skip gears all the time.  Both up and down.  Perfectly safe if done correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno issues here. In comfort I will get more jolts due to relying on the slower rev match... now i've built muscle memory to revmatch in comfort/MDM which is what I drive in 65% of the time.In sport+ because the rev matches happen so quickly I've built muscle memory to let the car do its thing, or use my foot to add to it if I need to. I also revmatch my 1st gear starts instead of letting clutch slip, or slip 2nd above 2-3mph and under 8mph.My biggest gripe is revmatch doesn't allow revs to fall quick enough if you clutch in, move the shifter to gate while on the clutch & brake, so if you let go of the clutch too quick the revmatch isn't proper.Driving in comfort and doing rev matching my own prevents me from being lazy\n\n\n\n",

Initial installation of the MPE will require cutting of the stock system.\n\nI'd suggest finding a local M2 with just a down pipe and stock muffler.  It's pretty insane how much sound a down pipe adds.\n\nIf you're looking for additional sound, want to pass emissions and don't want to cut anything then buy a Fabspeed 200 cell sportcat. It bolts on very easily so when your lease is up you can remove it and resell it with no damage or evidence of any modification. The sound is intoxicating. It also reduces turbo lag and adds horsepower. IMO it's a much better mod than an MPE.More info here:https://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1355352You can also buy some aftermarket exhaust tips (Cyba etc.) for a more aggressive look and remove them when your lease is up.

And since I am still running a cat the heat being generated is off the charts especially on the dyno.Here is an initial comparison to start off, the install and data will need to come later. Fedex was quite rough on the shipping side and tore the shit out of the box loosing the hardware kit for installation so I am getting another form Tiago. Luckily the unit was only slightly scratched up so we are good to goWeight comparison:Stock 7.32 lbsOld non HD core stepped street 17.4 lbsNew HD core stepped street 18.2 lbsHD core Race 30.8 lbsInitial look over the craftsmanship is on point, unit really looks good and it is nicely lightly painted in a silver finish. Side by side...it is a beast.Really looking forward to getting it installed and logging. I so want to see lower IAT's so I can gain the rest of the HP i am missing out on.Here are the pics.....Thanks to Tiago@VRSF for getting one out to me as soon as it arrived......http://www.vr-speed.com/performance/...i-n20-n55.html\n\nNice upgrade. My M2 is still stock and i'm looking to upgrade to the VRSF street intercooler very soon. I'm in south Texas and ambient temp yesterday was sitting at 107 degrees. I was thinking of going for the race but since i'm still stock it might be overkill and may even cause some turbo lag. I will be moving to Miami in a few months so i will definitely need a new intercooler there as well. My job seems to place me only in hot areas haha.\n\nThat is MASSIVE! Does it require the same cutting as the Dinan intercooler?\n\n\n\nCongrats!!Glad you like it",

    "content": "First off, I want to say the Bootmod3 tune is pretty much awesome, especially the data logging function.http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b3e71d6d10b435a85a551c82018 M2 with 91-octane OTS map, Catless DP. Outside temp 82deg.First time playing with a couple of data logs and I had a couple questions.1- I see my IAT going from 113deg to 125deg on the 3rd gear pull. My ignition timing goes from 12 down to 4 then back up to 8. Are those timing values normal or being adversely impacted by high IAT?2- We have 92 octane here in Washington State. Should I run the 91 OTS map or the 93 OTS map and let the computer figure it out?3- If I play with more aggressive OTS tunes, what datalog parameters should I watch closely besides ignition timing and HPFP crashes?Thx!\n\n3. The aggressive OTS map only has more aggressive burbles and nothing to do with the map being more aggressive towards engine tuning.\n\n\n\nTiming always drops in the beginning of the pull as boost comes up but it climbs consistently and you don't have any pull or knock registered. I would not run a map asking for more octane then you have at the pump without additive. Run the 91 mapEven with 93 I have pull now and then due to fuel quality running on the 93 map. As for IAT's if you don't have an upgraded IC your its will shoot out of control when you really work the car. 3rd gear pull barely works the motor.....you need to do a 4th or 5th2k-7k in 4th will give you a better picture....I do 5ths when I can to test the limits  of everything\n\n\n\nTrack day was a ton of fun with the M2!  I grabbed a couple of full-lap data logs at Pacific Raceways.It was a warm day, about 88F in the afternoon. Power felt great, definite improvement from stock with just the DP and Stg1 91 OTS map.I notice that IATs climbed up there, saw some 140-150F so even with just stg-1 I probably need a better FMIC for the track.  Only a few detected knocks.Morning Lap:http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b48ceb1d10b4304ffb14eebAfternoon Lap:http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b491974d10b4304ffb14fac\n\nIn your first post, I noticed that at 15.x PSI at 5500 RPM you have about 7 degrees timing and no differences between cylinders, AFR in the 12s. I'd say that was nice.In your afternoon lap you had a similar situation but cylinder #3 actually had negative timing.How useful do you think \"knock detected\" is here?As well as logging ignition correction per cylinder to stop guessing, your engine seriously needs an intercooler, more octane, a serious look at the datalogs and a custom tune.\n\nYour FMIC is hurting it even at this boost level but Im surprised how awesome the logs still look even with your crazy IATs! Id get some good FMIC and see how it does next time out.\n\nWhat are you using to judge whether the engine/tune is handling the high IATs?\n\n\n\nI would liked to have seen the DME pulling back the boost with these high levels of knock and IAT.\n\n\n\nI thought the afternoon track log looked awful because the IATs and knock were allowed to deteriorate by the DME calibration. If the calibration is designed for this spec (downpipe and stock IC), it could become safe with simple revisions to reduce load with high IATs and knock.\n\nNice / Bad logs or otherwise, I want to commend the OP for actually gathering logs! In my opinion, logging is what sets apart the different tuning solutions out there, and the ability to log and then get feedback is really valuable. The OP obviously has the sense to get logs to check things are OK, though I probably would have done this before hitting the track to be safer.Quote:I'd be surprised if octane was the issue, was running with 92 octane Shell V and the tune was calling for 91.I wouldn't. You're in a different state to me, but I find that I have to mix E85 with my pump 91, achieving an E20 blend, in order to get effective 91 AKI octane performance from my fuel.Halim and Dzenan tell me that my 91 AKI pump gas is performing like 88 AKI on its own without the E85. I'm not saying that it's definite, but it's certainly possible that your summer pump 92 isn't giving you 92 performance.\n\nSend these logs to DzenanLus8aPilotThey will fix her right up.Seems a tiny bit aggressive for a non FMIC car. AsBMWcuriousmentioned.. the tune allowed boost to continue through without reducing taper/load at higher IAT's...The newer OTS's I've seen ( not a whole lot ) resolves this issue by tapering load/boost down at higher IAT's for additional safety margin.The rest of your logs look pretty good for OTS. That vpower 92 works great on the 91 map. M2 needs a FMIC period.but fudge, these logs make me sad... confirmed I have a very slight boostleak now\n\n\n\n",

The guy i go to doesn't care about most bolt on's, and as long as i have the factory tune and oem cat, i should pass the sniffer. But what about the software connection?

    "content": "The difference between SPORT and SPORT+ for DCT shifts is big. In SPORT shifts are nice and crisp.Currently not only are the shifts teeth rattling but also very embarrassing when having passengers. Every thinks there is something wrong with the transmission.In SPORT+ it feels like a first generations SMG. I'm sure there must be a way to maintain fast shifts without the bang-bang.I'm thinking some electronic value could be adjusted. Any ideas\n\nThat's the point of sport+. I wouldn't change a thing.  It the passengers fault for never being in a sports car or in a car with F1 style performance.\n\nF1 cars don't shift with like the DCT. I've been very close to them. All you hear with F1 is rev pitch change.The DCT has a noticeable disengage and re-engage. When re-engaging feels like a teenager learning to drive a manual tranny.\n\nTip: A louder exhaust system would make high rev shifting noises in S+ feel less wrong.\n\nSorry, but it's not a sound thing. It's the very loud thump that you can feel. The thump is so load that it feels like something has broken.Same as with the SMG. It always sounded like a gorilla pounded the side of the car with a 2x4.\n\nI love it and its even more brutal on the M5.  Fricking awesome.\n\n\n\nI think Bmw has artificial kickbacks in sport+ mode. It doesn't have to be that way. You can be quick and smooth - PDK does it very well.\n\nBuy a Camry.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a side note.I've just returned from my second M Tour Day at one of the driving schools nearby. I've asked the most pro instructor about manual vs DCT and he said DCT all the way (also showed me why at the track). But to the point, I've asked about DCT upsetting car's balance during cornering and we tested it extensively on the track together and it turns out that even in Sport+ ECU limits those hard shifts in corners - it was smooth as butter all the time when he changed mid corner but on straight line from standstill it was felt hard. That's actually very clever by BMW and makes me go DCT 100%.\n\nCool, didn't know that!\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEELIUSCouldn't agree more....I like the \"donkey kick\". So back to my original question. It is obviously a code issue. We need to find out how to adjust this.I don't like the idea of having DSC totally off. Never know what happens on any given day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm just finishing break-in and will be hitting the track shortly in the M2 and will experience this for myself.If I'm understanding the \"issue\" and donkey-kick is a good analogy, Porsche PDK-S does this too in sport mode as it approaches the rev limit under WOT. It's particularly severe in the GT3 but and a bit less pronounced in the GT3 RS. Note: PDK-S is different than PDK which doesn't do this nearly as badly. I believe it's done to minimize the shift time even further. Feature not a defect.\n\nUnfortunately you won't be able to turn it off or change it, as it's part of the cars fundamental transmission software. You'd need the development tools BMW have to create a new transmission calibration... it's massively complicated.\n\nJust try a back to back test.Try changing gear in Sport and Sport+ at full throttle, see which one destabilises the car. Take note of how much DSC lamp flash you get in each too.Maybe I'm just a bit cynical but subjectively the shifts in sport+, to me, don't feel any faster, or even fast enough to warrant the donkey-kick they bring... they just upset the car.Just my thoughts",

    "content": "Here is a quick review for people who are interested in aftermarket air intake or Arma Speed Hyper flow air intake. I had it installed for about a month and i would like to share some experience with you.Arma Speed intake is made with double layer carbon fiber and has OEM fitment. It has direct bolt on feature and fit OEM sensor without any error code. The high quality red Kevlar carbon fiber intake, it looks aggressive and matches my engine bay. OEM style design makes fitment perfectly. The closed air box isolates hot air from engine bay and provides maximum cold air into the engine. The air scoop and vented air box design ensures smooth air flow.  Arma Speed is equipped with variable filter feature, which claims more torque at low rpms.For me the first thing I do in mod my car would be improving the sound of it , because it makes you feel the difference immediately and it always make me happy. And when I did test drive right after installation. Right away I heard was the sound of the intake sucking in air and the whoosh sound when I let off throttle. I could feel the better torque when I did a little pulling. I didn't have an exact number on how many horse power it generated but I did sense that it improved a bit on the turbo lag problem since I have catless down pipe.I switched to Arma Speed intake system from Injen technology.  But since they are at different price point, you can't really compare with one another. I just want to share the experience regarding differences that I felt. To be honest, Injen intake has open filter design so it makes the sound a bit louder than Arma speed. On the other hand, the high quality carbon fiber and OEM design makes Arma Speed intake looks nicer and cleaner in engine bay. Over all I would definitely recommend Arma Speed. It does not only look impressive but it also enhances performs and will take your car to the next level.Thank you Eddie and Bobby@ArmaSpeedUSA, @ImpressiveAutoConcepts and Alan@ModAuto\n\nWhere did you get these lights from!??\n\nDid the injen intake throw any codes?\n\nBeautiful intake finish\n\nIs that the IND front lip spoiler?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwow~~Kevlar intake~~~\n\ni love impressive wrap!!!!!\n\nThis looks so good!!

Only thoughts could be the heat. It's been around 80-90 F past couple weeks.\n\nEverything I've been told is that if you are going Stage 2 you should be upgrading the IC. I did so and have had no problems thus far - in 90-100deg summer heat at altitude.  For the $500 or so seems like a worthwhile upgrade.\n\n\n\nIf your not logging with the tune then your just grasping at thin air. Every car reacts differently in different environments etc..... nobody can tell you what is going on if you can't see what it is doing.\n\nSo mine finally threw a code today P0301 Cly 1 misfire.  Gonna make an appt at BMW for annual oil change/service so I will just let them deal with it.\n\n\n\nExample today.......ran the mountains hard then had to fuek up before heading home. Filled up with Exxon 93 then did some pulls on the highway. Tons of knock registered and major timing pullIt just did not feel right and still seemed to boost into the high 16's but had a lot of huge timing drops.....nothing but crap.You would never know this if you weren't logging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I took my car into BMW today because the hesitation got worse, basically undriveable.  The CEL came back on and a DRIVE TRAIN MALFUNCTION warning came on as well.  I just got a call from my SA, they scanned the car and it is showing a misfire in all 6 cylinders.  Thankfully I have not done anything to the DME, so whatever the issue is will be covered under warranty.  Should I just tell them to swap in a M2C motor and call it quits\n\n\n\nWould changing the spark plugs help?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I just got a call from my SA, he said that they cleared all the codes that showed a misfire in all the cylinders and road tested the car (with my permission)  the CEL did come back on but only showed what I had initially diagnosed, a misfire in cyl 1.  So they ended up replacing the cly 1 injector, plug and coil and he said that fixed the issue.  I asked why it showed a misfire in the other 5 cylinders and he said that it was most likely a brief misfire that the DME corrected for when the number 1 cyl injector went.  So I will pick it up later and see what happens.  I'll let you know.\n\n",

    "content": "I am really beginning to think fuel is my enemy. I seen to always get fuel...even at Shell that cannot keep consistent timing at 93 oct. I went to the mtns Sunday and had to fill up right when I got back to the highway .... looked around and found a large Exxon station. No Shell nearbyI did some highway pulls afterwards since my IAT's were down around 103, ambient was I think 79 give or take. The logs were crap..... major timing pull, knock recorded, time sometimes went from 9.5 to 4 on some cylinders. It got boost up to the mid 16's and the load was between 94-99 but timing was all overthe placeMight be time to use the additive again or map down to Stg 1 93 or stg 2 91http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b425d8cd10b43793494a2fahttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b426002d10b43793494a2fdhttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b42606bd10b43793494a2fehttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b426110d10b43793494a2ff\n\nIt's not necessarily really the bad gas. Especially if you're doing great on cool days.If you open timing table from stock map, you'd be surprised how little timing retards there is to IAT increase. In reality, cylinder ignition time (and thus ignition timing) is much more sensitive to IAT.BMW does that to have cars make consistent power under all circumstances. And the premise of that is to not approach timing limit with cool IAT. Therefore, on hot days when DME demands higher boost to offset thinner hot intake air, timing loss would be minimal. So you have the power consistency.Most of the aftermarket companies tune cars to low or normal temperature. They wouldn't sell tune coming back from 100F track day and telling you sorry there is only so much more power we can reliably make over stock. No one appreciates that.From my observation, they would make sure your car is holding up great at below 80F with correct octane and doing just fine at 100~110F. Above that, relax a little bit. That's normal and is what happens when you have a map that approaches octane limit to make power on cool days (who doesn't like that) and doesn't retard enough timing to high IAT. BTW, the day before I saw 410whp+ with Dinan turbo on pump gas last year, Dzenan specifically asked me to keep IAT below 80F. So I did.The dramatic change of timing table would be too many risks and not rewarding at all (sales and customer feedback). People thank tuner only for making big dyno number and driving smoothly on street, not for backing off on power. In addition, absolutely no one with sanity tracks his or her car with the aftermarket tune that makes maximum power on the dyno sheet.My point is if you want to stay on STG2 93OCT, you either keep IAT under 110F (Pure Inlet will help) or be easy on hot days. Or log STG2 91OCT and report back.Be easy for a moment, think what happens with piggybacks on hot days LOL\n\nMaybe in the summer, increase octane a little bit via octane booster or better gas?\n\nI might try lower oct map till the new IC gets here, I really didn't want to resort back to the orange glow. Am I correct to assume that difference between stg 1 & 2 is mostly boost and between 91 & 93 is timing? If I can get out this morning it should be cooler I will pull a few more on the current STG 2 93 for shits n giggles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell we were to have a cooler morning for a change so decided to go do some pulls on the same gas. Ambient was 72. All IAT's started a good bit below 100 and the max i see at the end of a 3 gear long pull is 122......I was thinking of trying the stg 2 91 to combat the timing pull but going to play with the E30 and log againhttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b447e1cd10b437911b1c9f8http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b447e37d10b437911b1c9fahttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b447e69d10b437911b1c9fbhttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b447ea2d10b437911b1c9fd",

You guys have any experience with them?108A01 - charge-air temp sensor, electrical: short circuit to B+119001 - Rail pressure sensor, electrical : short circuit to B+120408 - charging pressure control : switch off as consequence (maybe fracked charge pipe?)121001 - Charging pressure sensor, electrical: short circuit to b+138104 - exhaust flap activation (fabspeed bypass)1C3101- Engine-oil pressure sensor, plausibility: pressure too high before engine startI had jb4 for bout 8k miles.Any help would be greatly appreciated. I know the Berger intake has a CEL (so maybe first code is for the intake?)Drove the car to the gas station and it is in limp mode.Double checked to make sure I plugged all the plugs in and they are.\n\n\n\nI cleared them, and they came right back\n\nThat is really odd, i just removed my JB4 and no codes.\n\nI got some help from a few people diagnosing... and basically I gotta replace the three sensors that the jb4 plugs into. And we think that will fix the problem.I did NOT disconnect the battery while unplugging jb4 so maybe that is what could have killed my sensors? Not sure.I will keep you guys updated once I get the new sensors in place! Hopefully by the end of the week\n\nNo way you fried those sensors unplugging them.  Are you clearing the codes with the ignition on and engine off?\n\n\n\nWhat scanner are you using?  Might be worth trying a more expensive one.\n\nWhat are you using to read codes? Try clearing them while car is running\n\nBurnt fuse maybe?\n\nWas there any update on this? This kind of crap is exactly why I haven't pulled the trigger on a JB4.\n\n\n\nWell update. Car was hit. Been in the shop being fixed, and now it's at the dealer. I got a hold of them, and it's a blown dme. They have not given me a price on a new one yet. But I will keep you guys updated.And new flash is bought and ready to go in, as soon as I get it back!\n\n\n\nWell.......I tried the JB4 route first and it was so aggressive and surgy. I tried multiple maps and both E25-E30 and 93 and with with booster at times. The car flat ripped up the road and always tried to push the boost but it ran so erratically I could not stand it....then if things were a little off it would error out. I really think with the higher boost if tried to push and how hard it came in it would have made more dyno power than my current BM3 flash but I really really hated the way the car felt. So I gave up on it and went to the dedicated flash. I never gave it with a BEF a chance.So just to be clear I am not a JB4 hater, ran it on my M4, M235 & 135 and it rocked. I just thought it sucked on the M2. The BM3 tune is sooooooo smooth and dependableAs for the DME damage......I really find it very far stretched that a modern day unit would do that but it is electronics. Even when those hit the + battery terminal with the plug it only damaged part on the JB4 circuit and not the DME. Wonder if there was water intrusion.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I heard back from Bmw today... and the total is 3700 for a new dme... so they ordered one.. and I can not wait to have the car back!",

    "content": "Hi FolksI see many threads about bad gas quality and generally the available gas quality seems to widely spread.So what octane levels is your fuel available where you live?In switzerland the worst quality is 95 octane. Then we have 98 octane and the good stuff is 100 octane (shell v-power).\n\nHere in  the States, premium is usually defined at 93 octane with 91 being considered as 'mid grade'. You should probably add those  to your list.\n\n\n\nThe US and Canada use AKI (Anti-Knock Index), which is (RON + MON) / 2.  Elsewhere, RON (Research Octane Number) is the most widely used.  RON is usually 8-12 higher than MON (Motor Octane Number), so there is usually a difference of 4-6 from RON to AKI.  95 RON in most of the world would normally equate to 91 AKI in the US & Canada.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating\n\nYeah. Does numbers need to specify Ron or AKIGuessing its RON based on numbers\n\nYes it‘s yet RON based. But options could be modded to show both (and combine those which are equal).Mods please help!\n\nIt's actually a bit more complex than that. There is no straight conversion from AKI to RON because the MON value needs to be considered as well.It is basically true that 91 AKI is roughly equal to 95 RON and 93 AKI is roughly equal to 98 RON, but that's not always the case.I'm no expert, but my understanding is that MON is actually the more important value for our forced induction engines, and it's totally possible for a fuel to have a really high RON and a really low MON and still equal 91 AKI. This would be a poor quality fuel but would still be 91 AKI. In the rest of the world this poor fuel could be marketed as 97 RON, but it wouldn't be as good as another 97 RON that had a higher, but un-reported MON.There is also ethanol content to consider. In California, all fuel can be up to 10% Ethanol, without being reported to the customer. This results in all fuel being E10 here. Ethanol has a high AKI rating, so California's 91 AKI is likely around 88 AKI base gasoline, with the Ethanol raising the AKI to 91. In my car, this seems to perform as 88 AKI according to Halim's analysis of my BM3 logs.Usually if Ethanol is mixed in to your regular pump gas, E85 will be available in your region. Sadly, this fuel can actually range from E70 to E85, usually depending on the season and region (colder seasons in colder regions lower the Ethanol content to help with cold starts). In California, winters aren't cold, so I've heard that our E85 is usually pretty consistent.Finally, in the US it's usually possible to get various types of Race Gas. It's certainly not as widely available as regular pump gas, but for me at least, there are three Race Gas suppliers in a 20 mile radius, where they sell 100/101 AKI from the pump, and other octane fuels in 5 gallon pails. There is usually both RON and MON data for these fuels.Doing a poll is a nice idea, but it would need to be a really long list.\n\nIn the U.S. unleaded gasoline typically has octane ratings of 87 (regular), 8890 (midgrade), and 9194 (premium).\n\nI see the topic is more complex than i thought. If i‘d get the rights to edit the poll i‘ll go through it and aort it out. Otherwise postings likem2ruderare very welcome to get an overview\n\nI have 4 E85 fuel stations in my area. Basically 108 octane?",

I am guessing it should be very similar to the way a dinan res delete sounds right?Thanks.\n\nI am sure that any reputable exhaust shop can make you a piece.  It is just a mater of if the cost is going to be that much different.  I went with the Dinan part and did the install myself in about 30 minutes.\n\n\n\nI just did mine with Dinan, and because I didn't have the right tools or lift really, I couldn't get it off my self.

Simple thing to do no tricky bends or anything. I have a downpipe on the car and noticed more turbo noise thru the exhaust, and slightly enhanced crackles\n\nI concur with dtmpower98.

I live in quite an enclosed area and the cold start noise of my stock M2 probably annoys the neighbours as it is. I fully expect (and want) the MPE to be louder, but not on a cold start. Would I be right in saying, on a cold start with the exhaust in 'default' mode, it would still channel through the muffler and as such the noise difference would be negligible compared to stock? I'm aware the muffler is a slightly different design and the valves are open on cold, just hoping the noise isn't too much louder...In a nutshell, I'm looking for someone who's gone from stock to MPE to comment on the difference in cold start volume.Thanks!\n\nIt's much louder even with valves closed.

This exhaust will wake up the stock M2 personality with a better sound and improved flow. If you feel the stock exhaust is just too quiet, then this is a great option without going overboard.On top of the enhanced sound, this exhaust system comes with a Bluetooth controlled flap system, which allows you to adjust the sound level to your needs.Features:- 100% Titanium- Quad Titanium Exhaust Tips- Bluetooth Controlled Flap SystemBMW M2 (F87) Muffler Bypass Exhaust SystemProduct Details:Up the aggression and drop weight while unleashing the visceral tones of the BMW F87 M2 with Fabspeed's wildly popular Muffler Bypass Exhaust; now available with multiple tip options!There are loud exhausts and there are great sounding exhausts. When you have a loud AND great sounding system... it's pure perfection! The M2 has a great voice to match the power it produces, and we wanted to let it sing. Our Muffler Bypass Exhaust System deletes the rear muffler, shedding 14 lbs in the process. This is an exhaust for those who like it aggressive. Expect an intoxicating and menacing barrage of pops and crackles upon deceleration. In-cabin tone is very reasonable, though, and even with our Sport Cat Downpipe installed it still remains a daily-drivable (and daily-enjoyable) setup.FEATURES:Fits all BMW F87 M2 vehiclesSaves 14 lbs from the rear of the vehicleWill make everyone you know envious of the glorious sound errupting from your BMWConstructed from 14-16ga T304L 3\"-2.5\" stainless steel tubing in house at Fabspeed MotorsportChoose between Brushed Single Wall Stainless Steel, Polished Chrome, and Black Chrome tipsAll Fabspeed performance products are backed by the Fabspeed Lifetime Limited WarrantyNOTE:  Installation requires cutting the factory exhaust near a factory break point.

Both have been recently installed over the past 1.5 months. The combination sounds awesome and the videos online don't do it justice.  Very deep down lows and it roars up top.  Add to it the extended overrun of my HEX tune in Sport +, and throttle release sounds like the battle of Fullujah!!I am in the process of dealing with some fitment issues though unfortunately.  The installed tips hang at too much of a downward angle.  Fabspeed thinks it actually might be caused from the downpipe and not the exhaust itself.  From what I understand they updated the jig for the exhaust a while back for better fitment.  Hopefully they will contact my shop directly and talk to the mechanic who installed both to try and get this solved.  I am giving them the benefit of the doubt in the mean time that they will find the most painless solution to the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know if the Fabspeed muffler delete can be used in conjunction with the Dinan resonator delete pipe?",

    "content": "I just used theTechnicPNP harnessto bypass active sound design (ASD) in my M2.  Install went exactly as described in the thread.The difference is remarkable.  I wish I had been more scientific and taken before and after SPL measurements; I think it's gotta be 6 dB at 70 MPH.For those of you concerned about the cabin noise or irritated by the artificial sound you should do this mod.  This is the absolute best modification I've made to a car ever.  Thank youTechnic!This car sounds great and the ASD detracts from that.  Of course there's more noticeable road noise with the ASD bypassed, but that's obviously a separate matter.  I suspect BMW cranked up the ASD to cover for the missing sound deadening.  But the effect is overwhelming IMHO and I'm absolutely glad it's gone!\n\nThanks for posting, I am going to definitely do this mod.  From the videos I have seen it appears pretty intrusive when you go into sport or sport plus modes.  It will be nice to just have the natural sounds in the cabin.\n\nBuddy, can you please do some recording for us as we would be interested to hear the difference.\n\nPlease make a comparison video between with and without ASD. That would be greatly appreciated.Another point is the question if you really need this option. What if we just code it out or pull the grey ASD plug from the HK amplifier? Either option is a lot cheaper than paying for this cable and it does the same thing.MR\n\n\n\nSorry, I love you guys, but I'm not gonna tear my trunk apart again for comparative analysis. I wish I had borrowed a friend's SPL meter and done a before and after for a more scientific review but that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm just glad the ridiculous booming is gone and I can hear my own thoughts while driving this great car!\n\nCan someone confirm that this does not also disable the electronic flap for the exhaust. Obviously that would be a very undesirable side effect. BTW I ordered one today\n\nNot sure why it would affect the exaust, but I can confirm it does not. Same, sick cold start sounds!\n\nOnly reason I asked is that the comfort and sport setting which affects the ASD also affects the exhaust flap. I didn't know if they were tied together in some way. Anyhow, good to hear that they are indeed separate. My bypass harness is on order.\n\nGot it. The link in my original post has a detailed 2er installation walk-through. Another member struggled with the connector keying, I think maybe they forgot to swap the housings. The guide covers all this. I used a spare hole in the main amp's mounts as a mount-point for the original cables tie-down then cable tied the new harness to the mount-point I removed the original cable from on the ASD module. It was easy to do a clean install.There's almost zero sound deadening in the trunk...made me wish I had a roll of dynamat on hand. There was a big slather of glue on the driver's wheel well in my car; someone must have been preparing to do an M235i sound dampening install when they realized it was an M2.\n\nInstalled mine tonight. One less item on my to-do list.\n\n\n\nThe real deal is much better than the artificial stuff.\n\nWould it be reasonable to remove a fuse to hear the car without asd prior to coding it out or bypass?  Apparently fuse 122 disables the radio and asd.\n\n\n\nDo you think there is any difference in comfort mode without ASD?\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks.   I plan to disable Asd ASAP.\n\nGuys, I want to film it someone when I have time, but I do not know how to do it. If I come up with an option to find a decent comparison I will make one. First need to order that cable and install it.MR\n\n\n\nDoes the ASD amplify the engine noise even at idle? Have noticed the engine is noisy in the cabin, in a bad rattly type of way.",

    "content": "So just for the hell of it took the 2ruder to Z-Max raceway Friday evening and got some runs in. Since it was test n tune it was wide open so I ran 19 times. That is 19 launch control timesSince it was my first time I screwed up a few royally so I am posting all but 4 of them. Z-Max is a 4 lane strip. They run 2 lanes for street tires & 2 lanes race radials/slicks.12 of my runs are on the street side, the last 3 runs of the night they let me hit the race side. I will say on the strip, mainly the street tire side that has less sticky prep there is so much wheel spin with street tires....the car seems to spin n float thru first, spin thru most of 2nd then hook up then shift to third and spin some more and finally hook up. I also did LC every time and it slams into gear and runs all the way up to 7500 rpm which we all know the car falls on its face over 6k so was probably loosing time there. My average of 12 runs on the street side was 12.8225 @111.851. The average of 3 runs on the slick side was 12.623 @113.093. The slick side had way less wheel spin but I got a shit tone of wheel hop.....it was quite scary. But the first run on the slick side was a 12.434 @114.200, but for some reason the other two just wheel hopped but were not as fast.Below is each run, a few logs that I was able to catch in-between the app acting up. on the logs the beginning of the logs will be the roll up, staging and a short time at 3k+ rpm for LC even though it shows 100% pedal you have to look forward to the revs going up at clutch dump. I had higher expectations from the car and tune due to the fact they claim a 4.2 0-60 and 12.7 1/4 times from a stock car and me being tuned and exhaust but the car spun so much I have not idea how they achieve those times.pick away18 LC!BM3 stg 2 93VRSF stepped street HD core FMICMPEstock Conti'sLaunch Control used every runRuns:street lane12.856\t111.26\t\t95 amb12.778\t110.8512.866\t111.8612.874\t112.6212.864\t110.6512.981\t112.1912.888\t112.92\t\t91 amb12.72\t112.05\t\t88 amb12.687\t111.6812.775\t112.4112.783\t111.7412.798\t111.9912.822\t111.85slick lane12.434\t114.20\t\t88 amb12.682\t111.6412.754\t113.4412.623\t113.09Some logs:http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b36caa3d10b43733479298fhttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b36dacfd10b4373347929c7http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b36e687d10b4373347929e4http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b36e9b8d10b4373347929fchttp://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b36ed4cd10b437334792a00http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b36ef81d10b437334792a09\n\nWhat tire psi were you running at in the rear? Probably should be in the low 20s for drag strip. Also make sure the traction control is turned all the way off.FYI i wouldn't recommend doing that many launches on street tires. All that wheel hop will eventually break something.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes you can reset at a lower pressure. That's what I did first every time of HPDE.What other cars' results? Ambient is hot so try get some context.\n\nThanks for posting. Pretty disappointing. I'm stage 2 as well. Was hoping for way higher trap speed\n\nI didn't pay much attention to others times...I mainly lined up to american muscle, chargers, challengers, mustangs, etc but everybody was running hot\n\nYeah those trap speeds are barely any higher than standard. Both bm3 and mhd dont seem to produce the goods on the strip unfortunately\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDont feel bad about the times, I've done a few 0-60 pulls with dragy and I couldnt get past 4.6 sec. Far from the 4.2 that BMW claims.\n\n\n\nDaleb:Dyno results were pretty much the same. If you want to look at the logs you can. With 88deg ambient I bested a 378/430 on the stg 2 93 with booster to support octane & with the older core FMIC. Now I am running a HD core but ambients are higher and I was running it in open air. Either way not the most impressive considering my car made 349/395 stock in 69 deg temps.SeanWRT:As always your a opinions and expertise are a great help....and I listen & learn from all of them. I know the smaller IC's is not cutting it in these temps as we have discussed in the past, I am waiting on the latest VRSF race HD core unit to install and log. My post was not a complaint just evidence of results based on the situation & conditions. The variables are less than perfect and numbers are low but even then the car runs smooth, I feel it is safe & dependable. I did 19 runs in 4 hrs in that heat and never did it miss a beat. Might not be making 400 hp but it pulled strong and all those launch controls did not blow anything upI better not keep doing it though. On a different note what do I look for on load? actual load...not target correct?425M2:Thanks for the support.... yea my draggy numbers are kinda off from what is advertised for 0-60. The best I ever got on the street using LC was 4.25 but mostly 4.5-4.8\n\nDaleb,Here are my dyno run logs from 5/05/18http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5aee0504d10b430d0ca61940http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5aee06b4d10b430d0ca61942\n\n\n\nMy guess is the ambient temp was high and we all know these N55's cut power pretty hard above 5000rpms when they're heat soaked.  If the car was spinning as much as you say in 1st and 2nd, then you're gaining ET and loosing MPH.In sub 60 degree temps and a stickier track, I imagine the car could go 12.1-12.2@116-117mph.  Not too shaddy, IMO.How did the M235 do?\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo things I think was killing me other then the temps#1 35psi street tires. next time i will drop 5-10 psi and reset the TMPS and see if it will let me run. I thought it is pressure specific but what I have read it should let me lower and reset as good?#2 I ran launch control each time and it shifted at 7500 which I think I might have not been making any time over 6k. I looked at my dyno sheet and it pulls up to 5700 then hits a dip then back up till 6100 then falls off so the last 1500 rpm might be loosing me time\n\nDalebI didn't read all of OP's log. Just the first one shows IAT starts from 120+ and ends at 150+ on 4th. Keep in mind in a standing still drag race, IAT starting temp is deceiving because car's been idle for a while and is hotter than normal. You see his IAT drops to low 120 on 2nd gear, which means in real world when car in motion, normal IAT in sport/sport+ would be 110~120 at max. You imagine what would happen if OP does back to back runs after 150+F.http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5b36caa3d10b43733479298fm2ruderIn fact off the line you're doing pretty good. The problem is really horsepower especially from 3rd gear.According to your dyno run, best shifting strategy is:1-2: redline 7k->4k (in theory it should be 3k5, but in real world it's 4k when DCT clutches to 2nd)2-3: redline 7k->4k53-4: 6k5->5k4-5: 6k5->5kKeep in mind, leave it to redline on 1-2 and 2-3 even power band tells you other wise, because there're traction coming into play and DME most of time makes the best decision.",

    "content": "So question for the guru's,Anybody know the ramifications of using launch control excessively or have heard of any ill effects? I have scoured the internet and only found speculation & looked up the info in the manual and it does not state much. Now I know is harder on components but so is dumping the clutch on a manual, burn outs, drifting, etc.I ran at Z-Max last Friday and did aprox 22 launch control passes in 88-94 deg weather and not once did i get an error of trans overheating or anything out of the ordinary..... It just motored on as usual. Just curious what the more experienced owners know or have experienced.Here is what is in the manual\"Launch Control\"The conceptLaunch Control enables optimum acceleration on surfaces with good traction.General informationThe use of Launch Control causes premature component wear since this function representsa very heavy load for the vehicle. Do not use Launch Control during the break-in,refer to page 152, period.RequirementsLaunch Control is available when the engine is warmed up, that is, after uninterrupted drivingof at least 6 miles/10 km. To start with Launch Control do not steer the steering wheel.Activate Launch Control1.Deactivate Dynamic Stability Control, refer to page 114.2. Select Sequential mode with gear 1.3. With the engine running, apply the brake with the left foot.4. Fully depress the accelerator pedal. The starting engine speed adjusts.5. If necessary, change the starting engine speed by 500 rpm via cruise control.6. Release the brake, the vehicle accelerates.Continue to depress the accelerator pedal. Upshifting occurs automatically as long as the accelerator pedal is fully depressed. Launch Control is available again only after a certain distance has been driven.System limitsThis transmission has an overheating protection mechanism, which protects the clutch from extreme stressIndicator lamp lights up yellow: transmission too hot. Avoid high engine stress and frequent starts.▷Indicator lamp lights up red: transmission is overheating. Further driving at a moderate pace is possible. At the next opportunity, stop the car, shut off the engine and allow the transmission to cool down. Avoid fast starts, and on inclines did not accelerate lightly while letting the clutch slip; otherwise, the transmission may overheat.During traffic jams or at very low speeds, use the Low Speed Assistant, refer to page 75.",

    "content": "Anybody ever come across any flow tests on the different designs of catless downpipes online? Some are very fat and shank down quickly like the Wagner then you see the gradual smooth taper units like VRSF. I would think the VRSF would produce better flow charatistics but just curious if it even maters. The Wagner look at first glance like a catted pipe even though they are hollow which mine be better for visual inspections.\n\nSmooth tapering makes a significant difference.Back in NA days, everyone works on smooth and equal length header and see increased power without boost.That's why HJS dual chamber 300 HJS design flows very close to 200 cell or catless. Dual chamber doesn't have the radical taper as single chamber does.One more thing - exhaust flow really needs to be high volume (aka big enough boost/power) to take advantage of freer flow downpipe. Just like when reaching a certain point, enlarging pipe to have less back pressure make no power. Either restriction is somewhere else or back pressure is little enough for the power it's making. That is to say, maybe stock downpipe or 300/200 cell is free flow enough for what we desire from downpipe with our power level.You check M3/M4 board and everyone in the know will tell how useless, power wise, catless DP is to S55. It's just making more noise that is lacking in S55.Better check out more NA stuffs, that's when pure flow science happens. Now the turbocharged era, boost dominates the rest and too much things got mixed up.",

    "content": "Does anyone truly understand this valve?My understanding is that it makes the car run richer. Therefore there are more pops and burbles when it I is open. That's why the car is loud when it is cold. Best performance with the stock exhaust is with the valve closed.So why does it open in when traction control is off. Why would BMW want the car to run rich in that situation? Does Sports+ do the same thing?\n\nUnless I'm very much mistaken the valves aren't fully open when TC is off, at least they aren't to my ears. They are only fully open in traction mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we talking about the valve in the back? Cause I'm pretty sure that has zero effect on the amount of burbles \"generated\", it'll simply muffle it if it is closed.As an example, I have a valve controller that gives me manual control of the valves. The burbles are decided on which mode I'm in, rather than the valve being open or closed.\n\nThe valve is there to help increase/decrease exhaust volume and regulate back pressure as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^^ andrewc89 nailed it pretty well.The valve behavior may well change with drive mode (I don't know if anybody has mapped this out), but it's not the only thing affecting the sound. In fact, it's not very noticeable at all - I have the AWRON, and I've messed around with the valve control to try to figure out what is happening. When sitting near a wall, you can hear the valve open or close.  The modes go Auto -> Open -> Closed.Sitting at idle, after the car has gone through the cat-warmup period, the flap is actuallyopenin all drive modes, including Comfort.\n\n\n\nFound this.

    "content": "Since the N55 is octane limited on most tunes, does adding booster always increase performance or are the tunes set for specific octane levels?For instance, if a tune is set to run on 93 will the tune adjust and add power if you add booster, or does adding booster just prevent detonation?If more power, what’s the best bang for buck booster out there? Any ill effects from using it all the time?\n\nWith Octane Booster you will see a 10-20hps  more... it would adapt to whatever ECU orTune you have.\n\nI run crappy California jet fuel 91 octane, so I tried 91 + 3 gallons of VP Racing 101 (100 Octane race gas). Then tried a Stage 2 93 Octane BM3 map, I see some timing pull but not sure if it's octane related just yet will have others review after the following:I purchased a bottle of BOOSTane octane booster, the professional version. $30/bottle, I have a code for a little discount PM me to get it off of their website.I've done a lot of research on octane boosters, no doubt they work! Terry at BMS has used it,Norcalmav23has like 15,000 miles of use on every tank with his FBO + PS2 M2, he's also in California so he has crappy 91 octane too. My only concerns are the effects of MMT. But I think I am comfortable enough to give it a shot. So soon I hope, I will throw some 91 octane in the tank + a bottle of BOOSTane and will do some logs with a BM3 Stage 2 93 Octane OTS map. Lets see how it does, if it works good...then I will proceed to do a custom 93 octane tune using octane booster.I hear the side effects are orange residue on the exhaust tips. If you have a catalytic converter still, it might clog it? My main concern is Spark Plugs and O2 sensors as the by product of MMT after combustion leaves a orange residue on everything. Is it bad? I do not know. BOOSTane says MMT is similar to lead in a sense where it acts as a lubricant. ALSO, BOOSTane has something special about it that keeps the MMT in suspension at all times (check out the youtube videos). They claim due to this, you won't have fouled spark plugs and overly orange coated parts. Why, because with other octane boosters apparently the MMT settles and then large quantities are being flown through your fuel system which causes it to have massive amounts of build up = fouled plugs.That makes sense.Norcalmav23is living proof that there are no ill effects other than orange residue. I don't believe he replaced his spark plugs either yet.I've tested this myself, I have purchased BOOSTane before I got my M2 and purchased another brand of octane booster called RACE GAS Concentrate (probably similar to Torco). I poured both into separate glasses and let it sit outside all day. MMT is light sensitive so it turns a different color. BOOSTane turned brown as expected but the ENTIRE solution was brown, RACE GAS Concentrate turned brown BUT everything settled at the bottom (just like the youtube videos). So there's that too.I know the name brand octane boosters such as BOOSTane and Torco, 100% work to raise octane! Not sure if I believe their mixing charts however, it says 1 can of booster with 13.7 gallon tank of 91 octane = 101 or 102 octane LOL. Hmmm IDK about that, I'd say maybe about 96ish+ octane (seen some test results of Torco on another forum).That'll be the whole can, but I believe norcalmav23 uses half? Or maybe more, not sure and he's on a custom 93 octane tune!So I hope to have some results soon regarding Stage 2 93 Octane OTS of 91+100 octane VS 91+Octane Booster (BOOSTane).I think you can always benefit from a little extra octane with any tune, of course it'll eventually max out and just provide the best knock protection.Hope this helps!\n\nReviving this thread, for tuned cars running close to 400-whp, does octane booster help mitigate HPFP crashing? Or, no impact? Or, make things worse?For instance, would adding some booster or race gas help keep the HPFP from crashing on track days?\n\nDon't think it will help your HPFP...... I never saw a change in pressure delta between target and actual. What it helped with was timing pull until my IAT got way too high\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Updated on Apr 28, 2017 - The drone is gone forever. Today I just realized, it's been a couple weeks I didn't hear drone. Tried hard to look for it, it's nowhere to be found. Kind of miss it...------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------HJS Euro 6 Downpipe was installed at Christmas of 2016. The thing really turns up everything in a pleasant manner without compromising anything whatsoever from stock. Truly a mod that you'll be appreciating and never get tired of for the length of car ownership.See my review here:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1339166MPE, on the other hand, is deemed by its maker illegal in its purest form. An amazing sounding system few six pots can match, I'll give it that. But it comes with imperfections which you'll have to live with. Out of spending one week with it, I make a list of my findings:1) Drone - My prayer wasn't answered. Didn't get away with that. It drones the day of install from 2500~4000 under heavy load, though things were getting better pretty quick - the range gets narrower to 3000~3500 as of today and volume decreased already to an acceptable level. Sport mode was even slightly better. From time to time the drone seems little to almost gone even in track mode but that's inconsistent. Out of drone range it's sounding nothing but spectacular. I am expecting it self cures over time. Already ordered ASD bypass hoping it works. I will update.2) Startup Vibration - Yes it vibrates, which I anticipated and had addressed. Result is no noises can be heard or a negligible one if you stand behind and look for it, not an issue at all.Two measures:a) Tighten up tailpipes screws harder than installation manual suggests - it's the source of noise.b) Weld up pipes and clamping bush - one piece is less prone to vibration.BTW, forum members here reported a two-time vibrations at cold start but my car only vibrates once and for a short time (3 secs or so) - I guess it's the welding of pipes/bush that neutralizes one of them and lessen the other.3) Unlike a downpipe amplifying stock sounding, MPE is much of a differently tuned system. In higher rpms where stock gets muffled a little bit, MPE opens it up with rawness. At down low and in between, MPE presents more clarity while stock system goes deep. Those characteristics are very prominent in track mode, making an acoustical pleasure all the time on the road.4) On loudness. I'll confess, yesterday I activated track mode and unplugged the BT control module. That's how it stays in track, permanently. I did it because of what's said in #5 below. Remind you, I consider myself a conservative guy in judging how loud is too loud, track is not too loud. And that is said with high flow downpipe fitted, especially when you have stock comfort in place and are staying below 3krpm where F87 has plenty of torque already for normal use unless you want Tesla's push which m2 is not able to give anyway. In this sense, I have no idea how people who cannot live with track mode day to day bought a MPE in the first place.5) Compared to stock system, MPE in Sport mode is slightly louder at middle & top end, at cost of down low deepness from stock that everybody absolutely loves. You'll feel it the most the sec engine's lighted up in MPE sport - the sexy deep breath is gone. The track mode, however, makes a day and night difference, it wakes up in a mighty roar with burbles and crackles, which is definitely more exotic and attention drawing. But from the bottom of my heart, I still miss the refinement that only stock system can give.6) A trivial thing - there is very slight sound \"shoooo\" from exhaust when window down (please hear it from the video, from 13~17 sec). It sounds like the pipe is sucking/blowing air or something (or leak?). It's there when you look for it and more noticeable in the garage. Is anyone out there experiencing the same?In summary, with all those imperfections, HJS & MPE combination captures a perfect balance among all dimensions and IMO is \"the system to beat\". I heard many, if not all, different systems for F8X, most of them cannot make low end charm without being raspy at top end, you can easily tell in few rev-ups that they're simply much less refined. In my 30 ///M meet last weekend, many F8Xs came with much louder systems, but there was a general consensus that my car claimed the crown and blew away every single one of them.Check out the sound clip.First half is all about burbles and crackles when lifting off at below 4500k, the other half is me redlining it. Though for sure high revving would be even much better on the fly.\n\nIs the drone from the DP or MPE?\n\nSounds exciting.  I'm pondering to opt for a fabspeed or hjs combing with the mpe.\n\nSounds good with the dowpipe. Quick Q: how did you 'unplug' the BT to let the valves stay open?\n\nSeanWRTdid you install the DP after the MPE? (were you able to judge the MPE independently before installing the DP?) Curious as to how much volume as added with the DP on top of the exhaust\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for the review OP\n\nThanks for the vid, time to save up for it ///\n\nGreat honest review...thank you.What is it like with valves closed and lower range rpm?Basically want to know when just trundling around, is it like the stock exhaust?And in MDM valves open....?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSound great !!\n\nUpdate:I remove the ASD last week. It's got quieter overall, but in cabin sound quality improves, especially at down low - there is no fake engine load noise on top of real one when you're just being gentle on gas below 2000 rpm, not in the mood for noise. On the other hand, you hear more from exhaust, which is purer and more raw. Downside is at higher rpm, high pitch may be lost a little bit (or it's just all in my mind as difference is minimal I can't tell for sure). I really like it for what it actually is. In summary it's definitely the right thing to do.It's been 2 months and drone is still present though minimal and sometimes gone completely. I think I must be out of my mind to say this: I love the drone and kind of look forward to that little noise when revving it up...Having compared many enough F87 sounding systems in real life, I am very confident coming to this conclusion - MPE+DP is THE BEST setup BY FAR. I must have many crazy friends tolerating nothing but the very best - three sets of this below were ditched in mint condition in past 2 months because of what's heard side by side in comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to update you guys - the drone is gone forever. Today I just realized, it's been a couple weeks I didn't hear drone. Tried hard to look for it, it's nowhere to be found. Kind of miss it...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for the perfect review...I was ready to order akrapovic but i will trust you and order your setup..",

    "content": "Hi Guys - anyone have this installed and if so, how did you like or dislike it?\n\nI have the Dinan Stage 1 Performance Tune and the Dinan Cold Air Intake.  Two great mods that you can definitely feel, but don't impact driveability at all.\n\n5k is ridiculous.  I have the sport tuner ($200), resonator delete and rear exhaust.  The sport tuner is pretty good for the low price for a street car, it's completely worthless on the track though as it starts cutting out at high rpm's.  The exhaust is pretty tame, you get more pops and burbles but it's barely louder than stock otherwise.I would go straight to an aftermarket downpipe and a real flash tune like Hex or BM3.\n\n\n\nDinan is overpriced but the tune is solid and you have that piece of mind at the end of the day. I had the stage 2 installed for a little and I was happy with it. If anyone is interested in Dinan I know a dealer who gives great deals on them.\n\nDinan the famous dont want to affect my warranty tuneMany have had no problem using the various tunes offered with better results when it comes to the dealer. 1600.00 is ridiculous for the results.\n\nI still have dinan stage 1.I can say a few things like the guys pointed out, its expensive, mainly because of the warranty, but other than that you can get the same performabce improvement or even more going with a different route.I do feel the extra HP, it added about 20 more, and and bumped the torque. I opened a thread long time ago regarding this and sure at 1st we made the mistake of testing using the comfort mode so it was being throttled by the car, once in sport+ the car changed noticeably from stock.Here is the threadhttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1343899Another thing about stage 1 is that you get a discount if you decide to go big with the next stage, so there is that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have the full Stage 1 Signature, got it last fall. Couldn't reccomend it highly enough. Make sure you get the resonator delete it's the gene se qua to the exhaust. It really turns the car into something special. I was really underwhelmed by the cockpit feel on the stock M2 as far as being connected to the engine and feeling the rumble. Stage 1 has totally fixed that for me while still being very dailyable. Suspension is night and day honestly. By comparison to stock it's like you hit mute when going over smaller bumps. SO much flatter and confident. The exhaust w/ delete IMO is only rivaled by the GT350 and supercars. It's really really good.People will say you can get the same gains for less money but those options don't have DINAN quality control or warranty. There's more that goes into kits than just the parts themselves or a dyno sheet. There's throttle remapping and all kinds of technical details to consider for longevity. There's a reason DINAN has the reputation they do (even if Steve sold it off a little while ago).If you want to see what cutting corners gets you go look at the dyno sheets for PURE's turbos on the M2(not test, on a customer car) somewhere on this forum. It looks closer to a seismograph than an accelleration line or any normal dyno sheet i've seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nTry 200 cell + res delete + stock muffler mod. 1.5k in parts sends you to moon.\n\n\n\nPeople that bag on Dinan, people know it is overpriced, but most dealers will install and work through issues.\n\nJust wanted to provide an update here - had the Dinan Stage 1 installed yesterday and I can tell you...it really made a difference.A brief description would be a very noticeable smooth power gain. I chose Dinan because of the warranty deal and the less of a chance of throwing a CEL light.Very pleased w/ this tune.",

Does replacing them actually do anything, or is it just peace of mind?If beneficial, which are the best on the market?As an FYI, I’ll probably go with the Dinan larger turbo soon. Thanks for the input.\n\nThere are three pipes that you can / could replace:Turbo Inlet PipeTurbo outlet to intercooler pipe, often called 'Boost' PipeIntercooler to throttle body pipe, often called 'Charge' Pipe.The Charge pipe is a weak link from a reliability perspective, and it often cracks, leaking boost, even with stock mapping.The Boost pipe is rarely changed, because the stock pipe is well made and flexible. There weren't many aftermarket options for this eitherThe turbo inlet pipe is said to offer benefits, enforcing for upgraded turbos, but some say even for the stock EWG turbo as well.\n\nI changed all three.  Heard the charge pipe was prone to cracking although I never had an issue with my 335.  Wanted to try out a tune this go around with the N55 so figured it couldn't hurt to change them and was doing the IC anyway...just thought of it as preventative maintenance.  Not that expensive compared to other mods.\n\n\n\nWasn't the charge pipe issue a decade old issue that got fixed?\n\nHas anyone out there actually had an issue with these pipes on an M2?\n\n\n\nI just did the VRSF charge pipe when I changed my intercooler (CSF) and intake (CTS)\n\n\n\nLooks like there are charge pipes out there from VRSF, FTP, CTS, ER, AA, aFe, and others, and everyone has an opinion on each one...Doesn’t sound like the boost pipe is worth doing.What about options for the turbo inlet pipe? I’d do this at the same time as the Dinan turbo upgrade. Just FTP & Pure?Thanks for the input, guys.\n\nIf you are tuning the car, Charge Pipe and intercooler are a must.Turbo to Intercooler not charge pipe not needed unless you are upgrading your turbo",

Flash to stock and lock the DME, replace the stock Cat, boost and charge pipes and FMIC, and then take it in.I'm not doing this to try and preserve drivetrain warranty per se. If I had a drivetrain issue, I wouldn't claim on the warranty, but if I have an unrelated issue, for example the amplifier going out, or adaptive headlight fault, then I don't want to have already been red flagged for my drivetrain mods.I do all my installs myself anyway, so it's only going to cost me time (and scraped knuckles) to do this once a year.\n\nI flashed my friend dm3 in front of his SA at dealership.I talked with dealership mechanic on O-rings and gaskets I need for turbo swap and ordered them.\n\n\n\nOh, I've heard my dealer is ok, but you can never be sure. Service Advisors and managers change all the time, so there is no guarantee that your mod friendly dealer today will be friendly tomorrow.I'm not going in blind, just trying to reduce the possible hassle. If I need to make a claim and I think it's reasonable, and not related to my mods, then I'll try.To be honest though, I don't expect to be making claims. The most common issue within the warranty period, and besides recalls, appears to be the amplifier.\n\nI'm not sure I've been \"flagged,\"  but my service rep knows I have a Dinan piggy, knows I have a catted DP, and knows I've done a bunch of convenience coding on my car.  Hasn't batted an eye.Of course, I never turn in my car to anybody but him at the dealership, for any purpose.

Not sure if I will be going with Eventuri intake... that is pending in my head.Question is to which one to go with;Bootmod3 Stage 2VF Engineer HEX Stage 2Dinan Stage 4 + Big turboBelieve HEX gives best results shown from different Dyno from the threads. But there is no installer available in my area (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). So I will have to travel to US with my car to get the mod done. If something happens?? I dont know if I can bring the car all the way cross the border to revisit to fix the car? That will be a big issue.Bootmod3, yes there is an installer here but result is not as satisfying as to HEX tune (at least according to my resarchDinan, They were great until 3 years before Dinan stepped out of the game... They become lazy, especially their stuff made for M2 which is not much different from M240i gears. Installing them on M2 gives significant pain as it will need a lot of cut of stock braces that contributes to car's rigidity especially when installing FMIC and Intake. That is why i just want their \"big turbo/ ST4, and maybe fuel pump kit\".Good thing about Dinan is that they will cover my ass if something goes wrong with the parts and any malfunction associated with the mod made from them.BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE!!I wish to hear good and bad of those three choices of tuning I mentioned above from forumers that have been running their M2s on Autocross/ Track and hoping to aid my decision.Any feed back will be much appreciated guys!Thanks in advance.*Edit: Let me know if I am missing anything crucial on additional aftermarket parts that would need for STG2.\n\nI believe you can install the Hex tune with your own computer these days.Initially, you used to have to take out the ECU and ship it to them, but they've  changed the way it gets installed and now you just need to connect your laptop to the OBD2 port and flash it with your laptop.I was never keen on having to take the ECU out myself and no installer in Edmonton, but now it seems pretty easy to have it installed yourself.I'm just waiting for my package to arrive now\n\nCan't answer your question re: tuning, but had a question for you re: your Wagner plans.  I'm thinking about their EVO 1 Comp....what was the pricing you got for the EVO2 and from where?\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\nFunny thing is that installation charge of Dinan STG 4 and Big Turbo, Fuel Pump kit (not including the actual price of stuffs) from one and only Dinan certified install dealer in GTA, is just about the same as the amount that you will be paying for your goods.... which i find ridiculous IMO....So the price that you will find doing Dinan (and fact that my stock fuel supply system will be very bad and insufficient when it goes lower than the quarter from full tank) will be more than double of any other mods that you can do. (I know it will upgrading the turbo, but does it worth? I dont know... Their dyno result is just about the same level around with BTM3 ST2). However, you get the badge hahahaha and decal on your windshield along with warranty... lol\n\nThis is more about the type of power curve you want and how you’re using the car.If you’re just driving on the street, do one of the tunes.If you’re hitting the track often you’ll feel the car lose power up top and you can only cure that with a larger turbo.\n\n\n\nBtw, some food for thought, re Dinan and BMW Canadahttps://www.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1422170\n\nI did the OBD flash version of the Hex Stage 2 tune, believe me if I can do it you can do it.  VF is very supportive, I just overthought the installation to death, it really is rather easy and I'm no spring chicken, you young guys should have no issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not looking for a custom tune and just want strong reliable off the shelf maps, you should also consider Active Autowerke.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will go BM3 if I make the move\n\nHex since its a plug n play, don't need to worry about anything. That's why I got itAnd if you need help with your laptop vf is a pm/call/email away\n\nNot many speak truth like I do these days. So keep these in mind:BM3 OTS makes most power plus smoothest power delivery on recent versions. BM3 is a small tuning team (everyone else in the business is the same), but they work hard for a long time to cover full F platform. Their improvement relies on local testing and global users' log feedback, which has been 2 years.You can trust OTS of current maturity and set and forget it, but best would be to keep up to date as they update tune all the time.VF hits you hardest at down low and middle range but power gain tapers from 5k5 and diminish at top end because they tune to 91 oct. Some say it's for saving the pump, which is not remotely true. Their OTS stresses the pump hardest, to be safe on knock side, I am one of in the know.In conjunction with significantly dialed up throttle sensitivity, perceived power is more than it actually is.Find my thread to see VF power curve.Dinan STG4 kit is the most balanced setup, has good power under the curve thanks to its slightly bigger turbo, but peak power is lowest of the three, because piggyback can't really sort out M2 top end. Real world performance should be close I suspect, though nobody really tested it. Also many report it's inconsistent and put you in limp from time to time. Root cause is, bmw incorporates many extra nannies with M2 top end with a higher state of tune from factory. To unlock these restriction is no easy job even with flash tune. By comparison M235 is much more consistent on similar boost, that let me tell you.Warranty you can retain of course and that matters to a lot of people.The biggest downside is of course the high cost, especially the extra labor with turbo. I'd recommend this option in old days when it took DME unlock to flash, but guys it's 2018 now, everyone port flashes, it's cheaper and better.",

This allowed me to run my Dinan software in Stage 4 the entire session with no reduction in rev limits or power!

    "content": "Over the last couple of weeks I've been looking at datalogs of my car with various BM3 OTS maps, and also with the stock map, and I'm finding a very worrying data point.I've documented a lot of this in another thread, so I won't repeat all the data here, but to summarise:I was finding 'Knock Detected' events in my data log with the Stage 1 91 octane OTS BM3 map, so I switched back to stock, logged again and found similar 'Knock Detected' events with the stock map.Various forum members told me that I must have 'bad gas', and I was skeptical... I was filling up at Shell or Chevron, and large gas stations, not small ones. I've also deliberately filled up in different stations to avoid what might be a station passing 87 off as 91.In order to test this theory though, I made a 3:1 blend of Sunoco SS100, which has an AKI of 100. (91*3+100)/4 = 93.25. I then took logs again of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 91 Octane OTS BM3 maps.The 'Knock Detected' events disappeared, which seems to confirm the suggestion that the pump gas I used wasn't up to the task, but I was still getting a lot of timing corrections.I had 2 gallons of SS100 left, so I decided to add this to the remaining few gallons in my tank, to get me to a theoretical 95.5 AKI blend. Again I captured logs.This time, the timing corrections, while still present, were much more in line with what was expected, but keep in mind that this was for the 91 octane OTS map, and my tank had what should have been 95.5 AKI fuel...I've now had Halim take a look at all of my logs, and he's saying that based on his experience, it looks like the pump gas that I'm using has an octane of around 88 AKI, even though it's being sold as 91!I know that CA (or ACN - Arizona, California, Nevada) fuel is known to be not as good as the rest of the country, but 88 performance when being sold as 91, is that even possible, or legal?I also know that there are a few forum members (e.g.UltraMagneticALandtehboost) who are based in Southern California, and anecdotally appear to have 91 AKI fuel that isn't quite as bad as in the bay area.My larger concern, is that our cars were designed to run on 93 AKI, and say 91 AKI minimum inside the fuel door and the owners manual. I'm seeing 'knock detected' events A LOT with standard pump gas on the stock map, which isn't a good thing.I'm actually worried that the fuel in the bay area may be causing long term damage to forced induction cars evenwithout any modifications, and owners are simply unaware!There are three main oil refineries in the bay area:Chevron in RichmondShell in MartinezValero in BeniciaIt would be interesting to know which stations use which refineries, to try and see if one or more of these is producing 'bad gas' compared to the others.I guess it should be obvious that Chevron stations are using gas from the Chevron refinery, Shell from Shell and Valero from Valero, but what about the others? 76, BP, Mobil, Arco, Costco, Independents etc.Does anyone know if there is a way to have gas tested? I'm serious enough to say that there might be a class action law suit that could come out of this, if it's found that we're being sold under performing gas.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much.First of all, 91 is the MINIMUM octane rating. The owner manual states that you could experience engine knock at high temperature start ups. And yes, you may experience less performance with it.The RECOMMENDED octane rating is 93.As you can tell by your own experiment that one it two octane points make the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnot sure how engines work but is it possible you had a bad fill up of gas in the past and you have some bad deposits resting in your tank for awhile?\n\n\n\nThe state Dept of agriculture is usually interested in fuel quality...I'd reach out to them\n\nDo you feel anything when you have \"knock detected\" or is it only noticed by the logs? I don't have BM3 so I'm not aware of these gas quality. I'm always filling Shell V-Power. It seems to be doing ok.\n\n\n\nOuch.. that's no bueno.Yeah I'm also in socal and I don't get any of what you see. The shell VPower+ Nitro station by my area generally has very good fuel quality.If you have bimmerlink and a OBD, you can measure the fuel quality realtime and see what type of power it is pulling. Or also use ISTA+ to measure your fuel quality over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote:This makes it seem like tuning in the bay area or CA at all is foolish if you're going to use pump gas, maybe even driving a car that requires premium in this area is foolish?That's exactly my concern. I'd love to be wrong, but I've not yet found a gas that works correctly in our engines. I do still have Valero to try, as that's the third refinery in our area. I'll also try Shell again, but it wasn't any better last time I tried.Quote:If it runs out they're selling 88 gas as 91 that seems like a news story.Highest prices gas in the country, second highest taxed gas in the country, but this most expensive gas in the country sold as 91 is really 88?Exactly my point... I have my own selfish reasons for getting to the bottom of this - getting the best out of my car's tune, but with that aside, it seems like it would be a massive conspiracy if it turns out to be true.The irony would be that our poor gas is supposed to be 'better' for the environment, but prevents cars from running more boost, which makes them more efficient, which is therefore bad for the environment. I realise that in our cars, the boost is used simply to get more power, but the trend these days around the world, but particularly in Europe, is to down size engines, and add more boost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoure threatening a lawsuit against the oil companies (who have a team of lawyers, good luck) because someone on the internet said you might have 88 octane fuel? Do you even hear yourself? Id venture out on a limb and guess the car would run fine on 87 so long as youre not tracking it exclusively.",

    "content": "I figure there is no need for further description of this downpipe, given the title, other than the manufacture part reference number: HJS 90 81 2010, fitting all N55 powered 35i and M2. Also find another review on M235i application at:http://www.2addicts.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1160714It isn't as popular as HJS 200 cell Euro 5 high flow downpipes, so I had no luck sourcing it from USA. Fortunately my wife travelled to Oberkochen, Germany in early Dec and got this thing from Lightweight Performance. I cannot think of a better Christmas GiftAnd special thanks to Marc with Lightweight Performance for getting everything ready in advance.If I want cat, I want THE best cat, hence HJS Euro 6 it is. The reasons why I chose it over the 200-cell one (Fabspeed, Supersprint, Miltek branded) are as following:1) Flow capacity difference is minimal. 90% with 200 cell, vs 80% with 300 cell, according to HJS.2) Emission Compliance guarantee. The Euro 6 cat, not only 100 cell denser, but also twice as long thanks to dual chamber design, makes three times as much catalyzing area in total (1.5 times in density, multipled by 2 times in length) as a 200 cell does. Provided catalyst can fail overtime, 300-cell should be more reliable in long term. The tradeoff is 10% less flow that most  cannot even take advantage of.See the attached dual chamber vs single chamber comparison picture (OEM vs Fabspeed)3) Minimal Smell. I don't know what it would be like with 200 cell, this is my experience with 300 cell:At cold start, there is a little smell if you stand close behind looking for it. To be fair, stock cat was every bit the same. There is no increase in smell whatsoever.When warmed up, it's ZERO smell.And more, HJS metallic cat warms up much faster than stock ceramic one, which means overall it OUTPERFORM stock cat in term of smell.Box open, HJS screams Akrapovic quality. BTW, there is a Akrapovic branded 300 cell Euro 6 dp as well with same design, same details, same spec, same certificate, same everything. Most certainly made by HJS.Needless to say, the fit is Akrapovic spot on. My mechanic, one man, did it effortlessly in less an hour after engine cooled down. To ensure no leakage, I bought all the associated clamps &amp;amp;amp;amp; bolts - the turbo end clamp is not reusable in replacing downpipe for its prone to getting loose according to BMW.HJS downpipe instantly felt very \"OEM\" on the car with the silver heat wrap matching surrounding nicely, making the stock DP it replaces look like just a good quality aftermarket part...The car started with clearly a louder roar with rawness. In driving to warm the thing up, I noticed turbo response is sharper. Not to mistake with throttle response, it's the less time it took to spool up to give you SERIOUS push. I did a few WOT pulls when car's fully warmed up. The torque in middle and low end is noticeably improved. Unfortunately it still falls at top end like stock.Now the sound. The freer flow cat really opens it up and gets it significantly louder throughout the rev band. The best part is revving it up to above 5k and hear a higher pitch sounding where stock system gets just muffled. And it definately burbles and cracks louder at mid and low end. In hidden exhaust (MDM+sequential) mode, it sounds just too good for a turbo engine burbling from 1500rpm. Overall, I reckoned the dp makes a 30% louder exhaust system.I met another m2 guy at car wash the other day and confirmed everything I felt. Comparing my car to his side by side, what a big difference in sounding... Then I took his car out for a joy run and he took mine. Well, I clearly noticed the stock m2 of his is less torquey!My MPE is coming and will be installed in 2 weeks. Can't wait to see how HJS works with MPE! Will post a good sound clip.Thanks for reading! Happy New Year to you and your beloved ones!SeanUpdate: review and sound clip of MPE cat back + HJS DP:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1346405--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks Sean for your review, I've got the same dp and I hope to put it on the car soon.\n\nDo u know how I can buy this DP from US?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo issues on our end either with our HJS 200-cell cats.\n\n@SeanWhere is the promised sound clip?\n\n\n\n\n\nShould be interesting.. might be following this route to go CEL free.http://www.babybmw.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=74&t=84130MPE has been ordered but available from March onwards... love to heard the combo with the HJS downpipes..\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Sean I too was inspired and installed the HJS 300 cell catted DP.It really opens up the N55 and even the stock exhaust sound is augmented beautifully.Best mod for sure as others have attested too!\n\nJust a heads-up guys. According to one of dealers by installing a custom downpipe you lose the warranty for two components:1. Exhaust (no big deal).2. Engine :/\n\nWhat is stock cell count? I've read 700 and 400.\n\nLooks like Fabspeed has the same dp? This will fit the M2 right?http://www.fabspeed.com/bmw-m235i-f2...tted-downpipe/\n\nYes, that's the same DP.  I'd much rather have the HJS 300 cell catted DP because of lack of CEL, higher quality build, and most importantly, it looks like an OEM part.  FS pushes their DP obviously so that they can get more money selling your their own part.\n\n\n\n",

I haven't read any reports on this unit at all.\n\nI have one that I bought used from another member on here, but haven't installed yet, mostly because I want to get the tips powdercoated black or maybe wrinkle black, and at least one side doesn't come off the backbox I don't believe.The section that goes under the center of the car is made up of a bunch of short pipes that all V-band clamp together. Better than other clamps, but IMO not as nice as just one or two bigger pipes. (Check out the install guide on their website for more info.)The previous owner told me the Magnaflow wasn't loud enough for him, which has me hopeful that it will be \"Goldilocks\" for me. I want a bit more noise than stock, and hopefully a little deeper tone, but I don't want to be setting off car alarms everywhere. I'm 37 and daily drive the car and I've mostly grown out of acting like a bellend.\n\nThanks\n\nWe got a brand new one",

    "content": "Hey guys,We've mentioned this feature in the past as something we've been working on adding and it is now available in the editor. OTS maps that we provide as FREE which are basically OEM like calibration data can now be used as really great reference points if you have a desire to learn how to tune on this platform.In the S55 case you can import the GTS, CS and CSL OTS maps. On the N55 EWG you'll have access to the M2 map and on the S63tu to the Comp Package (600hp) map. We'll be adding others where required as well for those looking for any further references.As an example, you can open your Stock Tune first in the editor, do \"Save As\" to make a copy of it for custom tuning reasons (stock tune itself cannot be edited). Once you create a map, name it as you wish and proceed to the editor to import one of these OTS maps that you find most appropriate/intriguing and go from there. Editor will highlight tables changed in 'red' between your stock and the imported map. If you click on any given 'red' table you can hover on and off the button called 'Original' and see changes in your original (stock) map and if you hover off you'll see the imported changes inbold.Let us know if any questions at allHere's a quick vid we put together to demonstrate how its done:\n\nIsn't this feature useless for us M2 owners? There is only an M2 stock map that we could import.I understand that for other EWG N55 owners, seeing the M2 map might be interesting, or for M3/M4 owners, seeing the GTS, CS and CSL maps might be interesting, but for M2, we only have 1 map available.Am I wrong?\n\nYes...unless we have a learning map such as from an OEM N55 EWG that isn't as turned up as an M2 and you could compare the approach that way\n\nThis would have been an awesome tool if we had the ability to see the paid OTS stage 1, 2, etc. maps and use them as a baseline to compare to the stock map for tuning. As is, it doesn't really provide any value for M2 owners.\n\nHow do you turn off cold start? I select it to \"off\" and save the changes. Does that do it or need to reflash? I tried both and cold start still happens. BTW, i am just choosing my ots maps: stg 2 93 gas v5, not sure what im missing.I do have cold start rpm as \"OEM\", not sure if that needs to be amended.\n\n\n\n",

What's very interesting to me is the differing views and philosophies from the companies and the drivers on the aged old question of double clutch vs manual transmission.So the 981 GT4 was basically a 2 year car in 2015 and 2016 and only came in a 6MT. Porsche exclusively sells PDK double clutch now in their high end GT cars but the GT4 broke the mold. They do offer manual in their GTS versions and lower in the lineup but only PDK on their top shelf GTs including the GT3, GT3 RS, and GT2 RS. Now the rumors are flying on the new 781 GT4 due for the 2020 model year. And what's the hot topic??? Everyone hoping that the new GT4 will be equipped with a PDK instead of a 6MT. It needs to be a proper GT and have a PDK. No manual allowed. That seems to be the general sentiment anyways.I just find this ironic given the seemingly opposite feeling at least among the BMW community on this forum. Mention a DCT vs 6MT and the emotions run wild on how anyone could consider the DCT.I've driven both the 6MT and DCT late model BMWs as well as the GT4 6MT and a 781 GTS PDK. All four of the transmissions are very good with relative strengths and weaknesses.Just thought I would share this tail of two cities. In this case Stuttgart and Munich.\n\nHave you overlooked the 991.2 GT3 (manual option) & GT3 Touring package (manual only)?  Manual trans are taking up approx 30% of GT3 saleshttps://www.caradvice.com.au/599017/...d-with-the-rs/\n\n\n\nWould it be fair to generalise that track 'times' favour PDK/DCT & driving 'enjoyment' manual?  I have one friend with a GT4 who does more km's on the track than road and would have preferred a PDK and another friend who doesn't track, had the last of the manual GT3RS's, manual 911's, then tried a PDK and got bored quickly.  He's now ordered the GT3 Touring package (manual).For me a manual trans gives me more enjoyment without having to break land speed records.  Down here getting caught doing more than 30kp/h over the limit sees instant licence disqualification, more than 45kp/h longer disq. and immediate cancellation of car registration (meaning you have to get it towed), not to mention $$$$ fines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n991.2 manual GT3's just started becoming available recently all the 991 GT3's you see are probably .1.  I don't know of anyone that is hoping the GT4RS is PDK only but it's likely since RS models are more about speed and lap times = PDK and non RS = fun and driver involvement = 6MT.  I personally want MT for both situations, I was super bored driving my GT-R on track with a DCT.",

    "content": "I know that Datalogs are a vital thing for tuning, and also to asses the general wellbeing of your vehicle.I've posted several times about my recent BM3 experiences, and I feel like I'm starting to understand things a little more. It's a steep, but interesting and exciting learning curve.I'm not expecting to become a tuner, but I'd like to understand a little more about the various things typically logged in a Datalog, and what conclusions / suggestions you can take away from the data. Some are obvious, and some are not.As far as I'm aware, there is no definitive articles or forum threads on this, so I guess I'm offering to write one and I think everyone in this sub-forum would benefit. Having said that, I'm not an expert by any means, and therefore need some help from others.I'll be updating this first post as more information is added... Let's start:BM3 Default Logged DataAccel.

In these cases the most common gear to use is 3rd, as a compromise of the speed reached by redline in this gear, and the duration (and therefore data points) required to get there. DSC Off should be selected. Try to capture logs from 2,500rpm up to redline at Wide Open Throttle (WOT).Interpreting DataThere are many things to look for within a datalog. Perhaps the easiest way to break this down would be to look at a logged data trace, and its relationship to others at the same time.IATAs the turbo charger compresses air, the temperature of that air increases. This has a negative impact on the combustion process, and can contribute to the onset of pre-ignition or knock. The Front Mounted Intercooler (FMIC) on our cars is intended to reduce the temperature of the compressed air, but is considered slightly undersized for our cars.In a datalog, you would typically see the IAT temperature rise during a hard pull, and then provided the car is moving, and therefore ambient air flowing over the FMIC, the temperatures should drop when coasting or cruising. It is not unusual to see the IAT increase when stopped, because no air is flowing over the FMIC and the FMIC is mounted close to the hot radiator.One thing to look for in the datalogs, is if the increased IAT is causing the engine to reduce power. Look for reduced timing advance when comparing two pulls with different IAT levels. If the timing advance is reduced when the IAT increases, it would be worth looking at your FMIC setup to see if there is anything that can be done to improve the situation.TimingTiming can be one of the most useful indicators of engine optimisation. In basic terms, advanced timing (starting the ignition process before the piston reaches top dead center) can improve performance and / or economy and / or emmisions. Retarded timing (starting the ignition process after the piston reaches top dead center) can create burble sound effects.Very advanced timing is often used when not much power is required from the engine, such as when cruising or coasting. Under heavy load however, very advanced timing can cause pre-ignition or knock. This is where the air fuel mixture, rather than burning cleanly as a controlled flame front starting from the spark plug and progressing through the combustion chamber, instead ignites in multiple unpredictable places around the combustion chamber. Knock is bad for engines, and can be prevented by reducing the timing advance so that the spark starts combustion later in the cycle, at the expense of torque.As you look at the datalogs, ideally you should see your timing consistent across all 6 cylinders, and maintained throughout the rev range and throughout the pull. If the timing of all cylinders deviates significantly, or the overall timing drops unexpectedly, this is a sign of the engine protecting itself and therefore reducing power.STFT & LTFTIn normally aspirated engines, a stoichiometric mixture is one that is 14.7 parts air to 1 part fuel to create the air/fuel mixture (AFR). Obviously, one that has less air is richer and more air is leaner.. .in NA engines, the most power generally occurs when the AFR is a hair richer than stoichio.Now, engines with forced induction require a richer mixture.. Turbos turn up the heat, and a mixture often between 11.5 and 13/1 is required to cool things off and keep knock at bay .. If it runs lean and hot, knock risk increases and timing will be pulled, both of which loses power.So, back to the fuel trims.. The STFT is calculated on a momentary basis and when logging, you will see rapid variations as it shoots high, and then low to dither into the best mix.. Over time, these values get inculcated into the LTFTs through the process known as Adaption. These are useful for diagnostics in that if the trims tend toward too rich or too lean, there could be an issue with various sensors, MAF, O2, or vacuum leaks, or a tune that is not maximized for the conditions.creditboostm3Please comment if you see any errors, and please add to this post by offering additional explanations. I'll copy your text into the first post and give credit when I do.\n\nReserved in case additional space is needed.\n\nSTFT is your short term fuel trim - its short term adaptations the ECU is making to the fuel table usually measured in Lambda - usually environmental / different gas / etc etc.Lambda is your AFR - the proper way to measure AFR is in lambda.\n\n\n\nNezil, maybe my eyes are failing me, but I dont see an entry in your compilation for LTFT (Long Term Fuel Trim) ?  This value is crucial for examining the influence of adaption on your other values and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I just worked out that Ignition Cyl 1[deg] is a trace of the map's timing target. The Ignition Timing x[deg] traces are for the actual timing for each cylinder.I'm not 100% sure this is correct, but looking at a number of datalogs, this seems to make sense.\n\ncookiesowns, are you able to provide some help with this thread?I know you were reluctant to give advise on tuning, but tuning requires an understanding of datalogs, and there is less risk associated with sharing that knowledge, and it's equally, perhaps even more valuable!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I guess I could ask dealer tomorrow, but just did not know if anyone knew an answer to that.\n\nNever mind, google search worked better then the search here. sorry for the duplicate post.\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of people are quite afraid of voiding their warranty\n\nFirstly, you won't void your \"entire\" warranty (electrical, suspension, etc.), only the parts affected by the aftermarket parts.If your turbo breaks and they notice you have a aftermarket DP installed, they will most likely try to blame it on the DP and you may have to play out of pocket for that.Of course, that is the best case scenario. From what I've read on the forums, BMW could deny your warranty anytime they want if they feel you've done mods to your car (from datalogs or visual), and you'd have to take them to court to resolve the issue. During that time, you can't drive your car as it will be considered evidence. So going this route will be inconvenient and expensive.\n\n\n\nIt also varies from dealer to dealer to a large degree.Some are more mod-friendly than others. Typically, in my experience, if you can find one that is still a Dinan dealer too, they tend to be more mod-friendly.\n\nGoing into the dealer with a DP showing a CEL could lead to a red flag, or if you have a tune and it masks your DP and they see it then they will flag you then. You might not know it at the time but you might find out later.....\n\nNo since it does not add any stress on other car components",

    "content": "I mentioned in my post about my experience with BM3 Stage 1 91 AKI OTS tune, that I would make another post about how the BM3 ecosystem works, because this wasn't clear to me before I bought my license, and I thought it might help others who are 'on the fence'.I believe MHD may have a similar system, but can't comment with any first hand information.OK, so with that said, there are three major parts to the system:Web Based Client UIOBD AgentCloud ServiceWeb Based Client UIThis is the main user interface that you use to interact with the system. Even if you have the Android / iOS app, it's basically just a web-page that makes use of some less well known features of web-pages to look for the OBD Agent over the local network.The app based versions of the client UI do have the ability to allow you to connect without being online, and they do this presumably with a cached set of pages that provide a subset of the full online set of functions.OBD AgentThis is a separate piece of software that handles the communications between the Web Based Client UI, the various vehicle ECUs using an E-Net cable, in much the same way that E-Sys does, and the Cloud Service.The OBD Agent software can run on the same laptop that you're using to run the Web Based Client UI, or a different laptop on the same network, or any compute device that is able to communicate with the vehicle over E-Net, the Cloud service over the internet, and the Web Based Client UI over the local network.The most common implementation is the OBD Agent Hardware Device, which is sold by ProTuningFreaks. This device is actually a Raspberry Pi 3B in a nice case, loaded with their software, which itself is a typical Raspberry Pi Linux build, pre-configured to auto start their OBD Agent software.The OBD Agent has the ability to cache tunes that you've purchased or had created for you by a custom tuner. It also has the ability to flash back to stock and lock the DME, and to backup a flash that you might already have. I believe you could, for example, backup a VF Hex tune, then play with a BM3 tune, then flash back to VF Hex again all in the BM3 ecosystem.The best thing about the OBD Agent Hardware Device (I built my own from a Raspberry Pi 3B, saving a lot of money), is that you can leave it in your vehicle permanently potentially even permanently connected to the OBD port. If you do this, you'll always have the ability to change tuning maps, using your phone as the Web Based Client UI and a WiFi hotspot. You'll also have the ability to create datalogs whenever you want. For these reasons, I'm planning to hide my Raspberry Pi somewhere in the dash and leave it plugged in permanently.Cloud ServiceThe cloud services handles licensing (activating your vehicle in the ecosystem), authentication (when you log into the Web Based Client UI), and perhaps most importantly, manages the tuning ecosystem.OTS maps are available for download from the cloud service, and will be downloaded to the OBD Agent device before they're flashed. Custom maps get sent from your tuner to the cloud service, and you submit messages, requests etc. through the cloud service as well.The cloud service also hosts the datalogs, assuming you are doing an online log, which can then be viewed by anyone you give the link to.I'm sure I've missed a lot of things, glossed over others, and got some things wrong, but this would have been helpful to me a few days / weeks ago when I was choosing a tune, so hopefully this will be useful to others.\n\nthanks for this post, and for referring me over here from the burble post.  Definitely helpful.  I have an older Raspberry Pi and an enet cable lying around and may want to give that a rip as well.Can you answer the question about removing the cold start?  Basically, if I use an OTS stage 2 tune, can I independently remove the ridiculously loud first 30 seconds?  That's almost worth the price of admission for me, but the added HP (via boost?) is super tempting as well.  Ultimately I'd love to have something that I can revert to that just works, but it would be fun to dink around and see what playing with the different variables can do.Where are you in the bay area?  I'm in San Rafael.\n\nNeil,I have logged offline and when I returned home they were on the cloud.

You can choose from OEM (Which means there is a cold start) or OFF. You also get the chance to change the revs at which the cold start routine runs, so you might choose to compromise and keep the cold start, but keep the revs down.Quote:Where are you in the bay area?

    "content": "Hey guys, I was wondering, would I be able to get a downpipe in July/August and not tune it until March/April? Would this affect my car at all?Or should I wait till I'm ready for a tune?EDIT: The downpipe is the fabspeed Sport Cat Downpipe (catted obv), and also the Muffler Bypass by Fabspeed\n\nShort answer: no negatives other than emission none compliance which you may or may not care.Long answer: short term trim will be adapting until long term one settle. You will have significantly louder exhaust note and improved turbo spool up for increased toque at low down and a bit mid range as well. At top end DME will adjust to pre set air filling to maintain peak output, so no power gained there.Last word - down pipe power gain on stock tune is massively exaggerated by vendor. Even on flash it doesn't yield you a delta anywhere close to these claims, provided you're not modding crazily enough.Good luck!\n\n\n\n\n\nAny gains from just a DP is a result of a small increase in airflow or decrease in pumping losses at a given rpm. A 3-5 g/s increase over the rpm range wouldn't be unheard of depending on how restrictive the stock one is. Its a bit of inexact science to relate airflow g/s and hp but generally more airflow = more fuel = more power combustion at a given point.The other effects are quicker spooling of the turbo and lower EGTs. These factors allow for more aggressive tuning.I don't doubt the fabspeed graphs and I haven't looked at the details, but you have to take into account the ambient conditions between the two runs, as well as other factors in the DME such as: was it running max timing advance both runs? was overboost enabled on both?\n\nWith all due respect, do not spread misinformation.The 'air flow' as you mentioned is a pre turbo parameter measured by MAF sensor. Instead, our DME is really adjusting load by keeping MAP reading (measured post throttle) in check, which is completely irrelevant to turbo back design. To do that, wastegate, diverter valve and throttle plate are used at different times and different levels.DP makes power by 1) improving VE with lower back pressure, which with our platform is only noticeable when power goes way beyond stock, 2) early spooling up, so turbo makes boost or power earlier than it would without dp.When load target is hit (from 4k+rpm on stock tune) and DME starts to control power, DP isn't really helping, unless turbo couldn't achieve desired boost without DP, for example at elevation, or other kinds of bad condition.I will stop going deeper, English skill is my restriction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI knew that thread long back. I think you misinterpreted the results.Their stock baseline was 308ps on E30, uncorrected. And with a little heat soak as they say because that's the last run without DP.On HJS 300 cell, the best they managed to get is 318ps, or a 10ps bump which is partially thanks to better IAT.This link works betterhttp://www.babybmw.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=84130\n\nCouldn't agree more with the above post.I've just got home from having an HJS 300 cell DP fitted and there was a VERY noticeable improvement in throttle response and power on the drive back. It just seems to rev out more freely. This is coming from someone who didn't expect much at all.\n\n\n\nQuote:I’ve attached my graphs,first stock,second DP+MPE+ITG Panel Filter,third is with Wagner IC, HiFlow charge pipes, hi flow pure turbo inlet pipe.All on same dyno.Car has had zero ECU work, all the work/mods are just about breathing, it goes to show how good the N55 can run when it’s not restricted by a small IC, air filter, 600/800cel DP (cant quite remember stock) and skinny plastic pipes all of which have a tendency to crush under boost pressure.The dyno in question is at Surrey Rolling Road here in the UK with very good rep.This proves beyond doubt that m2 on stock tune responds well with the right combination of bolt ons......BP\n\nI'm speechless. Are you trying to tell us M2 gains 54hp crank power out of just full Bolt-Ons?Have you ever doubt a bit its legitimacy? It's exactly threads and people like these that is why all the marketing hypes have been going on and on.I can show you a delta of 30whp on same day same car dyno, with no modification at all. What would that make you believe?I can imagine how true tuners laugh out loud reading thread like this. Why am I even responding like I have a dog in this debate...why have I been consistent sharing anything technical at all...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it's okay to do? Damn lots of people but it won't hurt me at all right with stock tune?\n\n",

I'm envious!Option 1 - Octane BoosterOne option, of course, is to use Octane Booster, something like BOOSTane. This contains MMT, which if used incorrectly can cause excessive orange deposits on the inside of the engine / turbo / cat / exhaust. BOOSTaneclaimthat their proprietary carrier prevents the active ingredients from coming out of suspension, and it's this dropping out of suspension that causes traditional MMT based octane booster products to result in the excessive orange deposits.I've seen some CA based forum members use BOOSTane (or similar) with every tank, and some CA based forum members that say they used one time, and they had orange colouration on every part they looked at where the BOOSTane would have gone.Cost wise, if using BOOSTane Professional, you'd need 2.22oz to take 13 gallons from 91 to 94. If you buy a single quart bottle, that works out to just over $2 / tank. If you buy a 5 gallon pail, it's only $1.20 / tank!Option 2 - Race GasThe other option, is to use Race Gas. I found four locations in the SF Bay Area that sell Race Gas, none of them what I would call local, but less than a 30 minute drive.Two of these stations sell Sunoco 100 AKI at the pump, and other options in 5 gallon pailsOne sells Torco 100 AKI, and mixtures with regular 91 and this to other octane ratings at the pump, as well as other options in 5 gallon pailsOne sells VP Racing 101 AKI at the pump; I've not visited so I'm not sure what else they have availableI believe if it's sold at the pump, it has to be street legal, which would mean that the Sunoco 100 is theirSS100 fuel, which has a 9.5% Ethanol content.The Torco 100, if it is really 100, would be their un-oxygenated product, containing no Ethanol.The VP Racing 100 would be AKA Street Blaze 100, which is 'oxygenated' (contains Ethanol) at a 3.6% of Oxygen by weight, which is slightly more than the Sunoco SS100 (3.5%), so presumably a slightly higher amount of Ethanol, maybe 10%.I'm not really sure of the need to reduce Ethanol content, though it probably would reduce the demand on the HPFP that our cars seem to have as a bottleneck.Whatever Race Gas you choose, you'd need to mix with 91 at a ratio of 3:1 in order to acheive 93.25 Octane. 3.5:1 gives you 93 exactly, but you might want some headroom. A full 13 gallons in the tank would require 9.75g of 91, and 3.25g of 100.Current gas prices would put this at a approximately $63.90, a difference of $13.33 over a tank of regular 91; not insignificant, and you have to factor in filling up 5 gallon cans!Option 3 - Do NothingOf course, the most simple option is to do nothing. Research and feedback on this forum has shown that running on CA E10 91 AKI results in not just a reduction in performance potential, but actual measurable performance on a stock tune. In summary, our engines are octane limited from the factory, and they were designed for 93 AKI...That's not to say that running on 91 AKI pump gas in California isn't an option. If you feel that your car is fast enough and responsive enough on this fuel then great.tehboostwas able to get a custom tune fromproTUNING Freaksthat netted him around 400whp on the dyno, all on CA 91 pump gas - impressive indeed.\n\nI’ve been taking the race gas route (close-by 76 station has 100 octane VP).  I have a local hand car wash that does too, but it uses the same hose as the other gas, so a hose full of the 87 octane everyone else buys comes out first and I leave a hose full of my $9/gallon gas for the next car when filling is complete. I just stick to the 76 and wash my own car, better for it anyway.I started out mixing in 91 with the 100, but I fly to work every other week & work from home the rest of the time, so I’ve been enjoying the luxury of straight 100 lately, given that I only drive for pleasure and an errand here & there.\n\nIm running the BM3 93 octane stage 2 map. I have a Catless downpipe and was previously mixing 100 octane with 91 to reach 93 but I found a station near Pleasanton that sells 116 octane (its leaded so you have to be catless) so mixing 1.1 gallons of 116 with 91 gets you to the 93 minimum. It ends up being cheaper as well. My grand plan is to go water/meth injection so I dont have to worry about octane anymore.\n\nAdded a poll to see how this stacks up... I expect the majority of CA forum members just live with it, but perhaps not the majority of CA forum members that read the Tuning sub-forum...\n\nDo nothing!!!As you know, I made impressive power on 91 octane! JET FUEL BRUH!I did use BOOSTane for LITERALLY half a tank, when I removed the downpipe, catback, and O2 sensors...they were BRIGHT ORANGE. How the hell lol. I know others have ran it for a while, but there is no way that orange by-product is not affecting something. There has to be something negative going on, whether it be the spark plugs, O2 sensors, or something more serious. Also, I had MANY logs with 91 octane, 93 octane (3 gallons of 100 octane + 91 octane), and 91 octane + BOOSTane...PTF, SeanWRT, and a few others mentioned the 91 octane might be the one to go with. Although I was able to get more timing out of the BOOSTane tank, it is not consistent...I saw more knock events with it vs. plain old 91 octane. Also, I saw some of the worst timing pull ever with BOOSTane...and sometimes the greatest timing. It is simply not consistent.With the BOOSTane and 100 octane, I ran V4 and V5 Stage 2 OTS, 93 Octane maps.I used VP Racing 101 Race Gas (100 octane) and did some logs, totally not worth $10/gallon lol.I say just stay with 91 octane, or throw in 1-3 gallons of that SWEET CORN JUICE! E85, it does wonders, I did not try with my M2 (but I have a lot of experience with it, FBO WRX)! Just not sure if the M2 HPFP will hold up, I say increase the mixture slowly and get a custom tune.But if you want to stay safe and headache free, just stick to good ole' jet fuel, 91 octane.Use Octane Booster at your own risk, every now and then might be fine (I don't recommend it) but definitely not every tank. Do NOT believe their mixing charts or their BS marketing haha. Yes BOOSTane stays in suspension apparently (I've done the test in the light like their video), but everything turns orange...this is with LITERALLY 115ish miles of BOOSTane haha.IfproTUNING FreaksorSeanWRTremembers my logs they can chime in, I sold my BM3 license so all of my logs are gone as well (I think I deleted them tbh).But as someone who has done it all (apart from meth, but that's another headache although pretty cool)...stick with pump or get a new car lol!Good luck sir.\n\nIn addition to what Tehboost said above, I think good quality race gas is a good option if getting it every time is no hassle for you.Everyone has a reality to be faced with. With 91 you're missing out 10-20whp, but won't change the fact M2 is still a powerful and fun ride.\n\nPictures do not lie, stay away from octane booster. This is with ~115 miles of BOOSTane. Inconsistent. Smells like hell as wellThese pictures are from MY O2 sensors and Catback exhaustO2 Sensor:Catback Exhaust, downpipe mating side:While I don't have pictures, if the individual who purchased my Catless downpipe sees this, he can also tell you that the downpipe is BRIGHT orange lolMy exhaust tips had a rust/orange tinge to them as well, pretty sure after a full tank or 2, they would be orange.ALSO my turbo was BRIGHT ORANGE, like no other...it's not just a coating, it literally builds up.\n\nWow!I was considering boostane, glad I didn't go through with it!@tehboost what was the difference between 91 and 93 (or higher) on your setup? Since you're already getting 400WHP on 91 that's pretty impressive!\n\n\n\nNot sure if you considered this but methanol injection does wonders..and you don't have to worry about hitting the ceiling with fuel pumps on stock turbo.It's not as scary as people make it seem.\n\nAll MMT additive products do the orange thing. I have used Lucas a bit, it is one one the most tested additives on the net and have shown dependable octane increases test after test. No fouling or negative effects but it turns shit orange. I did most of my logs with some in the tank and BM3 guys loved the log results...... Just say'n. The stuff has been around for yearsNow i have started playing with the E30 map and corn. If I stay with E85 I have a case of the lucas to sell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I've been running the BM3 91 AKI OTS Stage 2 map for a few days now. I've been keeping an eye on IAT because I don't yet have my CSF FMIC installed... Ordered a couple of weeks ago, but still hasn't shipped apparently. Looking at the IAT data, temperatures creep up over 100 degrees pretty quickly with the stock FMIC, so I've been making sure not to do pull after pull after pull.Today I needed to fill up, so I put 3.5 gallons of 100 AKI Sunoco Race Fuel in, and topped up with Chevron 91. Whilst still in the gas station, I flashed the BM3 93 AKI OTS Stage 2 map, and went for a drive.The butt dyno difference is significant... especially at the top end. As promised, the 93 AKI Stage 2 map targets 17 psi at high revs, and you can feel it. Just asSeanWRThas said before, having power at high revs is so rewarding.I tried to get some datalogs of 3rd gear pulls in DSC Off, but I'm having some difficulty getting logs consistently. I'll hit start logging, and then stop a bit later. When I check the log, it seems to be from a different part of my drive. I had a great 3rd gear pull to redline tonight, but the log shows no 100% Accel. Pedal %. Fortunately I did get a log of some WOT, but it was at a point where I had to stop the pull at 5,000 rpm because another car pulled out in front of me. Later I got another longer pull, but I thought the same thing was going to happen, so let off the gas for a short period of time.So I know this log isn't great, but here it is for feedback:http://www.bootmod3.net/log?id=5afd0e84d10b435e87b2dc0eTiming seems to deviate from cylinder to cylinder under hard load, and IAT rises quickly obviously given I'm still running the stock FMIC. HPFP seems to hold up too; is there anything here to worry about? How do these logs look?\n\nI'm lucky to have race gas and E85 pumps within 10-15 minutes of me.My daily is a e35 mix with 91oct which equals just over 95oct.Sometimes I substitute the 91oct and use a race gas/e85 mix.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote:No issues with HPFP to redline even with 5th gear pulls (m235i 8at). Been running e35 for about 2 years daily. On track days I just run race gas from the track as I'm unsure how the pumps would hold up to the extra heat and use of a track day with e35.That's comforting to here.Quote:I calculate my mix at every fill up. On a completely empty tank you would mix:91oct (e10) - 9.13 gallonsE85 - 4.57 gallonsYou should use an e85 calculator each time. Takes 15 seconds using a phone app.I'm familiar with the e85 calculators, and I get the same values as you for an E35 blend if I had a completely empty tank... That usually isn't the case though, so how do you go about estimating the amount in your tank? Are the markings on the gauge good enough, and you try and fill up at 25% or similar or are you using something else?I've looked at the BMW Connected app, and it will tell you how many Gallons you have, but I'm not sure of the accuracy of this app either.\n\n",

    "content": "HELP!! My car has a CEL and is running really rough.  I've exhausted every solution I can think of to fix it and am hoping someone here may have a suggestion before I have to tow the car to the dealer and admit defeat.I have a lot of experience with cars having done engine swaps, rebuilds, and aftermarket turbos on Nissans and Hondas in my younger days. I stopped all of that and graduated to a BMW M3 in 2005. Yes, I'm old.  Point is, I know my way around an engine bay.A little history on the car for reference: In January I flashed my 2017 to BM3 stage 1 and have driven it for months without issue. I also made a few changes with Bimmercode including removing the nag screen and upgrading id5 to id6 lite. On 4/24, I flashed my car back to \"stock and lock DME\" via BM3 and took the car to the dealer.  They did an oil change and flashed the latest ISTEP software upgrade.  I then drove the car on the stock DME flash for a few weeks.Here's where the problem began: On 5/12, I installed a Fabspeed Sportcat and flashed the car to BM3 stage 2. I already had a new intercooler on order and figured I would watch the IAT's and not push it hard until IC installation.  Immediately after the cat install and DME flash, I drove to a Sunoco 10 miles from home and topped off the 9-10 gallons of 93 octane already in the car with 2-3 gallons of 100 octane race fuel.  As soon as I started the car back up after fueling I got a CEL and madethis forum post. I drove the 10 miles back home and hooked up my laptop and read the lamda codes below:Engine (DME)12B104lambda probe heating before catalytic converter, control cable disruption12B304No description available (this postsays it's a \"Lambda probe heating after catalyst activation: Line Break\")Since the problem began, I have also started receiving the following code:201101, DME, tamper protection, recognized program or data manipulationI understand the tamper code is likely the result of the dealer performing the ISTEP update and flashing back to BM3 as perthis post.  I can live with that, it's the lambda codes I'm concerned with.Can someone with ISTA+ run the codes above and give me the recommended suggestions?Since the CEL began, I have taken the following steps to fix it and none of them have worked:Clear the codes with BM3.I did this again after every step below.Double and triple-checked the lambda sensor wiring and connections including making sure the dark grey/black sensor is the top (first sensor from the turbo) and the light grey sensor is secondary further down.Flashed the DME back to \"stock flash and lock DME\" via BM3.Replaced the 02 sensor withthis brand new onepart #11787596908.Checked every single fuse.Re-installed the stock cat.Currently, the car is in stock configuration with the stock cat and stock DME flash tune.  Should I reach out to Fabspeed or PTF and see if they have ever seen a similar issue?  Without a solution, I'll be stuck taking my car to the dealer and bending over.Just to be clear, I'm not blamingFabspeed MotorsportorproTUNING FreaksBM3 for any of my issues.\n\nHi nothingman, sorry you're going through this.First off, sorry I won't be able to help but will subscribe to this thread as I've been considering BM3 for some time and am ready to pull the trigger.  Overdue actually, and I'll be watching this thread closely.  I already have the FabSpeed catted dp and will possibly consider running this setup (that is, sportcat and BM3 Stage 2) without an intercooler upgrade for daily driving duties and occasional glory runs but not hardcore track use.  I also have done all of the bimmercode changes you have.  I know this is a common combination and hopefully this helps in that the vendors will want to ensure that you're well supported.The one question I have for you is about when the CEL occurred.  In this thread you said after the trip to the gas station, but in the other you said it was immediately after installing the downpipe.  For troubleshooting purposes (i.e. step #1: what did you change last?), I would think that would be important.Hopefully you just dinged the o2 sensor or something and can replace it cheaply--that may be what I would do first, possibly replacing the dp gaskets if you pulled it out again.  But I'm also concerned, selfishly, about the tamper code.  I would hesitate to run this setup if that's expected.Best of luck, please post as you progress.\n\n\n\nhttp://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1318465\n\n\n\nSorry OP. Please tell us what PTF say.\n\nSounds like a downpipe issue, not a tune issue.\n\n\n\nThe more I think about this, the more I cant help but think the problem is DME related. I have the stock cat on the car. I know the O2 sensors are in the correct locations. I know they arent damaged, and the upper sensor is brand new.Do you think the ISTEP update combined with the BM3 flash could have caused a problem?\n\nI think your flash went bad, maybe istep related, maybe not. And I think when they hook you up to the computer, you are going to have warranty issues...\n\nDo you know what istep version you were before? You could potentially flash back to that earlier version, I believe E-Sys can do this, even though BMW dealers never will.Coding with E-Sys is very common, flashing istep less so, but it can be done. I know thatcookiesownshas some experience with doing this...maybe talk with him. The download packages are large, but if it saves you trouble with the dealer, I'd do it.\n\nDoubt it's ISTEP related. It sounds like a O2 sensor problem.\n\n\n\nJust a shot in the dark, BimmerCode has a couple recent updates, including earlier today (iOS) that includes \"Updated coding data for cars that received a software update at the dealership recently\"Can't imagine that coding anything with an older version would have caused an issue but if there was a glitch between the old version of BimmerCode and an new version of ISTEP, who knows?\n\nI was going to suggest getting a copy of ISTA+ up and running, so that you can take a (better) look at the error messages. I know BM3 has error message handling, but ISTA+ has a bit more information on the errors.For example... I have the center channel speaker unplugged, and that gives an error from the amplifier module that ISTA+ actually identifies as a failed speaker, or open circuit. BM3 just says unknown error.Another thing to try is looking at logs. I think BM3 has the ability to log the Lambda data directly from the O2 sensors, and this might actually show you an issue with one of them. I'm inclined to think that it is an O2 sensor because that seems the most reasonable given the symptoms. AsgtaM2said though, it could be the wiring or connector that's the issue rather than the sensor itself. Either way data from the sensor would tell you this.\n\nI may have had an aha! moment last night while laying in bed. Unfortunately, I cant test my theory until I get home tonight from workKeep your fingers crossed for me. Ill update the post tonight after my findings.\n\nHeynothingman, please reach out to our support if any help needed, here'a a link:https://bootmod3.atlassian.net/servi...tomer/portal/1Given the codes it seems to be an o2 sensor issue or potentially swapped pre and post cat o2s. Tune won't cause those codes even if we tried and you'll have them if you switch back to stock as wellAs for tamper, it won't be there if you flash back stock and lock. While tuned in it goes away as well unless you forget to wait after flashing and just start the car. In that case just a simple reflash and wait will make it go away. In any case let us know through tech support and we'll be able to\n\n\n\nNothingman, waiting with baited breath to find out how this saga ends.. last we heard, you had an AHA moment.. Spill!  Inquiring minds need to know.\n\nProblem fixed!!!I'm sure many of you saw this coming, so I'll just go ahead and provide this disclaimer:Yes, this entire experience can be summarized by telling you I'm an idiot. But that said, if this thread helps just one person in the future from making the same stupid mistake I did then it is worth it.Before I tell you how I fixed the problem, you should know the problem itself is glaringly obvious in one of the pictures in my very first thread of this post. I'm going to save the answer for the post below to give those of you who are curious enough an opportunity to go back to the first post and try to figure it out.\n\noh the suspense...\n\nNot familiar with the installation, so which wire did you attach incorrectly?",

    "content": "I recently flashed the BM3 Stage 2 tune to my car, and found the overrun burble settings to be way too loud compared to Stage 1.I know there are customisations possible with BM3 maps now, but I had some questions forproTUNING Freaksabout how they worked, and posted on their support forums.I thought Dzenan's response was worth posting up here in case it benefitted anyone else:First, my questions (for context):Is there any way to discover or default OTS map settings for burble, cold start etc? I found that the Stage 1 burbles to be pretty good, and that Stage 2 too agressive. Id rather not keep flashing with small changes trying to guess what combination of settings gets me to Stage 1 burbles.Is there a way to reset the OTS map customisations back to default if Ive changed them at all? There are options for OEM and Custom, but no DefaultAnd then Dzenan's response:I've posted in regards to burble on f80post and why it doesn't translate into sliders. Slider is a 1 dimensional control while there are multiple tables for burble that have to do with ignition timing which isn't 1 dimensional. As a rough approximation the aggression slider set to around 5-5.5 comes close to our OTS map. As for duration its around 1.5-2seconds and RPM min is around 1200 and max at 8000 (higher than redline just to not have a max).If by default burble settings you mean OTS map settings, yes, you'd use the OTS map dropdown. Our Stage 1 and 2 maps have identical settings for burble. Any differences there will/can be attributed to exhaust setup, values are identical.\n\nBased on Dzenan's response, I'm not sure how Stage 2 can be the same as Stage 1; the difference is pretty obvious in regular driving, though maybe it is based on exhaust valve position which he didn't mention.The other thing I noticed is that in a web browser, I have different options for Burble settings compared to what I have in the Android app:Browser:Android App:I'm using the Android app mostly, so hadn't seen the OTS option initially. I'm not sure why it's not there, but that does answer my second question.I'm now going to have to have a play with these siders and see if I can find a result I'm happy with.\n\nI'll be watching this closely...my wife heard the car today for the first time after I flashed it Sunday.  I was three blocks away.  Lol.  She was like, \"You better undo whatever you did.\"  Here's hoping you find a workable solutionNezil\n\n\n\nJust so you know....2 of our 4 dogs know when daddy is coming. They start barking\n\n\n\n\n\nLast night I flashed the 93 AKI Stage 2 OTS tune (testing 100 AKI Race Fuel blend with CA 91 pump gas!), and while doing so, also set the burble setting to OEM.I was initially sceptical of Dzenan's comment:Our Stage 1 and 2 maps have identical settings for burble. Any differences there will/can be attributed to exhaust setup, values are identical.But I'm now less so... Even with the OEM settings for burble, there is an obvious burble in Comfort mode, and a more pronounced, though certainly less than default OTS, burble in Sport mode.I'm inclined to believe that the differences between the Stock burble and the Stage 2 OTS burbles that I'm hearing are in part to do with the FabSpeed Sport Cat that I installed at the same time as the Stage 2 OTS map (as suggested by Dzenan), but mostly to do with fuelling and timing changes in the OTS maps.I say this because you can make the burbles much more aggressive by jumping on the gas and then lifting off quickly. This might be because of the timing position just before overrun, or the boost at that time, but either way, there are significant differences between Stock, Stage 1 OTS and Stage 2 OTS burbles with no other hardware changes.To my ears, the OEM burble setting is actually pretty nice with the Stage 2 map, so I'm probably going to be sticking with that. I'd say that in Comfort mode the burbles are similar to Traction mode when the car was stock (no DP, no tune), and in Sport mode, they're a little more aggressive and louder, but not much.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood updateNezilFor reference I also have FS Sportcat DP and MPE.  I noticed on driving into work today, that if I leave the exhaust flap in the closed position, then the cracks/pops on Comfort are gone...I only hear the \"burbles\"...the softer sounds.  But who wants to drive in Comfort amiright?  In Sport+ with flaps closed, the cracks/pops are less for sure but still there mostly on throttle modulation (i.e. letting off the throttle), and less so on downshifts.  Flaps Open ...is a gunfight ...plain an simple.So I will try setting to the OEM burble setting and hopefully I can open my exhaust fully.\n\nSo.....I was just looking in the BM3 UI, and I can see that all OTS maps have been updated 24 minutes ago to v5.3, with 'Burble Intensity Lowered' in the comments...The plot thickens!\n\nPerhaps we are not the only ones with \"sensitive ears\"...\n\nGuys,one thing to keep in mind:The M2 came with some over run, huge selling point that makes the car sound so cool......that is what the huge complaints of the F80/82 there was no over run.Then the comp pack came out and it had over run and everybody was happy. My point is you take over run, add a down pipe (catted or not) and add a tune that light calm over run just became a gun fight. Not a front line battle but still. So even if your back to stock burble so to speak, with added fuel tuning, down pipe, etc it is going to be louder and more burbly.\n\nI am on stage v5. Can't go back to the extreme gun shot burble after I messed with the settings, any idea guys?\n\n\n\nI flashed v5.3 of the Stage 2 91 Octane OTS map this evening, and left the burbles in the standard settings or to put it another way, didn't tweak anything.It sounds perfect now, very well balanced. Comfort is pretty much silent, with some slight burbles, and Sport is just enough to sound good. If you're gunning it, the Sport burbles seem to get louder, and there are some cracks, but not nearly as loud and aggressive as the 5 map.I kept a copy of the 5 map in my maps folder, just in case I want to go back to that. It's almost comically loud!\n\n\n\nYou can keep all the maps as just as long you don't delete it from your accountI also deleted very old v3/v4 but I had previously downloaded on my macbook and its only available in offline modeRIP to those guys who's wife control their M2 mods/etc/car-life\n\nHi Guys-A little (completely) off topic here, but I have a question about BM3 I was hoping some users could shed some light on.  I have a MY17 6MT, currently with FS catted DP.  I don't intend to upgrade the intercooler, or charge pipes or anything else.  Strictly for street use, so should not be an issue with high IATs.  I'm looking at BM3 Stage 2.So my question basically revolves around usability of the BM3 apps, both mobile and PC.   I'm a computer guy by profession and a car enthusiast by nature, but all of the settings, configurations, tuning parameters, etc., seem a little daunting.  Is it the type of thing that can easily be figured out with a little trial and error?  How much tolerance for the \"and error\" side of things is there?  And does each flash count against the 60 total allowed--is that still a thing?  And will I throw the \"modified ECU\" OBD error that could get me flagged at the dealer?In the past when I've hesitated on this type of stuff but eventually plunged in it's been fine, I was just wondering where this lies on the spectrum.  And is there any demo I can play around with?  Getting to see how it worked would really help put my mind at ease.  I'm also interested in removing the cold start and want to confirm that's there with BM3.Any help greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nYeah I'm personally not a huge fan of the burbles in the OTS map, and the burble controls don't give me enough of a granular control.So I've been mapping my own burbles on a custom self tuned map.There's well over 6 tables that can vary directly affect the burbles in dramatic ways. There's also logic involved that has to do with EGT, load% before overrun, etc, that isn't easy to understand, but you can infer from.I've planned on doing a writeup for self-tuning... but for some reason... I feel like the liability concerns would far outweigh the benefits to the community.",

Also, is there a way to clean up the existing logs? They look pretty jumbled up w/ all the plots on one graph.\n\nSuper illuminating. Thanks for this. Really good numbers on the BM3 OTS Stage 2 despite being limited to CA 91.\n\n\n\nSo youve deduced the boost is running that far below target due to fueling?I remember on the vws you needed to upgraded HPFP because it hit a wall.

Get yourself a custom tune with PTF! I'd be interested to check your logs. You can get the share link from the button to the right of each individual log (PM or post it).Also, each individual parameter underneath the log charts, you can deselect to clean up the graph.

    "content": "Hey guys, considering leasing an M2. Curious if there's an ECU flash to easily increase power? The engine in the M2 seems to be nearly identical to the M3, minus the difference in HP and torque, so I'm guessing BMW just detuned it? Is there a way to gain that power back?I found this one, but the dyno chart seems to radically change the torque curve. One of the main reasons I want the M2 is because you get full torque down at 1,400 rpm, which is perfect for those powerslides from stop. I wouldn't want to get an ECU flash if it meant the torque came in later.Any good ECU flashes out there that don't make the torque come later in the powerband?http://esstuning.com/m2-n55-e-flash-...ance-software/\n\nFYI, the M3 and M2 engines are not the same. The M3 has the S55 and the M2 has the N55.\n\n\n\nThanks guys. Appreciate the clarity.I'm mostly just interested in more low-end torque, so if a tune helps me get more of that, then great. Otherwise, wouldn't want to compromise the torque coming early in the powerband.\n\nYou want low end TQ, a high-flow catted DP paired with the Dinan boost control sport tuner is a simple, cost effective yet potent combo. You'll be easily at 400+ WTQ in the low rpm range.

    "content": "The recent anoucement of the release of MP parts for new M2C goes carbon crazy like no other in all time MP history. BMW is like taking apart the M2 CS and selling all its parts separately. Which is great.http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1492934There is no reason we're getting more jealous than we already are of the M2C, because all the stuff except for MPE they're about to release are retrofittable to our civic M2.I have made a consolidated parts list in the poll above with trivial parts excluded. Let's see what you will do and already have done.And share your thoughts in reply.\n\nMy thought on below what I consider core parts:I will do tailgate and M mirror, both of which are iconic and hardcore M elements that out base car is lacking.I'll also do a M2C front bumper retrofit because the lower half looks wider. I'll put on carbon front grille because it has a split look. Not a fan of one-piece grille.And 763m wheel/tire package when tire change is due. Gold it will be for my LBB. This package is an incredibly good deal compared to buying good tires and wheels separately.Suspension - already did. Great performance and aesthetic value for 2k+labor. You'd do a coilover anyway if it's not the MP.Brake, I'm not doing at this point because the upgrade brake line and pads serve me well for street and light track duty. 6-4 pot in red with 400mm disc is cool, but just seems a little too expensive for how much I need it.CB roof I'm not too sure because labor and high level of install skill are required.CB power dome bonnet, it's nicer and saves 11lbs on front. I will be waiting to see the real thing on car before pull the trigger. And I think our base bonnet is interesting enough tbh.CB fender saves some weight but is a downgrade aesthetically with new side grille in my opinion. Plus it's way more than a bolt on affair.So, I'll be looking at 2k(tailgate)+1.5k(mirror)+2k(bumper)+500(front grille)+5k(wheel pkg) = 11k in total. Damn...\n\nProbably gonna do the decklid trunk, the bonnet, and the brakes. Maybe the wing but I might go with the DTM wing I found, that's just me though. As for the front splitter, if it's able to be used on the regular M2, I'll probably go with that\n\nHow about a poll category for “None of the Above?” Then you’ll get a much more accurate picture of what the true market is for these parts.\n\nWait, Sean, for the front bumper, is it the entire front bumper? If it is I'm gonna do this, my front bumper has seen some shit from track and daily use, even with PPF\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm wondering if the MP splitter will fit on the normal M2 front bumper. The lower part looks the same as the M2C.\n\nEdison and lightweight already do a version of the M2C front splitter for our M2s. I believe based upon the M2 safety car\n\nHow much of an effect will the front fenders with air outlets have on braking performance/cooling (and weight)?I want the CF trunk - I assume it has mounting points for a wing? Im kind of new to this, but in general, is it easy to mount/unmount the wing? I would only want it on while at an event as I think its too glaring on the street.\n\nFor me:1. Wheels for sure looked great for some time, waiting for gold option for my incoming LBB LCI also.2. M Suspension - wanted aftermarket but I'm gonna lease this car only for two years so want to keep it as close to OEM BMW as possible.3. Maybe carbon mirrors4. Maybe brakes depending on the price5. Maybe new fenders if the air exhausts are functional and will help to cool brakes better.Not really a fan of all that CF, it's where they want to make big money on us and for me the weight saving is marginal, although could make our LCI weigh less than M2C by 100+ kg. Let's see the pricing\n\nFront bumper for sure- I always found the fangs a bit disportionalThe bonnet- maybe, if the price is the same as the Edison composite, I’d rather take the aftermarket, think it looks heeps betterThe boot- again, I think aftermarket looks betterThe roof- don’t want to lose my sunroof, so not an option for meWould love the brakes and suspension, but unnessecary as I don’t track me car for now\n\nF**kSeanWRT. I want all of them but I can only vote for one hahahaha.Okay I was basically trying to hypnosis myself to say okay my MY18 M2 is better!!! But now it grows that I am starting to fail my process.If MPE brings the SOUND, I might consider changing mine...All MP CF parts will count around more than 20k in total I am sure...Sorry my kid, daddy might just spend another money for his weekend track toy...\n\nWith all the new cool MP bits released, I actually still find that I don't need/want any of them.Although, I already have:MP Steering wheelMP Rear DiffuserMP Rear SpoilerMP ExhaustMP Side GillsMP front kidneysMP Shift knob\n\nI wish someone made a CF roof that works with the Moon roof...\n\nI don't think I will be adding any of the new MP parts to my existing CF diffuser.  The CF hood intrigues me as I would love to shave 20 lbs from the 40 lb steel hood, but I am afraid it'll be cost prohibitive to me.  If BMW wants $1K for a set of CF fins, I'd imagined the hood has got to be in the $3K range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI selected a handful of things including mirrors but only if I could find a reasonable price on mirrors eventually.  I am sure it's going to be super expensive but perhaps eventually there will be some good deals.\n\nJust noticed M2C front lip gets more votes than M2C bumper. But apparently new bumper has a different lower end shape and is required if you want to do splitter.\n\n",

    "content": "Not sure if you guys have experienced this, but when I pull into a pretty steep driveway at an angle, the inside tire lifts off the ground sometimes. When this happens, the car almost hesitates and makes a loud screech noise from the rear end. It almost feels like the diff gets confused and thinks it's having wheelspin so it cuts power for a second. Not sure what the screech noise is either but its super loud and my wife cringes every time it happens. Car is stock.Any ideas?\n\nI'm curious about this too. It happens to my car during the same situation.\n\nNot sure if this is the same, but when I pull into a local gas station (at an angle) with a fairly deep/large bump, if my clutch is engaged I feel a jerky \"bump\" (maybe the ECU cutting throttle, or the diff shifting power) - although I haven't heard the screeching sound yet. If my clutch is disengaged, then it just goes over normally without any drama.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoticed this past weekend driving through a gated community with many speed humps....the diff makes a horrible clanking screeching metallic noise after going over these bumps at 10 mph or so! I suspected the wheel became airborne for a second.Only prior time I heard that was making a sharp right turn onto irregular uphill driveway, as described in these threads,  with a small pothole on right side and giving it some gas. The diff wasn't happy! Not the stone in brakeshield..That I have also experienced.No issues on open road.  My diff was replaced under recall 18 months ago. I am encouraged by this thread in that it seems I am not the only one!  So either this is normal or we all have bad diffs!\n\nso funny. Mine does this too exact thing\n\nI wonder if the F8x m3/4 guys have this issue too.\n\nI get a few weird noises & wheel lift too at sharp angles to driveways- I chalk it up to short wheelbase and stiff frame, and don’t worry about it.\n\nThe diff may not be liking the angle at which it’s being loaded. Try a 90-degree turn into your driveway. Pull up with the driver’s side parallel with the curb and stop once you’re you’re halfway in front of the driveway. Then turn the front wheels full left andslowlyenter the driveway until you’re all the way in. If there’s no noise, you’ve got your answer. You can back out the same way - slowly, so you don’t twist or bounce the car on its suspension.BTW, this also works for vehicles that have front air dams with less than 4 or 5 inches of clearance. It’s the only way I’ve been able to get a couple of cars into my garage.",

    "content": "We just wanted to post a quick thread updating everyone about our new fin pack revision on our 5\" stepped street intercoolers. After extensive research and testing we've decided to upgrade both the internal and external fin packs on our standard cores in order to better suit the upgraded turbo solutions that have now become available.Any street or intercooler that has been ordered in the past couple months will already have the denser fin pack which is now almost double the density of our older fin pack. The denser fin pack offers a higher overall surface area which significantly increases heat dissipation and keeps the intake temps nice and low.Here's a comparison of the new fin pack:http://www.vr-speed.com/vrsf-7-front...2-e90-e92.htmlWe also have a new intercooler in the works which will bridge the gap in size between the existing street intercoolers and \"generic\" street sized intercoolers and our Race intercooler. By street sized I mean our street intercooler as well as the generic Wagner/AA/ BMS/CTS/eBay intercoolers which all are identical in terms of dimensions. This will feature the same HD fin pack as our Race HD intercooler which has proven to perform well on both the street and the track.For those interested in maxing out their stock turbo or upgrading the turbo in the future, our Race intercooler is currently the largest intercooler available for this platform and also features the highest density fin pack available @ about 20 fins per inch, pictured below. It's not uncommon to see intake temps actually drop on 3-4 gear pulls with this intercooler. and this fin pack is the same that's featured on Motiv's record breaking 1000whp N54 shop car.http://www.vr-speed.com/vrsf-race-in...i-n20-n55.html\n\nlooks impressive!

    "content": "Alright, so I had this exhaust installed. Keep in mind, this is just my first impressions. I have had the car back with the exhaust installed for under 24 hours, most of which I was asleep or at work. I have not tested the comfort mode yet or even closed the windows so far while drivingCold start up is quite loud and will possibly wake the neighbors, but it quiets down rather quickly so no big deal. The car sounds absolutely vicious with this exhaust in sport mode and any level of throttle. Its got a lovely roar to it and the pops and burbles are perfectly exaggerated. Loving the overrun although I know this is personal preference. I've seen that some people are looking to get rid of this, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. The sound is much deeper than stock and definitely turns heads. I've received quite a few compliments already in such a short time. I haven't been able to judge drone yet if there is any.As far as looks go, this thing is mean looking. I saw the Dinan video and I couldn't really judge since the lighting made the pipes almost blend with the diffuser. The video didn't really do the sound or looks any justice. When the exhaust is on though and you see it in person, you will be pleased. The tips are the perfect size. I like the 3.5 inch (90mm) ceramic black tips better than the chrome.I will post additional comments, pictures, a crappy video for sound(cell phone quality) and update this with my thoughts as I drive it more and have some time. I will look for drone(if any), comfort mode volume, volume for both windows closed, and anything else you guys are curious about.So far, definitely recommend considering if you're looking into exhaust systems.Little bit of an update here. The comfort mode is very subdued, but not too much with the windows open. There pops are almost unnoticable even though the sound and tone are still there without the savage volume. Its perfect in volume for when you want to leave less of an impression on the public. Also, with the windows closed, there is almost absolute silence and no drone at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a fraction of the price of the MPE....\n\nJust installed mine too\n\nMine was installed a few days ago and it's simply breathtaking. The sound it produces is spectacular. The comfort setting is subtle enough. The sport setting is thrilling, anytime you lift your foot of the petal it makes such a wonderful growing sound.I went one step above that and added a down-pipe( Fabspeed) yesterday and it takes all the aspects mentioned above and adds so much more volume. I will post videos when it stops raining.CongratulationClick821on your exhaust. I'm sure you enjoy it just as much as I do.Cheers!Dvuk\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos pleaseeeeee I'm about to go to my sales guy at BMW to order the MPE for his cost which is a pretty good discount he said still waiting on his price should get it within a few hours but if this is that much better I might just go this route. Thanks!!\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething else to consider...There is a 6 HP gain with the Dinan exhaust. And while that is all but inconsequential, it's still more than what the MPE claims which is 0 HP gain.Listening to the two online, the MPE sounds more refined but the Dinan sounds nastier and raw. It suites the M2 better because the car itself is more raw than its bigger siblings.\n\nHere's a quick reference for sound. Kept the RPM under 3k (around busy work offices)\n\n\n\n\n\nI always loved that Dinan was close to where I live. When I decided to upgrade from my 2011 335is to my 2017 LBB M2. I passed on the MPE because I wasn't sold on the sound and I finally got the Dinan Exhaust and Resonator. I thought that the clip on the Dinan site was representative to the sound I wanted...boy was I so wrong it is so much better in person, I am in love with this exhaust!!! I don't have to roll the windows down to hear the exhaust anymore when I am in sport mode. Thanks Dinan for getting the exhaust note perfect in my opinion. I love all the burbles it makes when decelerating in sport mode. I love how it sings when I step on the gas. In comfort mode its tame as the OEM exhaust that way I don't wake my neighbors and call attention to myself. Inside the cabin with the windows up it is just as enjoyable No loud cabin drone when in comfort or sport mode. The black engraved staggered tips makes the rear end look great.\n\n\n\n\n\nHas anyone done the Dinan resonator delete on the stock exhaust?  If so, was worth it? Noticeable difference?  Thanks\n\n\n\n\n\nCan someone please measure the quad tips (tips side to side, top to bottom) and also the distance in between the tips? I'm trying to make modifications for my m235i but my exhaust won't be here for another few weeks. Thanks in advance!",

    "content": "I recently installed a black anodized ER intercooler for my M2, and according to my P3 gauge, it seems the intake air temps have risen compared to the stock intercooler in stop-go traffic.Also it seems to be heat soaking as the temps only drop when I almost full throttle for at least 3-5s.When I part throttle or coast, even at highway speeds, the intake air temps seems to rise!What could be the issue? Could it be an install problem?I seem to achieve stock boost levels still...Sigh this is so frustrating.\n\n\n\nAbout 5 to 10deg C.The frustration is that the intercooler doesnt seem to be shedding heat.The temp seems to only drop on throttle, and rises off or at partial throttle. Even at constant speed on a highway.Could it be that the top part of the intercooler is blocked by the foam bumper?Or is the intercooler too near the radiator causing ithe intercooler to heat up even more?\n\n\n\nEvolution Racewerks claims their black anodized versions shed as much heat as their uncontested ones, but after this video Im not sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably heat sink effect. Since the stock intercooler is tube and fin it doesn't hold as much heat, and releases it more quickly. The bar and plate is probably getting saturated and then releasing it more slowly. It needs the help from the airflow when you're driving. Temps don't drop super fast, but they will over extended driving at speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow quickly does your intake air temp rise after a full throttle run?From 50degC, my intake air temp drops to 40degC after a full throttle run, but once I let off the gas it climbs 1degC went 2 seconds until back to baseline of 50degC.\n\nI found my answer:http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/sho...d.php?t=896552This owner also has an ER intercooler for his 320i N20 engine.And he has documented that the ER intercooler's intake air temperature starts off hotter than the stock intercooler, but on throttle/boost, the intake air temperature drops and stays low throughout the pull. This is what I have been experiencing.I have a few theories:- The ER intercooler is larger and is in front of the radiator and is possibly soaking up more heat from the radiator at low speeds/idle.- The end-tanks of the ER intercooler are aluminium instead of plastic, which could mean the ER end tanks are absorbing more heat- The black anodizing of the ER intercooler could be absorbing more radiant heat from the radiatorAll in all, I feel it is a worthy sacrifice where the on boost temps are so impressive (it drops with every pull and is sustained), and it is on boost/throttle that you need the air temp to be low.\n\n",

    "content": "As the title states, I installed a VRSF downpipe on my 2016 M2 over the weekend, and I am code free without having to tune my car. I used a mini cat from Big Daddie's garage, so there was no splicing of wires or anything permanently modified on my car. Best of all, the mini cat was only $50. So far I've put 200+ trouble free miles on the car since installing the downpipe. Total install time was 1 hour and 50 minutes from the time I drove it into the shop until the time it was ready to leave, clean up included.Now for those of you thinking, why even bother with a downpipe if you aren't going to tune the car. Well, I simply don't want to risk tuning the car. Sure, there's a slight possibility of warranty work being more difficult with a downpipe, but tuning the car takes that risk to a whole other level.My only reason for wanting the downpipe is for more volume. The tone of the car is perfect from the factory, but with so much sound insulation, it was too quiet inside car. I come from a history of vehicles with N/A V8s with longtube headers and straight pipe exhausts. I don't have $3k lying around for an MPE exhaust, but I wouldn't want that anyway because I really love the functionality of the valves being programmed into SPORT and COMFORT modes.VIDEO:\n\nAwesome. Do you still get the catless smell?\n\n\n\nWoohoo!!!

Plus, a lambda o2 sensor spacer does exactly the same (eliminate the cel) and costs a fiver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to put this into laymans terms so everyone understands the difference...a spacer moves the o2 sensor further away from the exhaust gasses, giving you a better chance of the sensor not causing a CEL. A mini cat not only acts like a spacer, but it also cleans the exhausts gasses before they reach the O2 sensor, just like an OEM cat. Being that it's difficult to reach and I don't like crawling under my car all the time, I paid the extra money to buy a mini cat, as it is going to have a much better chance of not throwing a CEL.\n\nI apologise if you felt insulted as it was not my intention at all.

(As a relative noob, the real question is whether I could handle more!) Luckily I live close to Active Autowerke and have spent the past 6 months slowly modding the car. I started with the charge pipe and intercooler, then the intake, and just recently added the CDP and Tune. The guys at AA have been an absolute pleasure to work with, and I trust them implicitly with my car.Mods:AA FMICAA CPAA Catted DPDinan CF IntakeAA Stage 2 TuneAA Matte Black exhaust tipsAdmittedly, I have yet to do any type of official testing (ie, Dyno), but AA has so I'm guesstimating the car is running about ~440hp at the crank, so +/- 375whp.I was lucky enough to get Active Autowerke's prototype catted downpipe after they had finished all their testing. I went with a catted DP for a couple reasons. First, I get headaches easily, so I didn't want to be dealing with more fumes, and secondly, I'd like to think I care about the environment. And after a couple hundred miles, no issues with a CEL.As you can see in the pictures, the size of the stock cat vs the AA CDP is significantly larger. For actual specs on the CDP, please ask the AA crew.The tuned car has an entirely different attitude. It's extremely aggressive relative to stock. I don't ever bother with the Sport setting anymore, I'm either in Comfort or S+.Comfort mode is delightful. The car has the aggressive rumble to it, without being obnoxious. It picks up very quickly when needed. It's by no means sluggish like it is in stock form.Sport+: Hold your horses, Roy Rogers! It's loud, aggressive, and most importantly, significantly faster than stock in every gear. While there are a few more mods I can do (bigger turbo, exhaust, fuel pump, etc), the idea of adding any more power to the car seems ludicrous. I feel like I've hit the sweet spot, and IMO, it's perfect. There's still occasional turbo lag, but I blame myself for not always shifting at the right times.All in all, I highly recommend Active Autowerke's product and service. I'm not here to shill, just a very happy customer.Much thanks to Andrew, David, Robb and Nick from AA. If you have any technical questions about the stage 2 tune, or catted dp, please post in this thread or shoot them a PM.\n\nHolding for future updates.\n\nPLEASE post some dragy times, dyno numbers anything.Did you happen to dyno your car stock?I'm just about to pull the trigger on AA Exhaust and their tune.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward\n\nI like AA for its creativity in turbo-back design. But this new catted DP is a huge disappointment. Inside and out it's just one more average DP thrown into market to grab some money that everyone else can do.A proper AA DP should have a 4\" inlet and 3.5\" outlet and a middle pipe 3.5\" in 3\" out, to fit stock 3\" system. This would be a great alternative for those who dont want to keep stock muffler.Lastly, HJS core should be the only acceptable cat option.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "So this past weekend I got around to installing my VRSF stepped street FMIC finally & took a bunch of pics along the way. The install is pretty much straight forward and not too complicated and the fit was spot on.Details:Under inspection it is well crafted and finished. The bar and plate design was nicely assembled and looks to have good fin coverage. The stock FMIC weight was 7.2 lbs and the VRSF was 17.4 lbs. Pretty beefy and ready to work.The inlet/outlets were nicely machined, and a really nice feature is the fact that the mounting holes were closed and they were just the right size to use the factory screws without adding washers. I attempted to take some internal pics but as you can see I failed. It is pretty much a OEM replacement drop in. Fit was excellent, I have no complaints what so ever. Looks to be a bargain at $380 retail.Install:1st you have to drop the lower plastic cover piece which is a breeze. Then pull off the inlet & charge pipe couplings. As seen in the pics when I popped out the clips for the couplings I put folded pieces of cardboard in to keep them from popping back closed. Not sure it was really needed but just extra security.Unclip the fan shroud from the bottom of the cooler, unscrew the two attaching screws and wiggle/pull out the OEM cooler. Just bend down the other flexible black plastic piece and it will slide right on out.Now when you install the VRSF cooler remember it is much heavier and taller. It will slide in where the other came out but will take a little patience and effort but you do not have to remove any additional parts. Just be careful bending the plastic bodywork piece down as not to poke the fins on the front. Also when sliding it in the cooler is much taller and will hit the black support bars sitting behind the lower inlet grill so be mindful when your cramming it up there. It will clear don't worry.Once it is in re-attach the mounting screws and pop the pipes back on. Rotate and tug on them to ensure they are fully on and seated. Now the cooler has those horizontal tabs on it for some reason prolly to attach to one of the other cars it fits but since there was no lower fan shroud attachment clips now I drilled two small holes in the fan shroud and popped on a couple of zip ties or safe measure and prevent any possible rattling. Now re-install the lower bodywork cover and your done…..easy peasy.No drilling, no cutting, no modificationsThat's it in a nutshell, shoot me any questions if needed or if you feel I left something out….enjoyhttp://www.vr-speed.com/vrsf-interco...i-n20-n55.htmlsales@vr-speed.com\n\nHmm. I haven't done ALL the IC research, but $380 is the cheapest I've seen.\n\n\n\nGreat review, thanks for taking the time to share your experiences!\n\n\n\nAny benefits installing this without a tune?\n\n\n\nCongrats and thank you for the review!\n\nI want this intercooler. Where do I go to get this pricing? Going stage 2. Doing so on stock turbo and catless DP. Just need the IC.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.vr-speed.com/vrsf-interco...i-n20-n55.html\n\n",

    "content": "So, we all heard of TechtuningFS and their S55 HPFP retrofit kit. While it's amazing and makes good power on stage 2 turbo (Up to 600 whp, with appropriate fueling) the hefty price tag is a huge deterrent for most of us.However, they got a new solution for some of us!They're releasing a HPFP upgrade for stock and stage 1 turbos, for a tuning headroom of up to 500 whp (again with appropriate fueling) for 2k, much cheaper than the 5k price tag of the S55 retrofit. The price includes all installation equipment and a base OTS tune from MHD or BM3 specifically designed for the HPFP.This is great news for us N55 owners, as we can finally take the fight to the incoming S55 M2's! The equal playing field Competiton is very much welcomed and I look forward to the N55 vs S55 battle.\n\nThe S55 will still have more potential.  Theres more to the difference between N55/S55 than fuel pumps.\n\n\n\nThere’s never more than enough...or enough, for that matter.  Still, would be great to be able to get more from the N55 before fueling becomes an issue.\n\nNot sure if anyone has seen this video on YouTube\n\nThat is awesome! Too bad my M2 is gone LOL.I will live through your build,SeanWRT, andEndeav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a photo of the new TTFS pump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom their site:It is currently on the TTFS M2 as well as a customer's track car in Texas that has a turbo upgrade from Pure Turbos:\"We have busy finalizing the testing and pricing structure of the TTFS Dual Fuel Pump Upgrade. Our upgrade system has been running on two 2015 BMW M2, TTFS' for almost a year and a customer's in Texas for five months. Both M2s are now running Pure Stage 2 turbos. Our customer's M2 in Texas is a road course car.\"The system is working well on the roadcourse.As for the power it will support that range is roughly ~600 whp.The system itself is a custom retrofit of the S55 dual HPFP system. The kit will include all the necessary hardware with much of it made up of factory BMW parts.Once this product is finalized and released later this year expect a price point around $5k.TTFS is also considering additional platforms for this dual HPFP retrofit in the future at a lower price point.http://tuningtechfs.com/blog/\n\nSingle DI (direct injection) pump is worth looking at because it's offered at a much lower price and can support up to wherever pump gas can take you. Using flex fuel, you will have MWI too which also support fueling and in conjunction of already upgraded single pump (assuming 100whp over stock pump capacity as claimed), could support up to near 600whp no issue. Meaning unless you go STG3 turbo for 600+whp, S55 dual pump isn't required.All of above, presumption is that you don't like Port Injection.\n\nVery true...... I didn't see any thing about a single. I will look again but that is a huge chunk of change for a pump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is pretty cool!\n\nBut 2k plus! JEEZ!!!!!",

    "content": "So I've been planning to tune my car for quite a while, and spent some time deliberating over which tuning package to go with.In the end, I went with BM3, and this is mostly due to customer service fromproTUNING Freaks, andmike@x-ph.com, as well as the support on this forum; I'd sent PMs toSeanWRTandtehboost.I was initially considering a VF Hex tune, but go no response from them when I left a message on their website, or a list of questions on the VF thread. I'm sure their tune is good, but there is no doubt it is on the pricier side compared to the other offerings.The other consideration that I had, was that the BM3 platform is likely to have more OTS tunes coming in future (there already is Stage 1 and 2 tunes for 91, 93 and E30), and the possibility of custom tunes if I want to go that route. I'm not sure yet the end game for my car, but it's nice to have those options if I want them.So, I got a BM3 license today, and I also have a CSF Intercooler and High Flow DP coming. I'm probably going to order an upgraded charge pipe, but that's about it for now.Since I have an E-Net cable from using E-Sys, I was able to get going with BM3 this afternoon. As a coincidence, I happened to have a spare Raspberry Pi that I was able to build up as an OBD Agent Device, so I basically had everything ready to go for the tune. I'm going to make a separate post about the way the BM3 system works. For this one, I'm going to focus only on the early thoughts of the results.I don't have the FMIC and DP yet, so I flashed the 91 octane OTS tune, and as expected, I got the Fuel system error. I hit the online flash and this cleared it right up. Then I went for a short drive...In summary... this is how I expected the car to be. The exhaust (stock) is louder, with more burbles, actual cracks at times, but most impressive is the overall performance when you're not driving hard.I'm sure a lot of people will question why I was bothered by this on the stock tune, but the fact is, I just felt that the car felt bipolar. It's was either pretty weak performance if you drove it gently, or really quite agressive if you drove it hard.My previous car was a Jaguar XF with a 5.0 NA V8. It had 385 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque. Most importantly though, it felt effortlessly fast. I'm not sure if the frustration I was feeling was due to throttle mapping, or turbo vs NA, but whatever it was, the BM3 Stage 1 OTS map has certainly improved my feeling about the car's performance.It's obviously still a turbocharged car, but I feel like the way the power comes on now is more linear. Comfort mode still has a little hesitation when you first pull away (my car is 6MT), but it's much more lively after that. I really found that the car is now fast to the point where you can't floor it unless there really is an open stretch of road; half throttle is plenty fast enough. I was concerned that the throttle mapping just put all the power in the first 25% of pedal travel, but that's not the case either, there is still more to give in the rest of the pedal travel.I need to drive some more, and I need to have a play with the settings for overrun burble, but for now at least, I'm pretty happy with the way it's turned out, and I'm optimistic for the improvements I'll get from the DP, FMIC and Stage 2 tune!\n\nCan you do me a favor and do some logs post shift with OEM burbles vs OTS burbles.On the car antilag is completly disabled ( WG is 100% open off throttle ) and causes quite a bit post shift turbo lag.\n\n\n\nNaw your log is active throughout....Turn off TC, and if DCT put in manual and do a 3rd gear WOT pull 2lk to 6.5k. Then turn log off , then a 4th gear, then a 5th gear if you have safe roads. Then last do a 3/4/5 pull shifting at about 6-6.5k.All WOT logging each separately so they can be reviewed\n\nWow...sound like I pushed you into BM3 club...I like STG1 OTS. There is little if any peak boost increase over stock, but timing is advance by some 3 degree and top end AFR is optimized. Plus, there is significantly more boost from 4k5 up applied, which makes usable power on WOT. The real world performance gain is much more than peak power delta indicates. And it leaves plenty of timing headroom, as boost is capped at as low as 15.77, making M2 N55 happy most days of year.Clear your mind a moment and think about what you really want. Maybe FBO on BM3 STG1 is the best setup there ever is for M2 stock turbo.\n\n\n\nGlad to have helped, enjoy!",

Well that's how i see it, If it would serve a bigger purpose of holding the car down then maybe it would be ok, But for looks i wouldn't go with this approach i would rather choose a larger duck tail boot or the current carbon fiber one and i think this would kinda be in the way when backing up the car :-) but not to say a BMW M2 CSL Wouldn't look like this or a GTS version of it but then we would be talking power outputs of around 450 bhp+ for it to help i guess.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks terrible with that spoiler\n\n\n\nI smell a lot of rice in this thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,I've had my M2 since November, and to be honest, neverfeltit to be that powerful in daily driving. I was coming from a 2012 5.0 V8 NA Jaguar XF, which though a heavy car (~4,079 lbs), had ~390 hp / ~380 lb-ft. A lot of this feeling has to do with throttle response and gearing, and the M2 feels quite a bit more 'alive' to me in Sport+ mode. The biggest difference was that the XF felt quick without trying. The M2 feels like you have to drive it hard to get the performance out of it.Anyway... I've been thinking about improving performance for some time, and that obviously means a tune. I'm also considering a hi-flow catted DP and upgraded FMIC, but it may be a month or two before I do that.I'm based in CA, and therefore have shitty fuel. The best it gets is 91 AKI, with 10% ethanol. There is pretty much no pure gasoline, and no 93 available. I know of one gas station about 30 mins drive away that has a couple of pumps with other fuels, but it's very expensive and a one hour round trip with our size tank makes it impractical. Of course there is the option of octane boosters, but it's not ideal, so I'mprobablylooking at a 91 AKI tune, which is disappointing.I have a number of questions that I had initially asked in the VF Hex Tuning thread, but got no response, so I'm now posting here instead. I'm certainly not tied to VF Engineering. The only reason I started looking there were that I'd seen a few YouTube videos recommending them, and Nik from VF sounds like he's British (like me), which struck a chord I suppose! BM3 also looksveryinteresting of course.I read in the VF thread that the Auto Start Stop feature becomes disabled by their Hex tune. I'm interested in having the car behave similar to stock, but obviously with greater performance. Is this information correct, and is there any way it can not be disabled, even if I opt out of the GTS Startup Roar feature? Is Auto Start Stop disabled with other tunes like BM3?What is your recommendation before taking the car to a dealership for service. My understanding is that it's possible to load the factory tune back to the DME, but I've also read that there is a limit to the number of times the DME can be flashed before it fails. I usually remove all coding changes before going to the dealer, and reset all errors. This might be a waste of time to be honest, it doesn't take long.I read in various threads that some tunes include a GTS style overrun. I'm not sure at this point if I'll like that feature or not, and if there are other features that might be 'optional' like this. Is it possible to get additional flash files for the different options so that I can make the decision?I found another thread that talked about carbon deposits stuck to the rear of the car. Not just the tail pipes, but the trunk lid. There was some discussion about additional enhanced overrun causing this, due to additional fuel being un-burnt and creating additional soot. Is there any truth to this idea?What happens to the stock Comfort / Sport / Sport+ / Traction / DSC Off modes with your tunes? Are the characteristics retained pretty much as they were before?What happens to the 'overboost' feature of the N55 engine with a tune? I assume it is lost because that overboost is effectively being made available all of the time.Are the Power and Torque screens updated with all tunes? My kids love watching that when they're in the car, and I'd rather that not be negatively affected by a tune. I'm fine with the scale increasing, but not if stage 1 only gets half way round the gauge now. Is the scale the same for Stage 1 and 2?I've read several posts fromSeanWRTsaying that the stock down pipe isn't a restriction on our cars for pump gas tunes, but this theory seems not to be the case simply because all tuners seem to mandate high flow or cat-less DP for their stage 2 tunes. What's the story with this?With the M2C launching soon, there seems to be a lot of discussion about increasing the N55 power to sort of 'keep up' with the new car's S55. I realise the S55 is way more tuneable than the N55, but looking to the future, if the HPFP bottleneck is removed, can we expect reliable higher states of tune without resorting to port injection (obviously upgraded turbo will be required), and will a tune like BM3 be more likely to be future proof in that regard?Thanks in advance for anyone that can help!\n\nExcellent questions. Want to know these as well. Though mine is a manual.In addition also curious about any warranty issues when bmw hq detects a tuned engine even when flashed back to stock.\n\n\n\nI don't have all the answers but I just got the hex tune...see below\n\nNo BM3 users want to comment?\n\n\n\nHi Nezil, I'll try help answer.1. Auto Start Stop is rather a coding feature than DME rewrite. You can easily switch it on/off via SYS or a few popular APP coder (bimmercode, for example). Anyway ask VF deliver the tune with it being on, if possible.2. Dealer visit with tune is a long debated topic. It varies largely dealer by dealer. I have modded BMWs since 2011 and never ran into issue with any of the 20 local dealers. My suggestion is, only with drivetrain malfunction, flash back to stock prior to visit. At the end of day, they will find out mods if they really try. In your case, you don't seems to be ready to mod far enough to risk DTML any time soon. Last word on it, every one pay to play. Buy Dinan if warranty matters that much.3. VF GTS style overrun is more aggressive than M2 OEM. But OTS is meant to please most of customers, not every one of them. If you don't like it, ask VF to retain OEM (not sure if they offer to do this level of customization), or go with another platform to begin with.4. Overrun can cause carbon residual on tailpipe but I never heard it's on bumper. But AFR and STFT are the biggest source of it, this isn't an easy thing to explain if you're not a tuner. Bottom line is, stock flash makes residual too.5. To my knowledge, VF OTS raises throttle sensitivities, so comfort feels like sport, sport sport+ and so on. It creates a perception of more power and many like it, though a few people from F80 board complained and wanted to change. It seems there is no fix to it as VF responded with 'there is more complex to it' without further explaining.BTW, while sensitivity goes up, shifting strategy is unchanged. There is no one other than BMW offering a transmission flash at this point.6. There is no overboost with any of flash tune in the market. Overboost is a silly feature to say the least. In old days it made headaches for tuning with piggyback therefore many of us unplugged MAF to disable it totally.7.  I guess yes. Ask VF to confirm though.8. Tuner wants downpipe, so your car has more headroom for boost and is more timing tolerable and more durable (less exhaust temperature) with heavy abuse. But from logs I have reviewed, our N55 can handle OTS flashes with stock cat. BTW, there is no definative line to separate stage one and two, just different degree of aggressiveness. And aggressiveness differs vendor by vendor.9. HPFP restricts power but not by much with stock turbo. Because octane is shortly the next (or earlier when tuned properly) restriction anyway. Consider fueling mods only when you're ready for bigger turbo.My take on M2 N55 vs M2 S55:There is no way for N55 of really matching S55, without fitting a STG2 turbo. My STG1 turbo slightly outperform S55 in ZCP form in winter, but I am 100% positive table be turned in summer. With our load based DME, I push to octane limit at top end, leaving little headroom for DME to adjust to ambient variance, meaning when higher boost is demanded to compensate less dense intake air, my timing would suffer. In the meanwhile, S55 in ZCP form is much less vulnerable to all of those and can maintain a consistent air filling and timing cap, and make uncorrected 400+whp 365 days a year.Only with STG2 turbo and supplemental fueling, N55 can match or come close to S55 stock turbo.Hope it helps.",

    "content": "Currently waiting on an email regarding the PS2 Group buy. But from there, I'm wondering which route I should go regarding the N55. Ideally, I want a consistent tuneable range of 450-550 whp, for track use and daily driving use. (Running BM3 soPS2 alone brings me to 430-440 ish range but feels a bit inconsistent as the bottle neck is still the fueling.PI is a good choice, but I don't know if there's any possibly faults that could arise, which is the only reason I'm kind of against doing it. Not only that, I don't know how much headroom it'll allow me to push our of the PS2. If it's anything like the TTFS HPFP then sure, maybe.The TTFS HPFP is available but it's sitting at a hefty 5k price tag (not including labor).Only doing this because I decided I'm gonna just make the most out of my N55 and defend it's honor. Plus, I grew attached to my M2.Thoughts?\n\nI'm in the same boat as you.  From what I've seen PI and meth will get you to 550ishI'm hoping these guys release their M2 version soon...http://www.xtreme-di.com/index_files/HPFP35.htmThat combined with PS2, e85 and Stage 2 LPFP should give some great results.\n\nHey seems you misunderstood what I told you earlier a little bit.PS2 for 430-440whp is very consistent because PS2 turbo is efficiently producing 16-17psi, intake air mass will be cool and back pressure will be little, allowing for high VE and great timing, meaning great room for adjustment to bad condition (ambient temp, humidity, altitude, octane), AKA power consistency.HPFP/PI can get you around 19psi on pump gas, or some extra 20-30whp. But power band wouldn't be pretty - peak at the middle and taper at top end -  very typical aftermarket tuning approach with a focus on peak rather than power holding. In the meanwhile, PS2 is running off efficiency zone and octane becomes restriction at upper rev range. Very popular sources of inconsistency.If you want \"consistent\" power at 450-500whp, PS2@20psi on meth is the only option. But the reliability is put on the line with meth. In addition you have to live with highly flammable material in the car and a strange looking water tank in the trunk. And extra controlling device, be it JB4 or AIC6.In the end, N55 isn't made for 450whp+ is all. Though you can push to have that or even much more than that no problem. But consistency and reliability are what you will not have.\n\n\n\nStrong fueling is like a luxury suite in a beautiful hotel. To get your girl high, you need hardness (boost) and skill (octane/timing) to use it. Your own things\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeat/CF Wheel/Bremble...OMG, you'd be paying 991.2 money for a outdated M2 LOL. I wouldn't btw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeanWRTWhat's the hangup on running something bigger than PS2? Running a larger turbo at a given pressure is going to net higher power, and if there's fueling for it with an better HPFP, then...I mean, PS2 is nice for bolt on and go (essentially), but 335 guys have been 'massaging' power above 600 for a little while now on the N55 with PI and larger turbo. What's stopping someone from running a BW EFR series and a port fueling setup? I haven't really looked into it that much because I'm never going that route, but curious as to what the hangup is? the M2 isn't THAT much mechanically different than a standard ewg N55\n\nYirunaHere 596Whp for you with the upgraded fuel system and PS2.\n\n\n\nIt was with mix 93 and E85 mix. We have another pump coming on the market but it is more intended for stock or PS1.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuning tech fuel system upgrade is the solution for high horse power M2's ,however, the price is high . I'm considering buy it but when I see the price I always take a step back .I wish they consider lowering the price . Btw my car currently running with PI , PS2 and all the supporting mods and it is amazing 😉.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "https://www.g-power.com/news-en/#news232Saw this recently and I thought it was interesting. Seems like G Power has an offering for us N55 owners. Slightly interested in doing their turbocharger upgrade but I haven't heard much of G-Power in the States.Anyone have any experience with them? From the states that is.\n\n\n\nG-Power is a reputable European tuner of BMW and Merc. Must remember their supercharger kit for E9X M3.M2 500ps PKG is their recent release. Basically a setup of FBO + turbo on pump gas. Apparently 500ps should be the crank number.I've been speaking with G-power for a while on this. But no concrete info on turbo I got back from them.It could be similar to TTE460 turbo, given the manufacture ratings.Using TTE460, a few months ago, another European tuner by the name of TPS Performance put together a similar PKG (except for adding a LPFP) they call M2 Stage 3 and got 473PS (466hp) on a dynojet, corrected to DIN (identical result to STD). See herehttps://www.facebook.com/tpsperforma...66989296824547TPS also stated they're co-developing a 500+ps turbo with TTE.TTE460 has revised compressor and turbine with a CNC bored housing, similar approach to PS2. It seems to make a little less power than PS2, and thus is more like a STG1.5 turbo.\n\n\n\nI'd say on pump gas, octane being a restriction, PS2 makes similar power to TTE460. When pushing boost up with more octane, different story though.TTE460 seems to have a less big turbine than PS2. Trade in a few power at higher boost for quicker spool. See attached dynograph where full boost (I bet 18~19psi) is achieved at 3k2rpm (WOT from 2k). It's quite impressive even if it was done on 5th gear.TTE460 is a good choice for pump gas build. I have a local TTE460 M2 friend, he's quicker than I am.Anyway, this thread is about G-Power, and it being a rebranded TT460 is only my guess. Don't quote me on that.\n\n\n\nDepends on how high boost target is, typically PS2 is 3k5-4k fully boosted on 1:1 gear pull. Meth and ethanol can help spool though.Spool up is physical, you can't tune to have that. When turbo spooled up, boost curve is all in the tune.\n\nI stand corrected.Good to know G-Power 500ps turbo is in-house engineered and built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The bmw technical guy did say no hp increase as the car will adjust to it so I believe that may be the case with most, not just that exhaust.The noise once it's bedded in is unreal, especially with the valves open. The drone was there until I done the ASD mod and now it's gone.It's worth the money for sure, and its cheaper than the Akra exhaust.Im happy with it and really glad I got it.\n\n\n\nI love mine, and with the Fabspeed catted down pipe it is the sickest, powerful sound.

I like the cars sound as it comes from the factory.  Its always nice to have the option to modify your car to meet your desires.  I suggest getting it stock and driving it for a couple of weeks before dropping the cash if your not entirely sure you want it.\n\nDo you really need it? Probably noBut it gives the car that extra cool factor especially if you combine it with all the CF bitsASD delete is a must though! Artificial engine sound does not belong with an aftermarket exhaust\n\n\n\nI would not do it if you are not ready to live with the drone. It sounds awesome but to be honest I am not sure I would buy it again. I daily drive it and the drone is too annoying to me. And I had to fix the cold start rattle by welding the clamp in.\n\nBest addition to this car. It is absolutely incredible.\n\nNot as much as hate my neighbors M4 with it.It sounds simply horrible.\n\nThe tips stick out too far, the tips aren't held securely at least on the first revision, and it requires a bluetooth device that eats a cupholder to actuate the valves.\n\nI'm looking at getting a Dinan S1, so I skipped on the MPE exhaust. Has anyone got any experience with both?\n\nmpe for m2 is the biggest cash grab in history. hell its not even lighter then the stock. its pathetic.

    "content": "Hi All-I have a FabSpeed catted downpipe on the way but I'm concerned about the increase in volume.  I live in a quiet (lots of older neighbors) neighborhood and I already feel bad enough with the stock set up leaving early in the AM.  I reached out toSaanena local-to-me member here and he offered to let me hear it at cold start up today.  He even let me drive it!  And fed me lunch!  With beer! Thanks againSaanen.  Let me just say: the M2 with his setup is anabsolute beast.I had downloaded an app called Decibel X and got a decibel reading on my stock rig.  And I ran it on Saanen's with FabSpeed Catted DP + DinanTronic Stage 1 tune (not sure if that impacts it or not) and got a decibel reading on the cold start (\"cold\" CA temp: ~55F).  I screwed up and didn't get the reading recorded--he may update the thread with a new run but I think it hit 125 decibels.  Mine maxed out at 108.Mine is below, and is currently stock.  I set up my iPhone 2' from the center of the rear bumper, slightly tilted up (I rested mine on my phone case, so the mic was 1/4\" higher than the other half).If you're willing, please download the \"Decibel X\" app, reproduce the test without your case blocking the mic, and post your results with a description of your setup including downpipe, charge pipe, cold air intake, resonator delete, stock or after market exhaust, tune (if any) and anything else relevant.  Start it without pressing the gas and let it run for 30+ seconds to see it drop to a normal idle.  It's too late for me, but anyone else looking for a quieter (or louder) config may appreciate the effort.  YouTube videos are great for tone, but it's hard to gauge the volume based on different recordings and PC setups.Here's me:CantComplain, stock exhaust and intake, no tune.  Bone stock. 108 decibels @ ~50 degrees Fahrenheit.oh and I already know I'm too old--if you like it loud and don't care about your neighbors, please don't crap on us who do.  We'd still like to see your numbers tho\n\n\n\nOn a cold start, if you increase the rpms to 12-1500, it will become VERY quiet. Hold it there for the cold start cycle. You will hear the difference so you know when you let off.\n\n\n\nI was a bit worried about this myself when my car arrived (Fabspeed DP and MPE here)...so I went to the neighbors I like and told them about/showed them the car and explained how it works and that I will try to keep it as quiet as I can.  The neighbors I don't like...can suck it.\n\nI'll measure the decibel level with the MPE and report back.\n\n\n\nCar is approved for sale in the states... f em\n\nCant wait to get my Fabspeed Sport Cat Downpipe installed. I plan on running it with the stock catback. Not really looking on getting any too loud, but like the idea of a performance gain with the Downpipe. I hope the sport cat just enhances the stock sound.\n\n\n\nHave your neighbors actually said something to you? Being woken up by a loud ass car every morning should bug that person enough to say something to you. I live in a town home and start up and leave every weekday around 7:30. The cold start in my garage with my catted dp is pretty loud, but i start moving out of the garage after 10 seconds or so and its not too much louder than a normal car as I'm driving out of the neighborhood. I have a neighbor who has complained to the HOA about me and other neighbors before. So I fully expected an email or complaint from them about my car but I've yet to get one. It's been half a year already with my dp.\n\nHere's with MPE - 120 decibel cold start on Sunday afternoon with temperature around 63FI don't even want to know what would happen if I add a downpipe - it's plenty loud for me, and my neighbors\n\n\n\nWill i loss warranty if replace my stock downpipe? I'm considering to get fabspeed sport cat too\n\n\n\nI took my M2 to work in Switzerland this morning as the roads were dry for once. Traffic is always moving at a crawling pace down the steepish 3 lane slope to the border. I put the car into Traction mode and travel in 1st gear, constantly letting my foot off the accelerator. The Fabspeed sport cat and muffler bypass take care of the rest ! Very loud and deeply satisfying gurgles for about a kilometer before switching into Comfort and innocent smile mode while coasting past the Swiss border guards so as not to get refused entry for excess noise.\n\nOK, OP here, updating my thread with my numbers after installing the Fabspeed catted downpipe.  These numbers should be a pretty good before vs. after for that particular mod.  This thread lived a hard life without a lot of love, but the gist is I was trying to get people to have an inventory for volume of the various exhaust configurations we have on our M2s.Unfortunately I didn't take my own advice and left the case on my phone--not sure if it will make a difference so I'll try again when cold and compare and update if so.Here's the bullet: CantComplain, stock exhaust and intakenow with Fabspeed sport cat downpipe, no tune.  Bone stock other than downpipe. 115 decibels @ ~50 degrees Fahrenheit.I have to say, I think it'll be higher without my iPhone 7 case on my iPhone 8.  I think some of the mic is blocked.  It's really loud at cold start.  But if this is correct, it's a 7db increase (108 to 115 peak vs. peak).  It feels a lot louder than that.\n\n\n\nDoes the fabspeed sportcat downpipe and m performance exhaust combo make the m2 significantly louder than just having the m performance exhaust? Does anyone have video of their fabspeed sportcat plus m performance exhaust?",

Both flashes went well but the fuel pump error popped up before I even took the car out of park... I tried using the bootmod3 app to clear the code multiple times, no luck. I then flashed back to the map I was running for the last year that had no issues... fuel pump code is still there, can't clear it. Second issue is with the DCT GTS flash, I like it in sport+ manual mode, but all of the automatic modes are shifting very very early. I decided to try and flash the DCT back to stock and I keep getting the error in the pic. What do I do? I've been out of the bootmod3 loop for a solid year.\n\nNot sure about the error when trying to flash back to stock but the fuel system error is usually fixed by using the \"Online Recode\" option on the map screen.\n\n\n\nThe DCT GTS basically has a single auto shift map: comfort.  It doesn't matter which drive mode you are in because that's the only shift map that it knows.  There's no solution for it. I posted this very same experience a month ago.  I flashed it back to normal DCT myself.\n\n\n\nFor the GTS flash back to stock I would put in a ticket but it should not be a problem. The fuel pump error is fixed by doing a on-line recode as stated in the bottom of the flash screen. That will fix the fuel pump error for good. Some ROM's get it and some don't. Mine did as well. I didn't do the GTS flash cuz I thought it sucked on the M4 and sure didn't want it on the M2*** The tune successfully flashed, but now I have a drivetrain malfunction/fuel error showing! ***If you have a successful flash, but get a drivetrain malfunction or fuel error, please utilize the Online Recode button on the map page (below the red flash button)****** Im getting (insert error here) and I cant find the answer! ***Please post/submit a ticket. If its OBD agent/flashing related, please take screenshots and be as detailed as possible. If its a drivability issue or anything else, please ensure you take datalogs with bootmod3 if possible and include them with your post along with details on the car, the map flashed, current modifications, and any other relevant information***\n\n\n\nLog it. Start with 3rd gear and from as low RPM as possible (1k~1k5rpm), pull to redline. Go up to 4th and 5th if possible.Clear up message box of yours and we can exchange info a little.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome on everybody lets all lighten up here. We have always lived thru all the brand mongers...and will always have to. From FSociety with BM3 and Brook1972 with HEX and others with JB4. Hell I was a supporter of the JB4 on the S55, it sucks on the M2. There will always be very vocal peeps so either way lets try and keep some of these threads information based to help the newbie's and whole community and not go reporting each other for finger pointing and name calling.None of the tune processes are without bumps in the road with all the BMW DME ROM's floating around out there. A few have a quirk here and there that they can work thru.Norcal,I suggest since you have chosen the BM3 platform, and a good one at that you start visiting this page to ask questions and post issues. It is a great group of users and tons of knowledge...https://www.facebook.com/groups/1995...4855695400876/So on that note, f**k all you guys while I go drive my BM3 flashed carAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\nButthurt @brooke, must be expressing his jealously on every bm3 postHe switches from mhd to hex every few weeks, has no informative post, don't waste your post replies on him.Typical user from his toon of choice, never dyno never 1/4 mile never Vbox/Dragy etc.",

I went into my dealership to test drive a m2 with MPE today, it did not have the cold start rattle, the exhaust had absolutely no burbles and crackles on downshift or when you slow down? Is that normal? i drove it on comfort, sport, sport plus, valves open! the exhaust note wasn't that loud like i expected either? all the video i was watching on youtube had much more crackles and burbles!!! even the stock exhaust was much louder? Was something wrong with the exhaust? everyone with MPE does it have more burbles and crackles then the stock exhaust? the dealer said it has to be broken in for 1000 miles?\n\nMaybe it has the new firmware update that people are saying eliminated all the burbles and crackles\n\nDid you push the valve controller button twice? That puts it in track mode with all the valves open; you will also notice a red light on the controller every few seconds.The difference is day and night with valves open and closes. With valves open, it's a straight pipe design that bypasses the muffler.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you see the valves open from the outside?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a 2018 with mpe still in break-in period and it absolutely crackles and burbles.

    "content": "I have M2 LCI manual LBB with 4k km on her. She's stock, but I wanted to check her on dyno just to see how \"healthy\" the engine is. To be honest I am more than disappointed. It's the first time I hear that stock engine in M car (not M engine off course) is low on power comparing with catalogue figures. We did 2 runs, 5th and 6th gear. See the dyno chart below.Now I started thinking about power upgrade. I heard some good opinions about racechip box.https://www.racechip.eu/shop/bmw/m2-...2kw-500nm.htmlWhat do you think?\n\nWhy are you disappointed? That is HP on wheels right?Then in my book it sounds right on track...As for tune I would have a look at bootmod3 or simular, and not go for a chip.\n\nThe guy on the dyno said it was the engine power not on wheels. Otherwise I wouldn't even complain about it here.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but unless he pulled your engine out and put it on an engine dyno it can't be \"engine power\"\n\nTorque looks good\n\nHas to be power at the wheels.  The figures look good.\n\n\n\nLol how on earth can he measure engine power from a dyno while the engine is in the car??!Be happy with those numbers.\n\nIn europe its common to measure the power at the crank by multiplying with a loss factor. Since the nm is right where it has to be i assume its upscaled to „at the crank\"\n\n4fatsnake - its common in UK/EU for dyno's to give at crank numbers - evolve's dyno's for their m2 posted on herehttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho...42&postcount=1~ 308 WHP~370 flywheel or CHPOP's car appears to be down on power but that might be due to a number of different factors.\n\nI'd ask about the tuning software. It may be out of date. From what I can tell Dynatech is on at least version 6, and that image shows version 3.5.9 possibly from 2004.https://vtechdyno.eu/software-for-ch...namometer.htmlAlso is odd that the name fabryka is on your image and also their website image. Leading me to believe you got the test done by directly them themselves. So, if true, why different software?",

    "content": "These are the mods I plan to do while under factory warranty.  I just wanted to share my results.Here is the baseline for my M2.JB+:The JB+ is as straight forward as it can get.  Unplug one sensor and install the JB+ in between the OEM plugs.  I just tie wrapped mine to keep it from vibrating.  I set mine at the 12 oclock position so its roughly a 3psi gain.I drove with this mod for a couple days before installing the DP and intercooler.  I am very happy with just this cheap upgrade.  Midrange power is noticeably increased.  Well worth it in my opinion.Wagner EVO2 Competition Intercooler:Installation was surprisingly difficult due to the OEM clamps/clips.  I fought with the clips for 30 minutes before giving up and just forcing it off.  I still have no idea what the trick to removing these are.  The fit and finish is great.Fabspeed 200 Cell Cat Downpipe:This was very easy to install.  The fit and finish is perfect.I didnt notice any real change in power once the intercooler and downpipe was installed.  The audible experience is great.  The turbo can be heard building boost clearly and the overall exhaust note is pleasing to the ear.Dyno Results:We made a run with the JB+ set to max but the M2 gave me a check engine light so I backed it down to the 12 oclock position.Final thoughts:Get the JB+ and set it at 12 oclock.  Its cheap and made a very noticeable gain.  The intercooler and downpipe makes the car sound awesome, but its really a modification to support future mods.FYI, I purchased everything from Mike at Extreme Power House.  Drop him a PM for quotes.  Great guy and easy to deal with.\n\nThe trick to the black plastic clips is to push on either end (the raised square parts) towards the intercooler.  You can do them one end at a time.  Pops right off after that.^  This is pretty much my configuration - I have the Dinan sport tuner set at the sport+ setting since I installed the Wagner Evo 1 intercooler, and I'm waiting (and waiting) for the sport cat downpipe.  Been running 94 octane since I got the sport tuner.Agreed the guys at X-PH are awesome.  I ordered the downpipe & sport tuner direct from their respective manufacturers and the intercooler from Extreme.  Quick shipping, great price, no hassles.\n\nCurious what the CEL was for at +4 psi?\n\n\n\n\n\nlove the +60 HP surge @5100No noticeable power increase from DP? That's a first.\n\nWere the IC and DP installed prior to the second set of dyno charts?  I can't tell for sure from your post.\n\nAwesome write up OP, im glad you like your new mods\n\n\n\n\n\nNice!!I have had the dinan sport tuner set to race mode, with a wagner comp 1 intercooler and the Fabspeed DP for 6k miles now. Never a CEL and it feels like a factory setup.Its a perfect setup and plenty quick. Midrange power is amazing which makes it even better for street duty.\n\n\n\nWhat exactly was the code you got with +4psi?\n\n\n\nWould the JB+ on max cause a CEL without the mods?\n\n\n\n\n\nSeems like whatever the JB+ maxxed out is no good for these engines. Whereby multiple people have had the dinan product in race mode without issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn stock, get your orders in before we run out again",

    "content": "So I know that this has been covered before and I have read the posts, but I have been getting them.  It typically happens at about 120mph in, I think in 4th gear. It has already been to the dealer, they say that when they scan the car they can see the malfunction registered but they don't know why.  I told them about what I read on the fourms about software updates and even showed him the posts but he had no real answers for me , except this.....  I have the exhaust valve bypass installed and they told me that they have seen this cause the problem before and I should take it out.  The main problem is that the problem is not easily repeatable.  Meaning I can not get it to do it specifically.  Sometimes it happens and sometimes it won't.  I will take it out but I cant see how this can cause a drivetrain malfunction.  The only other mods are the FabSpeed HFC and Dinan resonator delete.  Nothing to the computer.  Any help would be great.\n\nNo tune ? I've only seen DTMAL with bad gas or bad tune\n\nI don't know either.  I don't think that is was bad gas as the car was running fine otherwise. It is so frustrating because I don't know when and if this will continue to happen.  I love pushing the car but now I always have this in the back of my mind.\n\n\n\nA HFC could certainly cause the car to think that something is wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a thought. Could it be fuel starvation?  There's been a number of reports of fuel pump issues at the track with less than 1/4 tank at high rpm.\n\n\n\nEasy solution by the looks of it! Your HFC might be causing the issue here.Ask the dealer to do PUMA 62732575-01, after that retry if you have the issue.Same thing happened to my car, the drivetrain needed to be re-calibrated and adjusted to your new set up.MR\n\n\n\nSo I haven't gone to the dealership again, but the light came on again yesterday.  I was in 4th gear and accelerated (mildly) form 80 to 100 and BOOM!  I had half a tank of gas and the temp was 74 deg.  This is getting very frustrating. I have the info that MR. gave me but I am waiting to hit the 1200 mile mark to have my rear dif oil changed since I had the recall done.  Hopefully that will fix this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry some of that is cut off.  What was your issue and fix?

    "content": "Like some others before me, when I got my 2016 M2 I dreamed of making it into an M2 GTS.  I wanted something street legal but that was very focused for heavy track duty.  I also didn't want a build that looked like an aftermarket parts bin exploded on the car...so I focused on making it look as OEM as possible.You can see extensive write ups, parts list, and pictures on my motor club website located herehttps://www.siliconvalleymotorclub.com/m2-build/but I will do some lighter updates to this thread.I am about half way done with the build so be on the lookout for updates soon.  For now here is where I am in the project.What's been done:- lots of M performance cosmetic parts- coding to switch to Euro MDM, and knock out some error codes when the front seats were removed- Apex wheels and Nitto NT01 tires (275 square set up)- Dinan intake and tune and resonator delete- KW clubsport suspension and adjustable camber platesWhat's in progress:- Sparta Evolution BBK- M performance racing steering wheel with electronic display- Cobra Imola seats (reupholstered in OEM leather, Alcantara, and Polar Blue stitching)- custom half cage powder coated white and rear seat delete panels also upholstered to match OEM interior- fire suppression system and electrical cut off fabricated into center consoleStill in planning stage:- carbon fiber adjustable splitter- carbon fiber adjustable racing wing- carbon fiber canards and side skirtsI will post pictures soon but also check this website for more detailshttps://www.siliconvalleymotorclub.com/m2-build/\n\nFirst thing to do, remove Dinan box.You want to track you need full data access. With Dinan, your boost, AFR, timing and even IAT reading are incorrect - I verified that statement in 2016.On stock turbo, you need a very customized tune that runs a little less boost than all the OTS currently in the market. Try get power from upper rev range with timing advance. Focus on AFR to keep EGT in check and that improve timing as well. HPFP/LPFP is not remotely your problem.TBH, hardware wise. Seat & wheel for lightweight, brake and tire for grip, Clubsport damper for cornering, and intercooler/dp/inlet/tune for power. Above those, you'll have very diminished return as you spend to push.\n\nThanks SeanWRT for your thoughts.  I will have to play around with the tune and engine mods as you suggested to find the right balance given my goals.On your other ideas I totally agree.  Some of this I have done and other things I am in the process of doing.  I have moved to a lighter and wider tire and wheel set up but will tweak further as I get more track time in and find the weaknesses.  Brakes are the weakest part of all BMW's so by going to a Sparta BBK with 6 in the front and 4 in the back with track specific pads and slightly larger rotors should all help.  I also will likely need front brake air intakes to reduce heat (need to test and tune that assumption).  Intercooler is something I want to look into after I get everything else done first so that I can isolate the impact of the changes as I do them.  Your comment on spend to push is 100% on point, yet I am also looking to achieve a vision (sometimes void of logic) but your point is taken.Thanks again for the feedback.\n\nWhat time are you running at Laguna with this setup?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Wanted to discuss results and improvements on aftermarket FMIC'sFor those that log and have upgraded intercoolers what kind of temp rises do you see. I am curious of real world driving resultsI am running a stepped drop inWith outside temps of 50-53 deg I am seeing 22-25deg rise on a 2k-6k 5th gear pull and very close the same on a 3-4-5 gear pull from 2.3k to 6k shifting at 5.9k each timeBoosting between 14-17psiPulls were back to backsingle pull was from 61 to 84 deg3 gear pull was from 79 to 104 degOn the stock cooler I would see a 30-33 deg rise on a single 4th gear pull with outside temps at 42-47 deg (winter)\n\nI'm using Wagner Evo Comp 2 FMIC and I logged my last track day.Laps 1-2.Laps 3-4.With outside temp of 17-18C I experienced 14-20C temp differences.The pulls were in 3-4 gears between 2,5k-6,5k due to the characteristic of the track.My max MAP values were around 195-198 KPa with 98-99 KPa atmospheric pressure. So if I calculate it well it's around 1 bar boost, which is 14 psi.\n\nI have the Wagner EVO II Performance on my FBO M2. My IATs drop as I start a 3rd gear 2k-redline pull, then it holds, then it increases a few degrees. All of my logs always decrease quite a bit. Its pretty good I think!

I just upgraded to the CSF intercooler and want to redo those 60-130 pulls to see if my real world times will decrease.\n\nThere's a few testers in the F30 section from grabbing a bunch of logs and test so far i can rate them like this1- CSF2- Dinan3- CTS Turbo/Wagner/VRSF/ER were same *slight edge on CTS*4- Phoenix (Worse almost not worth it over stock for back to back pulls)Now the BIGGER Upgraded ones for Turbo cars I don't have enough logs from users to really suggest anything yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy OE weighed 7.2 on a shipping scale, the VRSF 17.4. I have not observed the delta between ambient temps and normal driving just was logging actual WOT pulls to make the cooler work. Also I had noticed a little bit of a delay upon application of WOT but I recall it was not that great and I have gotten used to it if it even still exists since these adapt quickly. The claim is 87% larger than OE but not sure how much of that volume actually is heat exchanged and how much is pass thru\n\nSo last night I received theATM ICI purchased, and pulled the CSF and OE ICs out of their boxes to compare.Not surprisingly (look at the mfg pics), the CSF shares the exact same dimensions and angles as the ATM. I state it in that order because the ATM IC has been out for much longer than the CSF. There are a few small differences though. The CSF is 1.8lbs heavier (24lbs ATM, 25.8lbs CSF). I don't know where that weight is coming from as both cores have the same FPI. Could the end tanks be made of different material even though they're shaped the same? Another small difference I noticed is that the bars inside the end tanks have flat faces in the CSF, and they're rounded in the ATM, like on the front side of both ICs (and both MFGs claim this improves airflow into the fins). Additionally, the finishing on the ATM seems a bit better. The inlet/outlets are smoother on the inside, but the roughness inside the end tanks of both is the same.I can also clarify my earlier statement of the distance between the inlet/outlets on the Wagner and CSF/ATM ICs. The Wagner's inlet/outlets are closer together than the CSF/ATM IC, and comparing the OE IC to the CSF/ATM, the inlet/outlet spacing is identical. So it turns out the Wagner is narrower than reference/OE.Since the dimensions and FPI of the CSF match the ATM, I expect the performance is likely the same too.\n\nWhich one will you install? The ATM?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that Dinan intercooler (and also intake/ exhaust syste) requires cutting of actual steel parts of the vehicle that I would worry to make impact on vehicle rigidity.Regardless of the functional factor of how FMIC works the best, Dinan is way off the list from my perspective as they must cut and remove \"A LOT\" of parts...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The M2 manifold design dictates a true single pipe configuration system with it being 2 into 1 unlike the M3/4 which is a true 2 pipe system. Im considering changing the exhaust system but considering retaining the single pipe configuration. Does anyone have an aftermarket single bore cat back exhaust rather than the twin configuration like the Remus\n\nOur system uses a true single design, utilizing 3.5\" mandrel bent stainless tubing from the turbo back. The stock downpipe and all of the aftermarket options shrink down to just under 3\" before connecting to the exhaust system. Our system maintains the 3.5\" diameter from the turbo back to the tips.The benefit of a single design is to promote exhaust velocity. We've found that it makes more power and helps turbo spool compared to the dual pipe systems. Even our M3/M4 system is a single 3.5\" design and it's proven to be the most effective system on the market.https://store.activeautowerke.com/pr...exhaust-system\n\n",

Most likely will go with BM3, seems to be getting good reviews from the guys likeSeanWRTtehboostm2ruderthat seem to know a lot about this stuff (definitely not me!).Have:- MPE (installed)- FS SC DP (installed)- Wagner EVO II FMIC (not installed)- Eventuri Intake (not installed)- FTP Motorsport Charge & Boost Pipes (not installed)Need:- Turbo Inlet Pipe-other??Where can I get the inlet pipe?What brand are most of you using?Am I missing anything else that is needed to \"safely\" run the BM3 Stage 2 tune?Also, I have just received the AWRON gauge...I didn't think to check if there are any issues running this gauge simultaneously with the BM3 tune??  I did read that you can't run AWRON and JB4 at the same time as they both use the CANBUS or something so they \"fight\" with each other.  Does anyone know if there are any similar issues with AWRON and BM3 running simultaneously?Any insights/constructive comments are appreciated.\n\nThe Turbo Inlet Pipe is only needed if you upgrade the turbo to be honest!I have not seen any proven data that the stock is restrictive with the stock M2 turbo yet.Darkiedm4is a PURE Dealer and can get you with that Inlet.You're bolt-ons part are all lined up to go with BM3 STG2No issues with AWRON just needs to needs to be disabled or unplugged when you first flash so it doesn't get any OBD/CANBUS power. There's a few guys running their AWRON with Gauge so no issuesBM3 is a flash so it does not live on the canbus, now if you want to do data-logging I am pretty sure the AWRON has a setting where it will see the OBD2 Cable plugged and allow the Bm3 to take over.abirmaheris a good friend of mine had a FBO M235 with BM3 now got an FBO M2 with Bm3 as well\n\nLooks like you should be good to go with those mods. The real requirement for stage 2 is downpipe, though I would install the FMIC asap. Any other questions feel free to ask but I'm very happy with bootmod3 on my M2 and loved it on my M235 especially after switching over from JB4. You won't be disappointed.\n\n\n\nIs changing the exhaust absolutely mandatory for stage 2? Is the stock exhaust really that limiting?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just got the bm3 stg2 93oct ots map on my m2 last weekend I only have a catted dp iat seems normal so far except after a couple runs of course it goes up because of the stock ic it still cool here so I think I can get away with it until ambient temps start rising although I do plan on getting an ic and charge piping soon. I must say switching over from the jb4 the car feels much better also no issues with fuel pressure so far. I  have yet to get some good logs to make sure all is good but the car feels smooth and more powerful than ever.\n\nI am running stg 2 93 and do not have a aftermarket DP. Per PTF I should be ok as long as i am not tracking the car. i do have an upgraded FMIC and the MPE\n\nNo need for the turbo inlet, you mods are good.I can help you get BM3\n\nTurbo inlet doesn't hurt to add! Only PURE makes them, install is a PITA! But cheap. Prob lowers duty cycle a little with stock turbo, I have it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupposed to be 94 octane, but who knows...these oil companies are probably full of BS.\n\n\n\nIs the FMIC really necessary if you aren't tracking the car in hot climates?\n\n\n\n",

What gives the boost in power?\n\nActually, I believe it has been determined that the M2 does NOT have a closed block design.  There are long threads on this subject somewhere on this site.  It was quite the discussion for several months...\n\n\n\nMy understanding is that stock boost is about 15-16 psi...Lots of us are doing one thing or another about that, however\n\nI think the turbofold is different as well.\n\n\n\nM2 doesnt have a closed deck. Just the crank is different. I saw one when it was getting built.

The less restrictive turbofold on the M2 allows this.  Also look at the various M2 PS2 results, they on the whole hit similar numbers as the other ewg cars but at less boost, again pointing towards the less restrictive turbofold.You also need to ask why companies and tuners would go to the trouble of having M2 specific turbo upgrades and maps if everything really was all equal?\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll post up a M2 engine difference summary thread when I have time.Spoiler- the assumption of it being merely a tuned up EWG is very wrong. At 450-550whp range, M2 puts down 30-50whp more than the next best N55 variant, given everything else equal.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,Ive been researching Actives signature turbo-back exhaust but theres a real lack of user reviews or videos online, from what I can see.Has anyone here had it installed? Heres the product listing:https://store.activeautowerke.com/co...exhaust-systemI know its a full exhaust system but $3450 is a lot of cash. Though you seem to get a lot more for the money VS the other option Im looking at (MPE).One thing I also cant figure out is if this turbo-back system actually includes a downpipe... by the looks of the product description, this is purchased separately..but the images show a DP in them.Any views appreciated!\n\nHey there, i was dealing with the same issue while contemplating getting this exhaust. I can't be happier with it. It sounds absolutely ridiculous and trust me when i tell you that nothing i've heard comes close. It burbles and it pops loudly on upshifts. But not obtrusive at all in the cabin. It comes with downpipe and all the parts necessary for instal. It's not a cheap unit but it is a very high quality. Design and function go hand in hand with their products. One important thing to acknowledge that you pay for the exhaust itself, where some others charge just $1k for fancy tips alone. It will be loud on cold starts and you will get a check engine unless you use a spacer so plan on getting a tune.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImo, fi make the best sounding M2 exhaust, and I've heard a lot on person, but not the AA on an M2.Honestly, valve closed the Fi Ehaust is quieter than stock in cabin, slightly louder behind the tailpipes and with it open, it's just insane!\n\n\n\n+1 FI with Fabspeed catted DP. I drive with valves open 99% of the time. The thing burbles on lift in 6th gear lol\n\nFi for the M2, truly make an astounding system, through tunnels WOT It almost sounds like an F1 Car, it burbles and pops so loud people think your shooting a shotty.And the best thing is, you can pretty much turn it right off, and drive normally like nothing happened! To my surprise, valve closed outside cabin still burbles and is louder than stock especially if you climb revs to over 5k..However, if you keep it under 3k, it genuinely sounds quieter than stock.The exhaust is honestly intoxicating. and Anyone that makes this purchase, will definitely not dissapoint!I was at a car show, there were a few other M2s/M6s/M3s/M4s..All came to look at my exhaust, they thought it was akra (I got carbon tips) and it looks identical.. and they were like holy shit!!!\n\nSince our exhaust uses the OEM valve, any of the aftermarket valve controllers will work just fine. We have an Awron gauge in our car that has the flap control, and we have a few customers using the CG Precision wireless controller with the key fob as well.The main benefit of using our system with our included downpipe is the fact that the system never shrinks below 3.5\". Most other systems are made to work with an OEM style downpipe that shrinks to under 3\" at the flange. We maintain a full 3.5\" to the tips in both configurations (valve open or closed) so even with the valve closed you still have 100% of the performance gain. We don't force exhaust gases through any smaller piping when the valve is closed.To answer your original post, our exhaust includes a full 3.5\" downpipe. If you already have a different downpipe or wish to keep your OEM downpipe we can include an adapter to fit those options as well.\n\nit sounds convincing on video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+1 for Active Autowerke exhaust\n\n\n\nAny update on the catted version and how do we get this to the Uk?Its a shame the Fi exhaust doesnt pass the EU tests as I wouldnt mind one of them\n\n\n\nThat is my wife!As someone mentioned earlier, it does sound very exotic. To be honest sounds better than my friends Huracan(My opinion and Huracan owner also) I have the same exhaust on my M4 and as good as it sounds it is far from the music the M2 makes. We have Awron to control flap and flash tune that eliminated cold start. It is a fantastic package\n\n",

What I can't seem to find are the differences in power delivery and noticeable turbo lag.I'm curious how much longer the stage 2 takes to spool and how that affects driveability and feeling in the lower rpm range?I've been looking at what others have done and at different dyno charts, and I know they can't be compared apples-to-apples between different cars with different mods, ECU tunes, etc., however it's all I have to go by without access to a stage 2 car for seat of the pants comparison.I'm currently running an MPE with Bootmod3 stage 1 and am about to bolt on a Fabspeed 200CEL sport cat and Wagner EVO2 Competition intercooler and flash to BM3 stage 2.  I'm trying to decide which turbo direction to go and what fuel issues will come into play.  I have access to Sunoco 100 octane race fuel locally.Thoughts?SeanWRT isrunning a Dinan stage 1 turbo:Norcalmav23 isrunning a Pure stage 2 turbothat appears to develop power without any noteable delay compared to SeanWRT's stage 1:\n\nGreat thread.I know we can’t compare different dyno sheets, but it’s important to note that the power and torque axes are flipped between these two sheets.Also, it’s interesting that the numbers in the stage two sheet are a decent bit lower than Sean’s. Again, can’t directly compare, but I wouldn’t expect this.\n\nThat second graph looks like a stock M2.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplicated. Edit.\n\nTry to know spool up from dyno graph, you need to take below into consideration, each one of them makes SIGNIFICANT difference. So comparing dyno plot, you better do it same day same person who knows what he is doing.1) Gear - higher gear looks faster spool because rpm climbs slower so turbo has time to spin up. Particularly in our platform, there is roughly 300-400rpm difference in spool up between 4th and 5th gear.2) When to apply WOT - which basically is when boost starts to build up.3) Target Boost - higher target takes longer time or higher rpm to reach.4) Fuel - Ethanol and Methanol greatly helps spool. This point fails to be mentioned, but it's very basic physical/chemical and makes significant difference.5) Ambient - namely altitude, thinner air makes it harder to boost up.BTW, with my dyno runs, WOT was applied at 1500rpm@5th gear.",

They changed the shapeThanks for the pic Dirtboy\n\nI've been looking into reverse engineering the bluetooth controller signals and seeing if theres a way to build an app to activate this.\n\nThe Macht Schnell EVC Module integrates it to the turn signal, it also removes the check engine light for catless DP.https://ind-distribution.com/product?sku=40.00.100\n\nI noticed in the video for the Macht Schnell EVC Module that each time you press the BC button, it is also changing the data shown in the cluster display (the factory purpose for this button).  I like to have my fuel/100km info displayed at all times.  Seems like if I am having to press this button to also actuate the exhaust flap and this is simply open or closed, it would be difficult/annoying to determine the correct number of button presses so that the exhaust flap will be open AND the desired data is displayed on the cluster.  Otherwise it's an interesting solution.As for the cigarette lighter mod, I would not like to lose the charge port functionality. However, this did give me an idea...I'm wondering if anyone has tried using the \"blanks\" under the headlight switch?  I believe in Europe these buttons are used for the rear fog lights and presumably the front fogs in a regular 2 series.  Seems that provided there is enough room behind the button to house the blue tooth control unit, it would simply require a hole to be dremmeled out matching the size of the control unit.One additional question...I assume the MPE control unit uses batteries?  Has anyone had to replace theirs yet?  If so, what type of battery and is it easy to replace?\n\ni just have mine sitting in the armrest compartment, car sounds perfect with the sport cat, i only put it in track mode occasionally for shits and giggles\n\nI just wish I could leave the valves open permanently.Otherwise, I have it placed in the cupholder: fits perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI plan on leaving them closed till I leave the neighborhood then opening them up. And on highway traveling drives maybe leave it closed....other than than well\n\n\n\n\n\nWon't work with the MPE...it is a stand alone BT system completely separate from the car system\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comBMW M2 SEMA Build ThreadI took delivery of my M2 almost one year ago, back in April of 2016.  It was one of the first cars in the country, and I have enjoyed the heck out of it for 20,000 miles over the last 10 months.  It has served me well on track and on street, but the time has come to make it more of a track-focused car.Last year, I took the plunge and signed up for an event I have wanted to do for a long time - One Lap of America.  We built a car that received a lot of attention: a Pure Turbo/JRZ/Stoptech/Wavetrac BMW X1 35i that ran a high 11 1/4 mile and could lap Mid-Ohio in the low 1:40s.  Sadly, just two months before the event the car was totaled on the street.After that car was wrecked and a nightmare of arguing with insurance over the value of parts (good luck proving the replacement value of a custom $5k aftermarket suspension), I purchased the M2 and swore off modding.  That lasted about a week, which brings me to the goal of the current build.  Simply put, I plan on building a car that can handle repeated track abuse while being economically reasonable to run, and will be displayed in my company's SEMA booth this year.  I think the M2 is the perfect platform for this, and I am very excited to get started.Table of Contents (will be updated with direct links to each future post)1.  Brakes (Essex AP Racing CP9668 endurance kit)2.Tearing Down the Cooling system\n\nBrakes:  Stock Limitations and the Solution, Essex AP Racing CP9668Disclaimer - I am a hardware and product design geek with a particular interest in brakes.  When I'm at parties and people start playing \"Would you rather,\" usually they ask about Scarlet Johansson vs. Mila Kunis.  I counter with \"DTM brakes vs. Indycar brakes?\"  People usually just stare blankly for some reason.  Consider yourself warned!I have occasionally been accused of being hard on brakes.  With the old X1, I will admit I took some offense to this criticism - it was a 4000lb car with 430whp and undersized discs.  How was it possible to not be hard on them?  OEM brakes with upgraded pads and fluid were essentially pointless.  But when even a Stoptech kit wore out and failed on track (non-catastrophically, just needed a premature rebuild) I realized that I probably was, unfortunately, \"he who massacres brakes.\"The M2's stock braking system is markedly better (obviously) than the X1's was.  It consists of a four piston Brembo caliper up front, and a two-piston caliper in the back.  The rotors are fairly massive; 380mm up front and 370mm in the rear.  I initially began tracking the car with the combo that everyone recommends - the Pagid RS29 and Castrol SRF fluid.  I found that this combo works fairly well at anything under 8/10ths, but once you really start to push the car they fade and fade fast.There are a few issues with the stock braking system that led me to realize I was going to have to replace it (especially given my reputation for braking brutality).1.  Extremely limited pad selection.  Performance Friction refuses to get their act together and make their better compounds like PFC08 and PFC01 for this caliper.  Pagids were pretty much the only choice in town for top level performance, which leads me to my next point....2.  I realize I am in the minority here, but I am not thrilled with the RS29 performance or feel.  I found them to have dangerous levels of fade during the latter half of an aggressive 30 minute session.  The pedal feel is spongy once they overheat and it never returns.  This is not an issue with air in the lines or boiled fluid - I run SRF and bled them many times.  I feel like the composition of the pad itself changes behavior once it is heated past a certain point.  There are reports over on Rennlist of similar issues.3.  Inefficient pad shape.  Low overall mass, low surface area, very thin = high heat, high rate of wear, and high running costs.4.  Poor performing and unnecessarily heavy rotors.  Drilled rotors will crack fairly quickly and 380 rotors are overkill size wise considering the low density of cooling vanes.  These giant rotors are unfortunately little more than marketing gimmicks to get people to talk about the \"big brakes\" the M series cars have.  I view them as unnecessary unsprung weight.5.  No anti-knockback springs.  As cars accumulate track use and especially as wheel bearings start to go, knockback becomes a factor.  While I try to remember to check my brakes before each high speed braking zone with a light left foot brush, I still like knowing that my pedal will respond exactly as expected each time with no surprises.6.  Dust boots that vaporize after 10 minutes on track, causing a mess and becoming useless on the street.7.  Color shift - these pretty blue calipers will become an ugly aquamarine green after taking on significant heat.Destroyed Dust Boots of Stock CaliperDifference in Cooling Vanes with the AP Racing J-hook Rotor vs. Stock M2 RotorThese considerations led me to review the various options on the market from Brembo, Stoptech, and AP Racing.  Fairly quickly one kit jumped out at me as being aimed at a different target demographic than the others.  Stoptech and Brembo kits are beautiful for sure, but when I compared features that mattered to me the AP Racing kit provided by Essex Parts quickly skyrocketed up my \"brake lust\" list.  Yes, I have a \"brake lust\" list.The particular kit I chose was the Essex AP Racing CP9668 kit:https://www.essexparts.com/essex-des...-f87m2f80m3f82The reason I chose this kit is fairly simple - it's the only pre-assembled kit on the market that uses motorsport parts.  Look up the CP9668 caliper on AP Racing's website and it's listed squarely under racing applications.  In comparison, Stoptech or Brembo kits (even the Stoptech trophy) are based on street calipers and have street caliper features (heavier, aluminum pistons instead of steel, dust boots, etc).  The AP Racing kit has the following benefits which are unique to this kit and platform:1.  Stiffest caliper available in a kit for the M22.  Massive 25mm thick pads - about twice as thick as a stock M2 pad3.  Superior cooling design in the caliper with heat-resistant stainless steel pistons4.  Anti-knockback springs5.  Saves 8lbs of unsprung weight6.  Uses J-hook rotors with 84 cooling vanes - lighter and higher performing than stock7.  Anodized finish will not color shift8.  Support from Essex.  I have had poor support from Stoptech in the past, whereas Jeff from Essex has actually answered emails from me within minutes on the weekend.  That is priceless when you are on-track and something goes wrong.One of These is Not Like the OtherI had the opportunity to visit the Performance Racing Industry show this year, so before purchasing I was able to put hands and eyes on this kit, the Brembo kits, and the Stoptech kits all in one day.  When the kit was delivered to my house, I was just as impressed as when I first saw them.  These calipers are an absolute work of industrial art, and I get an immense amount of satisfaction not just in their performance, but in knowing how well designed they are.  Further than that, every single piece of hardware included is top notch.  The bolts and washers are grade 10.9, the caliper bracket is machined perfectly, and the anodized finish is among the nicest I have ever seen.  It just oozes professional quality.How Big is Your....Caliper?For pads, I opted to go with the Ferodo Racing DSUNO on the advice of Jeff from Essex.  I have never used these before, but after explaining my preferences in a pad he felt they would be a good fit.  These are 25mm thick so I am expecting to get quite a few events out of each set.

Shorter pedal travel, better feel (more resistance), lower resting height.  Worth it IMO\n\n\n\n\n\nSome impressions from several folks here:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho...h+pedal&page=1\n\nI have it.  It is a worthy upgrade.It does what it says it does: lower the clutch pedal (nothing more, nothing less).  If you use/like the BMS clutchstop, this is a more complete modification (both are good, obviously the price point is a lot different).  I have both.I chose the middle setting (sport), and the feel is still very much like stock.  I'm curious to see what the race setting feels like, as I still would prefer to feel the clutch bite (it is still hard to feel it since the clutch is smooth; but the pedal travel is so short, its a non-issue).Because you have to get under the car to install it, it is almost a must to lift the car - and so I took it to a shop to install (I couldn't DIY it).I bought the M2 for its handles and feel and this mod does well to improve the drive experience.\n\nI never went under the car installing mine, everything’s between the dash & floor.  Still needed to do some contorting.I tried the race setting, but the feel was weird; it was firmer, which was good, but about half way down it would just drop to the floor (which was bad).  I changed to sport setting, which feels perfect.\n\n\n\nThe UCP on the sport setting is noticeably different from stock, for me.  Maybe an increase in pedal resistance of about 25-30%--enough to make it feel like you are pushing against a spring...instead of stock, which feels to me like pushing through water.  Still not stiff by any means, but a change for the better.Combine it with an SSK, and happiness is...\n\n\n\n",

The gains with a 400 cell DP will be less than that of the 200 or 300 cell. OEM is 600 Cell (400 + 200 secondary), so be more restrictive than the rest of the market, but should flow more than stock.If you're worried about CEL with the DP, know that currently the only near 100% success rate is with Fabspeed. Wagner so far has also had very high success rates, and just from anecdotal evidence on the forums it probably holds the 2nd place on the podium for preventing CEL. Take that for what it's worth.\n\nfrom what ive seen only fabspeed guarantees no cel, if you are avoiding fabspeed i thing wagner 200 cell is probably the best bet, although this triggers a cel in a small percentage of users but from what ive read their quality is good\n\nWagner is a great option, they are using Euro 6 cats.Chances of getting a CEL with these new cats is close to none.We are getting 5 Fabspeed DP sent to us next week if you change your mind.",

    "content": "To help others with questions concerning the MPE here is my updateNow after having the MPE since Dec (3 mths & 2800 mi) and doing a hard hi speed mountain road runs here are my current comments.Note: I have V2 with the exit pipe braces and slip over attaching interface.The exhaust is awesome..... the way a BMW track car should sound. Not too loud and obnoxious....just rightCost for me was reasonable since I didn't have to purchase tips. I purchased the exhaust from Sun Motorcars and had tips from previous F82I run it in either sport with flaps open or comfort with flaps closed, why?*Cuz when you run flaps open and in comfort for some reason there is more resonating thru the car at below 3500 rpm then there is with flaps open. Why, i have no friggin idea. You would think it is the other way around.My car has the most pops/burbles in flaps open & sport, way more then in MDM & flaps open contrary what others are saying.The fit was perfect the first time, install straight forwardThe exhaust makes a little bit of HP proven with my dyno results 3-7hp aproxThe water drain hole in the bottom leaves a black trail up the back of the polished can FYIMine still has awful cold start vibration, but am used to it after having the F82 & MPEMy bluetooth connection has been working fine so far and has not dropped. I did do the install myself so know how it was put togetherFeel free to ask any questions\n\n\n\nOk so an update to my update....So as you know I have the resonating cold start noise. I started playing around with some things to try and lesson the cold start resonation. I tried pulling the exhaust back a bit to load the rubber hangers differently and left it over night to get a true cold start. Still the same, but I moved it back too far and upon full temp and exhaust expansion it touched heat shielding. Then I tried moving it far as possible forward...still the same on full cold start. So it is not caused by design of the hanging points and as you know the exhaust also has a flex joint after the down piped so that should also help dampen any vibration.Well I remember someone commenting awhile back somewhere on here or the M4 forum about taking the tips off and trying it, I have the carbon-Ti tips. Well I took them off and it still vibrates but without the rattle resonating noise. It is a quiet vibration. So all this time with the F82 MPE and now the F87 MPE ( I have the same tips) the exhausts have always vibrated but the noise..... is being created with my M carbon titanium tips.Interesting..... I still love it\n\nSo here's your answer for the drone at 3K RPM in comfort but not sport.In sport/sport+ modes the DME asks the EWG ( electronic wastegate ) to be closed, or at 99.99% Duty cycle until it needs to vent boost, this is for quicker spool times, vs when in comfort it's open until X amount of throttle input.When the EWG is closed it means less exhaust flow through the pipes as it's being absorbed by the turbine wheels, thus producing what we like to call BOOOOOOOOOOST. That's why it's quieter\n\nThanks for the updates on your MPE. I've had my M2 for just under a week and am still undecided, but starting to lean toward this exhaust again.\n\nedit, didn't notice you already tried cold start with tips removed\n\n@m2ruderdoes yours feel louder after 2800 miles? I put around 4000 and it feels like it has gotten louder. Also, the dealership kinda fixed the rattle issue by pushing the exhaust in by about 3 inches. The cold rattle is now gone, with the only downside being that the exhaust tips sit about 0.5 inches behind the diffuser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have an aftermarket DP?  I have a Fabspeed Sportcat...and the Drone Zone (2800-3200) is horrible...in any mode to be honest but is worst when in traction mode with flaps open...which is sad since this is the combo that often has bystanders diving behind bushes, lol\n\nThis bracket?\n\nNope no DP...and as for the traction mode (MDM) it is not louder on my car. Sport is louder and has more crackles on mine with the MPE then MDM.MDM mode might give you more on the stocker but not mine with the MPE\n\n\n\n\n\nMy tips are pretty old, they were on the M4 for 20k miles before coming over to the M2\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I feel bad to waste Dzenan's time but I fixed it!That problem aside, which has nothing to do with PTF/BM3...this process is so easy even this tech stupid guy can do it. Once i got in 5min to do the unlock and initial flash and then 1 min to do the refresh to fix the fuel system error.I will be driving it to work in the morning to give it a test drive and see how it feels then I will read for trouble codes.

Sorry if I couldnt help you much.Hey SeanWRT, it appears that I almost max out that gauge...so Im not sure what the point is to the increase lol. Even when stock, the gauge serves no purpose IMO, but to me the numbers just increased but the needle goes to the same spot lmfao I want mine back to 400/400.\n\nIt's best when gauge is at the state of 'almost max out'. You know how hard DME think it's pushing. Unlike piggyback, DME see and process real inputs. So it serves well as a 'hard working' indicator.I have 400/400 gauge unchanged. I max it out easily and quickly from like just a tad above 4k rpm. I think 500/500 suits me better.

Looking forward to your impressions!\n\nCongrats\n\n\n\nBut how accurate are these gauges.... like maybe +10/20-0 hp? I mean I did a WOT pull from redline to 5500 in 4th and i swear it was at 420\n\nOk guys, I am jumping in on this and giving some feedback after two days of running the stg 2 93oct M2 tune. Now granted adaption is not complete and my past experience has been pretty extensive experimentation with the JB4 running 93, E30 & booster.I have been hot rodding around town a bit and did a couple of solid 4th gear pulls this morning and here is my 1st impression. Very consistent, solid yet smooth power curve and feels strong all the way up with some flutter up top. Now on the butt dyno it seems to need a bit to get going but remember now I am used to the boost being agro in your face (JB4) right out of the shoot so it kind of fools you into feeling like the map is a little soft but I am sure across the full range is makes up time real fucking quick.The JB4 was erratic, surges, flutters, hard to manage boost application via pedal....fucking disaster for a real driving car. Could prolly be fine for just pulls but feels like shit. The stg 2 93 flushes all that down the toilet. It feels completely mated to the car, power delivery is natural, smooth and predictable. I am happy so far...... Also note I am running aprox 96oct so am going to drop it down a bit and see how it fairs and see if the HPFP holds upOk now to the over run, all I can say is christ guys it feels like a war zone. I always wanted a car that sounded like a IMSA race car....now i got it. I have to somewhat agree that is is slightly overdone, but.... I have the MPE without a DP (one is coming) so it is a semi bypass design. Now with flaps closed it burbles about the same as it did open before the tune. Now with them open it is hunting season. I am not sure I want to put a DP on now. We could tone it down slightly but I would rather have it this way than none at all. So far it rocks. My plan is to adapt it a bit more then head to the rollers to see how it fairs compared to stock and the JB4.Awesome job Dzenan & Halim\n\n\n\nPost a video for f sake!  I wanna see people diving for cover behind park benches!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYea, remember I am not on the OBD agent. So I need to plug the lap top in, log in to both the BM3 agent software and log into my account then open dashboard and and then I can go off wifi and the dashboard will stay active and I can log multiple times and it will store it on the computer till I return home to wifi? Remember I am the electronics dummyAlso did you notice that when you flashed your car the rear tail lights were active until it finished? Kind of odd\n\n\n\nStage 2 with stock DP?\n\n\n\n\n\nOn man I forgot to mention one huge thing, no F'n cold start! So nice and different without it. A slight rough idle on the initial start but then smooths out shortly after. Can't believe I forgot to mention it...... must have been all that gunfire\n\n\n\nwelcome to the BM3 club, OP!!!! the over-run is intoxicating lol. when you get a DP, it's going to sound nuts. if catless, it's too loud for daily driving. i haven't heard exhaust and sport-cat DP yet in person.me,HandmadeShiftsandrecycledAlvarolled thru a parking garage to take pics, and security kicked us out because he thought my over-run was revving. I made sure to show him my brake lights while the exhaust was still crackling when he followed me out.in hind-sight, maybe we should have cruised there in comfort mode?",

    "content": "I got a CEL after a few thousand miles. Obviously can't take it to the dealer. What's the next step? Check the error code with a scanner? Re-install stock DP? This is exactly what I didn't want to deal with when getting a super expensive cat DP .Thanks\n\nWhich downpipe did you get?\n\nLike Maniax said, knowing the downpipe MFG will be key.  Fabspeed is not supposed to trigger a CEL.  Same goes with the new revision Remus, which is what I have on my car and I have had no issues.\n\nfabspeed\n\nThere are about a hundred different things that can cause a CEL.  Def scan to see what the CEL code says first before jumping to conclusions\n\nP0420. Catalyst system efficiency below threshold (bank1)\n\n\n\nYou got any other mods, bi0hazard?\n\nI believe FabSpeed guarantees no CEL.\n\nMight not be the downpipe itself. Could be the O2 sensors weren't seated in the pipe properly or they were damaged during install. Or the downpipe itself isn't seated properly against the exhaust manifold.\n\nJust clear it and move on with life.\n\nAll:  thanks for the responses.  the CEL actually went out after the code was read out.  fabspeed is very responsive and on the case.  will follow-up in this thread if CEL comes back.\n\n[QUOTE=DrAnzo2.0;22885649]I believe FabSpeed guarantees no CEL.It doesn't say there is a guaranty, just make the statement, no check engine light.  I have one, no issues.\n\nAll:  This thread was meant to troubleshoot my problem, and not to speculate about manufacturer guarantee.\n\nExpect that light to come back on. I had an ER catted DP in my old car and it would come on ~200km after I would clear the codes. I have friends with the same DP in their cars and have never had a code. Seems to be hit and miss whether a catted DP will be enough for the stock computer.Now I just remove the cats and ignore the engine light, checking every so often to see if it's just the same old codes. Maybe one day I'll get a tune for it, but for now I just want it for the sound.\n\nGood lord, quit ur whining, you've modified a modern car, expect the ECU to get a little perturbed every now and then. Man up and purchase an OBD scanner so you can check and clear codes...it takes all of 5-10 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\nThere're a ton of Fabspeed 200-cell DP CELs if you do search.First, it was because in their early design they modified O2 sensor position, trying to fool it to avoid CELs. But BMW DME is smart enough to detect the trick. This pre mature idea caused numerous CELs and was where most early warranty claims came from. Fabspeed took care of the situation and moved sensor back to original place.Since then, HJS 200 cell core seems to be effective enough alone. Much less CELs were reported and most of them were for user/shop installation error. There actually were a few CELs caused by Catalyst system efficiency below threshold, but they're covered by Fabspeed and users were made quiet. So they kept advertising the product CEL free.Let me be very fair and transparent to community as I have always been. Fabspeed high flow DP is a high quality part from user feedback, but catalyst by nature is really consumables. All cats wear over time and give lights eventually, a matter of time and how hard car is driven. HJS 200 cat is the only part of whole thing that's responsible for CEL (given everything else is done right), but even HJS as its manufacture does not make a 100% CEL free claim let alone a guarantee of it, how is it possible Fabspeed do that? What they do is they tell you no CEL when knowing it's good 9 times out of 10 and cover you if it fails. And consider that 10% (the number I made up, but you get the idea) warranty as fabrication scrap cost. Not to mention on JB4(old days) or flash tune users would never get to see CEL anyway.\n\nlol go catless bruh\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=TT1351;22886175]",

    "content": "Has anyone upgraded their TMAP sensors to 3.5 or 4.0 Bar to allow more boost.\n\nYou cannot do that without reprogramming the DME. 3.5 bar is = 50psi - don't you think that is enough for you?Sorry - misread that. PTF will have support for 3.5 TMAP soon I believe otherwise you need to go JB4.\n\ni have been trying to successfully tune my car for a while now using BM3. When WOT at high rpms with anything more than 18-19 pounds of boost the car dumps fuel. So thinking going to 3.5 bar TMAP might help\n\nOn some of our N55 tunes we reflash to use the 3.5bar sensor if running above 20psi. Technically the 3.5bar sensor reads up to 50psi but after you factor in atmospheric pressure which is ~1bar the positive pressure cap ends up being just over 21psi for the 2.5bar sensor and just over 36psi for the 3.5bar sensor.\n\n\n\nI'll bet if your running near 19psi consistently then you would be over working the HPFP without an upgrade. Do you ever get a 11A0002 code? I wold hope this is being discussed with Dzenan & Halim and they are presenting an solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot 23psi on Awron out of my M2 yesterday David",

    "content": "I just used theTechnicPNP harnessto bypass active sound design (ASD) in my M2.  Install went exactly as described in the thread.The difference is remarkable.  I wish I had been more scientific and taken before and after SPL measurements; I think it's gotta be 6 dB at 70 MPH.For those of you concerned about the cabin noise or irritated by the artificial sound you should do this mod.  This is the absolute best modification I've made to a car ever.  Thank youTechnic!This car sounds great and the ASD detracts from that.  Of course there's more noticeable road noise with the ASD bypassed, but that's obviously a separate matter.  I suspect BMW cranked up the ASD to cover for the missing sound deadening.  But the effect is overwhelming IMHO and I'm absolutely glad it's gone!\n\nThanks for posting, I am going to definitely do this mod.  From the videos I have seen it appears pretty intrusive when you go into sport or sport plus modes.  It will be nice to just have the natural sounds in the cabin.\n\nBuddy, can you please do some recording for us as we would be interested to hear the difference.\n\nPlease make a comparison video between with and without ASD. That would be greatly appreciated.Another point is the question if you really need this option. What if we just code it out or pull the grey ASD plug from the HK amplifier? Either option is a lot cheaper than paying for this cable and it does the same thing.MR\n\n\n\nSorry, I love you guys, but I'm not gonna tear my trunk apart again for comparative analysis. I wish I had borrowed a friend's SPL meter and done a before and after for a more scientific review but that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm just glad the ridiculous booming is gone and I can hear my own thoughts while driving this great car!\n\nCan someone confirm that this does not also disable the electronic flap for the exhaust. Obviously that would be a very undesirable side effect. BTW I ordered one today\n\nNot sure why it would affect the exaust, but I can confirm it does not. Same, sick cold start sounds!\n\nOnly reason I asked is that the comfort and sport setting which affects the ASD also affects the exhaust flap. I didn't know if they were tied together in some way. Anyhow, good to hear that they are indeed separate. My bypass harness is on order.\n\nGot it. The link in my original post has a detailed 2er installation walk-through. Another member struggled with the connector keying, I think maybe they forgot to swap the housings. The guide covers all this. I used a spare hole in the main amp's mounts as a mount-point for the original cables tie-down then cable tied the new harness to the mount-point I removed the original cable from on the ASD module. It was easy to do a clean install.There's almost zero sound deadening in the trunk...made me wish I had a roll of dynamat on hand. There was a big slather of glue on the driver's wheel well in my car; someone must have been preparing to do an M235i sound dampening install when they realized it was an M2.\n\nInstalled mine tonight. One less item on my to-do list.\n\n\n\nThe real deal is much better than the artificial stuff.\n\nWould it be reasonable to remove a fuse to hear the car without asd prior to coding it out or bypass?  Apparently fuse 122 disables the radio and asd.\n\n\n\nDo you think there is any difference in comfort mode without ASD?\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks.   I plan to disable Asd ASAP.\n\nGuys, I want to film it someone when I have time, but I do not know how to do it. If I come up with an option to find a decent comparison I will make one. First need to order that cable and install it.MR\n\n\n\nDoes the ASD amplify the engine noise even at idle? Have noticed the engine is noisy in the cabin, in a bad rattly type of way.",

Is this something that the N55 in the M2 needs upgrading? What are other's thoughts on this and/or experience with replacing it on the M2/N55?Thanks!\n\nI haven't seen any threads as well, I suspect they are not used on the M2, no clue honestly just a guess, which maybe the reason there is no discussion. I'm sure if they were an item to upgrade forum members would be all over it.\n\nTheres an M2 one, listed in one of the threads or just ask PURE Turbos for the specific model. Also, its not an easy install at all...youd want to drop the turbo for it. Not sure if its possible to do without removing the turbo? Thats why I havent done it yet...not even worth the $ for the labor or the stress myself.So no, not worth it. Unless youre upgrading the turbo.\n\nI have this on my M2. Yes, the T9357 is the correct type. I installed it myself but it was really a PITA job. You don't have to remove the turbo but must remove the turbo inlet and charge pipes to get access to the 3 screws. The most difficult to remove is the bottom one, can be accessed from under the car.Last weekend I enjoyed it on my first track day. It has a nice sound and keeps the boost better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike lesser N55s using a very weak DV, M2 N55 has N20 version from factory, which is designed to handle boost up to 20psi. M2 runs a bit less boost than N20, either stock or tuned.Given the fact that N20 guys breaking it is rarely heard of, I would suggest M2 only needs it when doing 22+psi on PS2.Additionally, DV+ offers boost holding capability on lift off with its main spring, which is very useful to MT and 8AT because they lose boost a lot during shift. DCT however is in less need for it. This mainspring can cause noise BTW.Actually I did it (without mainspring). Do it again probably I wouldn't bother at all.\n\nSeanWRT--great info--thank you for posting!\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat info here, thanks guys!",

Enzo for sure Hands down.. he has Tuned me F30 and the Power Curve was Amazing.. Let's just say I could keep up with e90 M3s no issues..But enzo Support is on point Never an Issue..Enzo>RkTune\n\nI can't speak for enzo.However, I have used RK Tunes, and consider Jordan to be a friend.He's always been great, and a very talented tuner.\n\nSome examples here of his past work and I personally know the owners of the BMWs. It's a pleasure to know Enzo as well as the first Bootmod3 Dealer and Custom Tuner in Tri-State. I have to add, Enzo's Backend Flash was used on my friend's M235 FBO who did the First F series N55 World Record Sept 2016 at 11.2 in the 1/4 mile.EnzoTuned 550 beating M5 CP with BMS Stg1Another example\n\nId go with RK tunes. From the reviews Ive heard regarding both. Just leave it to Jordan and you wont have any issues or worries.\n\n\n\nstay away from Rk.no customer service, no money back guarantee even if his tune causes nothing but misfires.I can name multiple people who have had the same issues.I left Enzo to try RK because it was before BM3 was available and i wanted the ability to flash multiple tunes.  Well, he couldnt get a single tune to work on my car without misfiring, this was after 8 hours on his dyno, than i rented a dyno a week later out of my own pocket for him to tune again. Same issue.  So I basically spent about 2,000$ with RK for him to say sorry, I can't help you and I'm not giving you any money back.Walked back into Enzo's shop, explained what I did, and he flashed me back without hesitation, no questions.   No misfires, no bullshit.RK and Jordan have been doing lots of things lately, sponser tuner for bimmerfest etc, spending money on getting his name out, but his customer service and business practices still have lots of room to grow.But, hey do what you want.\n\nLooks like Enzo is the go to.

    "content": "Hey guys, some great news we're really happy to share with everyone of the new BM3 features.OBD Unlock and the new OFFLINE Flasher (flashing without the need for internet, similar to Spotify downloaded songs you can play offline) features are now live in a wider closed beta.If youd like to participate in this closed beta testing round let us know through our tech support portal as were doing it one car at a time and enable access to the feature on a per user account basis.To get started make sure to download the new OBD Agent version 0.9.42. iOS and Android apps arent updated yet so youd need to use a laptop for this round of testing.Overview of whats been covered:OBD Unlock:- New convenience option to unlock your DME and tune the car with BM3. The previous bench type unlock is still fully supported.- Unlock DME without pulling it out of the car or sending out for unlock- NO SPECIAL CABLES or hardware required. Uses the same ENET cable still that you can get on Amazon for around $16-20. No waiting time for special cables to be shipped or waiting on us to ship them as they're available through Amazon- Instant activation and OTS map download! No waiting after purchase- OBD unlock for new cars/install time around 260 seconds start to finish instead of 10-50minutes with other F series tuning solutions.- Revert back to Stock and locked. No chance of tamper code showing once flashed back.- No flash counter limitations - our dev cars have been flashed well over 1000 times. This has always been a BM3 feature.- Flash date freeze - unique BM3-first feature, no other tool supports today. Flash date never changes when flashing with BM3.- Flash counter freezes after OBD unlockOFFLINE Flasher:- Flash without internet access- Fastest flash time on F series platform. ~260secs for unlock flash, ~40secs for just a map switch! Others using USB/DCAN cables take 4-5x longer such as tuners using rebranded Frieling (FRC) USB cables and Bimmergeeks or similar USB/DCAN cables with OTG adapters used by some Android apps.- Twin DME cars (N63tu and S63tu) flash at the same time and in parallel and take the same time as single DME cars to flash. Other tools using USB/DCAN cables can only do one at a time due to limitations in connectivity pushing the initial install time and map switch time to well over an hour or 18mins for a simple map switch!- No special cables, hardware Or additional software required, just the standard ENET BMW coding cable that you can get on Amazon for around $16-20.- Whether using iOS and Android apps or just a laptop with a browser, maps are downloaded locally and flashed with no internet connection required. Flashing in remote areas, underground garages, bad wifi, is a non-issue.- Manages map updates automatically in case of tuning (custom) updates and downloads them prior to flashing without users needing to worry about managing it and you can save your downloaded map files anywhere you like (google drive, dropbox, iCloud, etc for backup if you like)- Backs up existing DME coding data automatically without users having to worry about it like with other tools and automatically re-applies it after flashing- The original online-type flasher for the DME stays in place as a secondary option through testing- TCU flashing (GTS flash) requires internet access still but we're looking to move it into offline mode as well.Some dev work thats still in progress that wed like to finish this week:- Add obd unlock support for N20, N63tu and the rest of N55. Very quick to do and we expect to finish it this week.- Update flash screen with new progress bars with time estimate countdown- OTS Map updates and new additions to the OTS Maps screen across all F series- Finalize closed beta testing of the above 2 new featuresThere is no additional cost to the end user for any of these features and it is bundled in the cost of a BM3 software license along with all existing features already provided.\n\n\n\nOffline flasher! Boom! Amazing work guys thats a hell of an update!\n\nI'd like to enroll in the beta!\n\nMTWOthis is insane!More Exciting News here, more than when the others announced solely OBD Unlock with nothing else haha\n\nI would like to enroll for beta testing as well but it sounds like a laptop is required?  Can I enroll when iOS solution is available?\n\nGreat news .I have unlocked my DME last week through CMD . But now it is showing Tamper code , Could I reverse it through the cable and remove the Tamper code ?!Ps : car is not tuned yet\n\n\n\n\n\nSeems like BM3 is the best one tune on the market given their capabilities\n\nI believe 499$ but the license can be sold to another person if you sell your car\n\nThat's quite alot of change for a HEX tune. Though it falls within The standard price range if other tunes. I like BM3 given their continual active development and range of features. This offline tune option is pretty cool and I didn't even know I wanted it till now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the GTS transmission tune compare to stock? I was interested in doing that as well, is that available through the OBD flash?\n\n\n\nThis is awesome! No additional cost or special cable required! NICE JOB PTF!!!I can finally get back to BM3.\n\nThis offline flasher of new features means a lot to people like me having bad connection to oversea server 365 days a year.Also Appreciate your continuous improvement on tuning front, what really matters at the end of the day.Thanks PTF.",

    "content": "Hey guys, really happy to announce the OFFLINE Flasher is now out of closed beta for any existing registered/unlocked users that have an S55, N55, N20 or N26. Only exception is Dual DME cars (N63tu/S63tu) that are still in beta for a couple days. This applies to any existing and already unlocked BM3 users.Overall impressions from beta have been very positive. Flash times are the fastest out there we've seen atjust 40secs for a map switch, maybe even a touch quicker.Offline flasher also incorporates a preconditions analysis check we believe is unique to bootmod3 in the aftermarket along side BMW's own factory flash tools. Some of these were there before but now have been redesigned and further expanded. This should help prevent any issues for those out in the wild while flashing further solidifying the flash process.In case any the following preconditions happen, flash will not begin:- engine running- immobilizer system not unlocked- gear box input speed not zero- gear box output speed not zero- vehicle speed not zero- ignition needs restart, ignition off-on is required- programming voltage insufficient- ignition off (clamp 15 is off)- vehicle's electrical system voltage too low- temperature too high- temperature too lowFlash button in the app now defaults to OFFLINE flashing. The old method which used an internet connection to the servers is still there but going forward will most likely be removed for the DME. S55 TCU flash will continue to use the internet connection method, for now.We'm working on incorporating some progress bars for the flash progress screen now and that'll be in the next update very soon. OBD Unlock closed beta testing is going really well as well and we're hoping to have that released in the open very soon as well. Let us know if any questions.\n\nHere is how it works\n\n:-)Game changer continues\n\nTried offline today. Worked fine!Who has and would share a log of latest OTS on N55 EWG STG2 93OCT?Want to check and compare.\n\n\n\nWhen will OBD unlock be out? Thanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a ticket they'll get back no worry\n\nThe website is stating that OBD bench unlock is no longer required on both the bench unlock service page and the bootmod3 product page for N55 platform. Is this the case or is it still just in closed beta? I know it's already been asked, but I'm just curious as to the language on site. I would rather hold off until it's freely available before I place and order for a license.Separate question: I know that during beta testing it's required that you have a Windows laptop. If/when its out of beta, is it possible to use an iOS laptop for flashing/logging, or is it only available for iOS mobile app?.Thanks in advance.\n\nQuote:you can go ahead and purchase a license on our website for it, sign up onwww.bootmod3.net, connect to the car and download and start the OBD Agent. Once signed up click on the VIN that shows up and send us a screenshot of the vehicle software IDs on the vehicle details screen and if support isn't already added we'll get that resolved.- N55 Licensehttps://www.protuningfreaks.com/prod...5i-x3-x4-x5-m2- How to Activatehttps://bootmod3.atlassian.net/wiki/...e+your+License- Tech Supporthttps://bootmod3.atlassian.net/servi...stomer/portals- Frequently Asked Questionshttps://bootmod3.atlassian.net/wiki/...-+bootmod3+FAQLet us know if any questions[BM3 Enthusiast Group|https://www.facebook.com/groups/1995370330682747/]I saw yesterday 6x N55's EWG were OBD unlocked and 2x S63TU (M6) as well.Only thing they HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend for First Time is Battery Charger Hooked up because S55 especially drain the battery while in ignition.

    "content": "I started hearing an annoying high frequency rattle/buzz from the downpipe area of my car, which starts around 3K RPM under load. I am not able to reproduce this sound by just revving the car. The sound developed about a week after I had the SportCat installed with a new gasket and clamps. Planning on bringing it back to the shop who installed it on Monday. Anyone have any ideas?\n\ni couldnt really hear it from the video. hoping it was sometihng wrong on the installer's end. Tried searching the forums, didnt see anyone else having the same problem. Let us know if you resolve it or get any updates!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI can’t hear the described rattle/buzz in the video.  The fact it happens only when the car is in motion suggests to me that pipes are not sitted properly in the clamp, or the clamp was not properly tightened and worked itself loose over time.  It’s also possible the sensor(s) have become loose.My friend and I installed the Fabspeed Sport Cat on my car 2.5 months and 2500 mi. ago.   No rattle in my case nor have I read any on the forum.  Extremely happy with its sound and looking forward to its full performance potential when tuned.\n\n\n\nI believe there was a thread reporting the very same issue just a few weeks back. Fabspeed replied themselves.Concerns me as I have ordered this part and it's a going to take weeks to get to me, hope this isn't a systemic issue with the product.Please report back once you've had it investigated.\n\n^ yes please.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlad it turned out to be an install issue\n\n\n\nI had mine installed 2 days ago. I did my first cold start in my garage today and there is a very noticeable metallic ringing sound coming from the car, somewhere. Im going to try to record it tomorrow. I am really hoping it is just an install thing where something has loosened.I expect these components deal with serious temperature fluctuation so perhaps for whatever reason something is loose. I just worry what that can mean if I have to drive it fo a few days before the workshop is open again to inspect it.\n\n\n\nThanks for the link, I recall that thread now you point it out.Seems an unresolved, unexplained situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't think this is an issue with the downpipe. I have a Wagner DP \"without any internals\" and my car does this as well, albeit not as loud or bad as OP's. The sound started after swapping DPs.Still, if anybody finds a solution for this, that would be greatEDIT: Mine only seems to do it on startup though.\n\ndoes anyone know the dimensions? i was looking at the pictures online is it just the cat thats replaced? or is it the whole Downpipe with the cat? something that i can fit in the car with the seats down? should be gettin installed soon\n\n\n\n",

If so, does anyone have a link for where I can purchase these items?Secondly, I'm also upgading the stock IC with an Active Autowerkes IC (not replacing the charge pipes at this time...). Are there any sort of gaskets on the attachment fittings to the stock charge pipes that need to be replaced? If so, does anyone have a link for where I can purchase these items?Thanks!\n\nI had my OEM downpipe swapped out for the Fabspeed Catless one at 4000kms (2450 miles) and the dealership did not swap the gasket out for a new one.As for the intercooler, nope! No fittings or gaskets need to be replaced for that job.\n\nThere's no need, I swapped out the gasket and clamps...but that's because I love to swap out stuff HAHA.Looking at the \"old\" and new one...both looked to be in the same condition. And I swapped around 1500 miles or so I think?So, no, save your moneyFor the intercooler, nothing to replace, the charge pipes do have O-Rings in them which you would transfer to your new charge pipe (although the FTP Motorsport charge pipes come with new O-Rings and C-clips). Also, if you haven't already purchased the AA intercooler, don't get it...get a Wagner or CSF if you want actual performance increase in cooling.\n\nTo add to the list of replies, I did mine at 700 and didn't replace the gasket.\n\nI’ve swapped downpipes 3 times (-> Fabspeed, -> stock, -> Fabspeed).  I’m still using the original clamps without issue, gasket is still on the stock DP.\n\nThanks for the info!",

I don't see an option to code it out with Carly. I'm not familiar with E-SYS and can't find the cheat sheet for it, at the moment. Can E-SYS disable them? If not, what about JB4 or Bootmod3?\n\nThis seems to be the reason:https://www.quora.com/Why-do-modern-...n-the-over-runA \"backfire\" should not happen in normal stock vehicle operation, as that indicates an overly rich condition where fuel is hitting the exhaust.\n\nHex has a tune that can eliminate the burbles if you want, or they have a tune that offers more pops and burbles then stock. With that said, on older cars it was something that would drive you crazy trying to fine the cause, exhaust leak or whatever.\n\nThis was done on purpose by the original BMW engineers. They are marketing a sports car, and with that comes all of the ambience associated with it. As you change the driving modes, you'll notice that it becomes more prominent. This is intentional to \"enhance\" the driving experience. It's caused by injector overrun after the throttle plate closes. This dumps un-ignited fuel into the exhaust which is then ignited by the heat of the exhaust. This causes backfires.The only way to eliminate the factory burbles and backfires, is for a tune to override it, but that would put your warranty at risk. IMHO, it's not worth it to void your warranty to rid yourself of backfires, unless you plan on modding, in which case it's moot lol\n\nIt's one of my favorite parts of driving the car. Not sure why you'd want to code it out.\n\nYou can drive in comfort mode all the time, that has no burbles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, do not believe in this article. At least the theory doesn't apply to BMW turbocharged engines, all of which burble with a tune.https://www.quora.com/Why-do-modern-...n-the-over-runSecondly, overrun has nothing to do with rich or lean.Running rich or lean is refered to as the AFR of the ignition in combustion stroke phase. Overrun is the ignition at exhaust stroke when timing valve is largely open and part of ignition takes place in exhaust manifold, which leads to incomplete fuel burn and leaves carbon residual on exhaust tail pipes, the source of misperception of running rich. As for functional purposes, depending on manifold design, overrun may or may not help keep the momentum of turbine on liftoff (to improve on/off turbo responsiveness). Mainly it's there for a little sports car drama - see those Huracans burble like crazy from factory without even a turbo?@Stage IVDinan Elite for most applications runs factory rich, trying to be safe providing a warranty. The exceptions though are the 235/335/435 N55 Stage 4 big turbo. They run slightly leaner because piggyback is incapable of keeping up AFR with such boost (over stock). However, M2, in a higher tuning state from factory, doesn't get as much boost/power from STG4 than its N55 counterparts and is still programmed to be factory rich or somewhere close, which is way too rich and kills a bit power.\n\nHonestly, I got more \"looks\"/attention with my Laguna Seca Blue 335 than I do with the F87...the only guys (yes guys, girls don't care about cars unless it tells them what might be in your bank account!) that even seem to notice are guys in other M cars (3/4's) and the Golf GTI/R guys.  Otherwise it seems most think it's just another blue BMW...except my neighbor who bitches about the noise (MPE + SportCat).  I guess it all depends where you live.But if you want to slide under the radar AND be fuel efficient...a Prius may have been a better choice for you.\n\n\n\n",

I have driven around my block and gone back to check again but they're still closed. The car shifts to neutral automatically once I leave the car, maybe that has something to do with it, but I'm not sure though.If anyone knows what's going on, please let me know! Photo:View post on imgur.comThanks\n\nAlso, it seems as though the exhaust goes REALLY quiet once it hits 4th gear in all different modes. Is this normal behavior? I've read that the valves do close in the higher gears, but wasn't sure if it was that drastic\n\nIt won't have anything to do with the car being in neutral.I have the Remus installed and my valves are open when idling stationary.Maybe that's how the Eisenmann operates with the valve closed at idle? Do you have a Gopro or similar? I drove around with the camera facing inside the exhaust to make sure my valves were operating, as opposite to you i didn't think my valves were closing.\n\nProdigy.it uses the stock EVC so I'm just confused at to what's going on. Hoping some other people know better on how the stock EVC operates!\n\nOh I just saw the Remus also uses the stock EVC, woops. Do you also notice that the exhaust gets much quieter 4+ gear?\n\n\n\nValve operation is exactly the same across ALL exhausts.That being said, I had the Eisenmann exhaust. When the valves are closed it becomes INCREDIBLY quiet, thats just how it is. And Im catless, cant imagine what its like with stock downpipe.Stock valve function makes 0 sense to me lol. Regardless of mode itll close at certain RPM ranges.Grab the BMS Canflap Module, its the best thing! Open when you want it, closed when you dont!It doesnt appear theres anything wrong with your set up.Also, not sure if anyone can confirm but it seems like stock valve operation isnt just 100% open or 100% closed, it can range from 0-100% say like 65% for instance depending on RPM/Pedal %.Again, stock valve operation is terrible imo. A valve controller is a MUST with any aftermarket exhaust. Stock not so much because the difference is minimal, and REMUS not too drastic due to the design (Ive had REMUS as well). Currently have Akrapovic + Catless and its perfect with a controller.\n\nthankstehboost. I was thinking of either the bms canflap or the macht shnell evc.

What does that mean?\n\nI was under the assumption the constant 15-30s flashes were to say that the flaps are still open. Double tap again for the solid single flash means flaps will close, and remote should no longer flash.\n\n\n\nI double tap and the light does not flash 5 times for me.  It does flash once every 20 seconds or so, but I don't hear anything when I double tap it (i.e. flap opening)???  Should I be able to hear the flap actuator?   Also, do you put the car into Sport, Sport+ before double tapping the MPE button, or after??  Does it matter?Haven't played with it much, so curious to know.thx.\n\n\n\nIt quickly flashes 5 times and after that  'blinks' once every 5 sec to tell you it's on.The MPE valve is a stand-alone system, independent of anything. It can work as long as there is a power supply of correct type. I wish MPE valve control was incorporated into OEM system. Simpler better.\n\nAs the guys stated above you install a bypass plug in the factory harness and stow it away. The MPE has its own independent activation circuit controlled by the owner. You decide when you want sport or track. In sport it is more of a flow thru design meaning instead of all the exhaust gasses going into the can the out either one or two exit points depending on the valve position with the MPE the gasses flow by the can and create the sound when the valves are closed. When they are open this increases the flow even more but the gas never really must travel thru the can first...always past. This is why I don't understand  BMW's stand that there is no HP increase with its installation. My baseline dyno runs showed an aprox of 5hp/7tq increase but the car was still adapting upWhen I installed it the first thing i noticed it that it was a more pronounced tone, not as deep and reserved but more in your face. Also you get way more turbo flutter effect sound out the back. I think that it is do to hearing less can induced sound and more direct exhaust....which might have been a good in-between like the S55 MPE which goes thru the can in comfort and past in sport +On the controller you have to tap it twice quickly....no lazy one two tapping and right away it will flash 5 time acknowledging you have activated it the flash intermittently after that reminding your in track mode. If I open the door I can hear the flaps activate but not in the car with the windows up. But the sound is a tell tale when your on the gas. It would be more obvious if the design were different I think\n\nok, well mine is definitely not working correctly then...no 5 flashes.  Will have to take it into the dealer and get them to have a look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=m2ruder;22840336]Here you go.....https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxfwu2asux..._3990.MOV?dl=0so tempting! to get that diffuserLooks OEM!!!!!!!https://www.ebay.com/itm/FOR-2016-17...hZmBBm&vxp=mtrSorry we chacha.. about the MPE\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=AGM2;22840511]\n\n[QUOTE=m2ruder;22840601]\n\n[QUOTE=AGM2;22840633][QUOTE=m2ruder;22840601]\n\n[QUOTE=m2ruder;22840660][QUOTE=AGM2;22840633]\n\n[QUOTE=m2ruder;22840660][QUOTE=AGM2;22840633]\n\nAre you sure the small switch is on?

Read in the other thread that people are having all sorts of problems with the remote staying connected to the trunk module and then the flaps are automatically closing on them.  Seems to be down to two issues:  BT interference from phones and watches and potentially loose fuse in the trunk.  I will replace the battery in the controller (then test), check the fuse in the trunk (then test) and lastly if I have to leave my phone and my watch in the house (then test)...seems like a lot of work on my end for something that cost $3,500...I mean why they made this a BT connection in the first place rather than a connected \"Hard\" switch is beyond me...c'mon BMW...you're better than that.FWIW, if any of you are having this same issue, there are guys that are getting their systems replaced under warranty, so BMW obviously knows it's an issue.\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=Anthony1s;22840908][QUOTE=m2ruder;22840660]",

What is it?\n\nHow many kms has the car done?  Mine made a very noticable whining noise for the first few 100kms when coasting to a stop with your foot lightly on the brake, it is to do with the brakes bedding in and the cross hatch pattern on the new discs.It is normal and will go away.\n\nits now got 300km, been the same since new and not really fadingwill see how i go after a couple more\n\n\n\nDid you code out ASD?It's been known to produce a static noise in some cars. Getting a harness will fix that.https://technicpnp.com/product/asd-bypass-harness/\n\n\n\nMine does the same thing. Figure it’s a characteristic of the car. 750 miles on the clock.\n\nYup, I noticed it too. Sounded like a Tesla when I lightly touched the brakes. Very noticeable in the first 100-200 miles and was attributed to the brake pads bedding in on the drilled rotors.Now I have 1300 miles and I only notice it in parking garages.\n\nThese calipers drag too, so you'll hear them rubbing rotors even when not braking unless the road noise drowns them out. However, you might also be hearing gear whine from the transmission. When decelerating in gear you can definitely hear it if you have ASD coded out/bypassed. This car has solid subframe mounts, and minimal sound deadening materials, so a lot of the NVH that would otherwise be muted is transmitted into the cabin.",

    "content": "As the post says, I would like to go FBO, but I'm concerned about a couple things. After looking at all the dyno charts, and reading the tuning threads, I've come to the conclusion that the HPFP will fail to keep up likely before turbo is maxed out. I've seen only a handful of cases of the opposite occurring, but then again, that could just be my limited access to information (I don't have ALL cases in front of me) and I don't want that to read that I'm set in stone about that assessment.So, if going FBO and flash tune is likely going to substantially increase my propensity for fuel cut, especially under high load/high RPM scenarios, I'm not exactly comfortable or happy with that outcome. Previously, I haven't seen anyone develop a HPFP on the previous N54/N55 market either, which concerns me. I don't want to add a second fuel system to manage via PI setup, and it greatly increases the difficulty of reverting back to stock trim if if/when I decide to part out.This is a long-winded post to basically ask one thing. Is there anything currently in the pipeline for a HPFP upgrade, and if so, can someone point me in the direction of a development thread/information on who is working on one?The market is large enough, the other F series guys I'm sure would like one, as well as the other N55 motors out there. Every other DI car I've owned (a handful now) had HPFP upgrades relatively quick to market once the limit had be reached.\n\n\n\n^yep, Dinan has a full upgraded fuel pump ($935) as well as a kit ($235). Check out their website for details.\n\nThe Dinan LPFP upgrade only helps with fuel pickup on low tank levels while on track. It does not address HPFP issues.\n\n\n\nI apologize ahead of time for this post...but there are so many acronyms to keep up with...and I have seen these a few times now...I assume HPFP stands for High Pressure Fuel Pump?But...FBO?...again, sorry for the dumb question.\n\nFBO=full bolt on (intake, intercooler, downpipe tune)\n\nHaving the lpfp supply great will help stretch out the hpfp maximum delivery.  Has anyone actually logged lpfp upon hpfp crashing?  Not the ecu value as thats just a modeled number.\n\nhttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1454297Quote:TTFS - OE S55 dual HPFP setup - will require tune/coding to get S55 secondary pump to workhttps://www.facebook.com/TuningTechF...18218138223616XDI - non OE PnP HPFP upgrade also due out soon toohttp://www.xtreme-di.com/index_files/HPFP35.htm\n\nThe Dinan LPFP will not help at all...There are 2 solutions for the HPFP, Custom dual set up from the S55 (M3/M4 motor)...or the XDI as linked above.Im FBO, on 91 octane check out my thread...only a minor dip in HPFP pressure at 5.5k rpm as with all logs including my stock tune. Made 403 hp/465 lb ft torque:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1437086Read SeanWRTs comment or reach out to him! Hes extremely knowledgeable and helpful.With that tune I can go to and past redline with no signs of HPFP cutting out, its smooth all the way up! Does great!! Is it stressing the HPFP? Yeah probably...Really depends on the tuning! Highly recommend bootmod3. I had one of the other tunes out there (non BM3) and my HPFP dipped over 1400 PSI across the power band....HAHA! So tuning is key. But yes that is probably the biggest bottleneck after FBO, our HPFP is weak lol.That being said you can still go FBO as I have, and be fine! Tuning is key, the OTS BM3 maps do great but you can make it even better with a custom PTF tune!\n\n\n\nHey guys,So Ive got my 2018 M2 arriving in May/June 2018 and was wondering if the HPFP wouldve been resolved.\n\nNothing to resolve from BMW’s perspective - there’s sufficient fueling for stock power levels.  It’s when you start pushing it that the hpfp can’t keep up.I’m eager to see one or more of the aftermarket hpfp offerings in the works go on sale as a kit (and the tuners to put some code behind it).\n\nSo far the Xtreme-DI pump looks to be the only option for those that don't want to deal with PI or meth. I'm hoping there is more information on it soon, as they are still looking for dev cars according to their site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you never tune a modern bmw turbocharged engine and have to do it, start with JB4. It offers 24/7 easy access to datalog without needing anything other than your cell phone, nothing else can match. Reading datalog is essential part from beginning to the end and the first thing to study. You must know meaning of everything shown there and why and how it should be. When you know well enough and tweak various parameters and remove one power/drivability restriction after another and finally find limits with piggyback. Move on to proper flash tune.WinOLs is for true tuners and MHD as a platform is wide open for everyone, while BM3 is ahead in definitive table editor which is more noob friendly.I don't think you would go this far because if you were, you would've played with MHD which has been there with E platform for many years. Good luck!\n\nUpgrade the turbo, intercooler, and downpipe.Get a quality flash tune or Dinan stage 4 if you're a warranty pussy like myself.\n\nHere is one my favorite tunes to listen to when driving.https://open.spotify.com/track/2XaW5...TYW1Lfi-Rc1q3wNah, but I Sean WRT is right.

Everything else being equal, smaller turbo makes higher intake temp and thus require even more cooling. A turbo upgrade in fact make you less in need for bigger intercooler. But in your case focus less on turbo, because all STG1 turbo regardless the maker of it are the same flow wise, aren't much better than M2 stock, me speaking as a user.I value the balance of flow efficiency (pressure loss, something turbo have to work harder to compensate) and cooling capacity and thus would go for the freest flow one (often mean smallest) with adequate cooling for the power we're making.",

Plus, possibly some diffusion of NRE in the cost.  Pole positions are not designed to that level in order to save cost. Also, a factory set-up, slider probably saved me $1,500 or more in installation and didn't have to cut/weld my floor.  They are truly drop-in.I wanted to keep my M2 all BMW where I could, a la the Porsche factory GT2, GT3, 918 seats.Nothing like factory design.  Basic pole positions, in person, are ok.

Pole positions are designed to meet FIA crash standards w/a 5/6 point FIA approved harness.  The BMW seats are designed for safety with both harnesses and for road use with a seatbelt to meet EU regulations.   So, I'm much more comfortable with these seats in my car when I'm driving on the street.  Pole positions are designed for off-road performance and \"probably\" are ok on the street and likely not for the loads of a 3 point belt.

If you are so worried about your neighbours, I would not recommend MPE haha.\n\nIf you hold the pedal down a little bit during cold start and increase the revs to around 1300 or so, it quiets down. You can also have cold start coded out. I start with my garage closed to keep from annoying neighbors.\n\nwhat is the point of cold start anyways?\n\n\n\nNight and day between M2 and M240iOne is a proper M car and one isn't.End of.\n\n\n\nGo M2. I bought a M240i first and while i really did enjoy the car, the looks, sound, and overall more aggressive nature of the M2 for not much more money makes it worth it. Sold my M240i (and while my intent was to jump into a Supra; outside reasons made this not possible; i ended up getting a great deal on a M2 and had to jump on that instead. best decision i made!\n\n",

If you're really worried about it, ask around in your regions sub forum to find a mod friendly SA/dealership.\n\nThis is why I had the dealership install mine.Confirmed first that they wouldn't \"flag\" the car in the system prior to the install.  Win-win.  They get some cash to do the install, I know that a BMW trained tech does the work and that they won't void my warranty.\n\nSame. Had the dealership do install\n\nI installed mine myself, didn’t remove it or the aftermarket intercooler when I had my car serviced.  Dealer didn’t say anything about it.\n\nNo need to remove the cat for service. It's an exhaust mod and has nothing to do with the powertrain warranty. An aftermarket intake and intercooler are a different story. Depending on your dealer they may or may not be cool with those.\n\nJust curious - for those that had the dealership install the DP, how much did they charge?\n\n\n\nAlso wondering on dealership install price?\n\nThanks all, as I have 5year servicing plan through the dealership I suppose I should ask them but I assumed it would probably require me to take them off.I will have the eventuri intake and the fabspeed fitted. I reckon removing the intake should be easy but the downpipe will require hoist and probably some more expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI installed it myself, when I went in for the 1200 mile service the tech noticed it right away and complimented the quality of the cat, loved it even more after he test drove it with the MPE exhaust and the red button activated.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dont see it being a problem with any dealership.",

    "content": "Hi all,I have been driving mine about a month or so and ran about 1.2k right now.From the 2nd day after picking up mine, she started to making clicking/ knocking sound interior that i very simliar to salt and small rocks hitting the body panel at idle only. When I take-off and give more gas it fades away. Only there when engine is warm.I think ppl usually hear this similar sound when engine is turned-off after running and when it cools down.I have asked the question before without the video clip and ppl said that it is no problem. And all of sudden it made big loud rock chip hitting on highway like sound 2 times.I feel that it is coming from the undercarriage of rear side of the car. Thinking noise is from exhaust. Mine has MPE not sure if this is related to it.After that loud noise, I felt unsafe so took it to the dealer and they found nothing. Said no noise whatsoever. It is weird as I hear it everytime. Noise never went away after i found it was there. Actually starting to louder since I found it.Anyone has anything simliar? Can anyone advise the source of this noise?? It is driving me nutssssssss....\n\nNo one?? ....\n\nIf its coming from your exhaust area and it goes away as you give it more gas... I would check your connections.   Maybe your gasket is missing or broke when you put on the exhaust.\n\nNo freaking clue what that could be... That is a mystery to me. Listened a few times to your video and I do not have any idea.MR\n\nNoise is arrhythmic. Always there at idle. Cannot hear it at rolling. However, the reason i suspect it is from exhaust is because it always give quick 2-3 knocks when it starts rolling then disappears again. I can sort of feel that it is coming from the rear side of undercarriage.... cannot exactly pinpoint it as it is not from the cabin... noise is still there regardless MPE open or not\n\nMy suggestion would be... Bring it to a specialist, put it up in the air and listen under the car while it is running at idle above you. This way you can get a lot closer to the noise.MR\n\nBringing the car in for break-in service this Saturday.I will reiterate this noise and tell them to check any loose bolt/screw/nuts on exhaust system.. Hope this annoying thing gets fixed....\n\nBrought the car for break-in service and dealer could not fix it as they said cannot hear anything while it is very dominant sound everytime I drive...I usually do hand carwash myself everytime but I made a chance to go touchless one from gas station because of too much salt on the road and my laziness... hahaAfter this blast touchless wash, sound went away for about a week and now it just came back on again.... I have made another video showing that sound is coming from the undercarriage.. I would not be able to tell where this is coming from unless I get mine hoisted with undercover opened...Here is the video..Anyone can help what this noise is?? OMG cant believe how annoying this is getting...\n\nhoping to see someone has or had similar experience..\n\nWhen u brought it in, they couldn't hear it? Pretty clear to me.  Can't say I've ever heard a sound like this before in any car...especially at a stand still.\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned before go to a specialist... Dealers are not specialists, they are replacement houses.Put it up in the air and try to find it. Keep trying until you have it. Not much use posting it here without doing that as well.You will find it, it is really noticeable. Just up in the air and chase the sound.MR\n\n\n\nElectrical issue with valves in exhaust?

I wish I had been more scientific and taken before and after SPL measurements; I think it's gotta be 6 dB at 70 MPH.For those of you concerned about the cabin noise or irritated by the artificial sound you should do this mod.  This is the absolute best modification I've made to a car ever.  Thank youTechnic!This car sounds great and the ASD detracts from that.  Of course there's more noticeable road noise with the ASD bypassed, but that's obviously a separate matter.  I suspect BMW cranked up the ASD to cover for the missing sound deadening.  But the effect is overwhelming IMHO and I'm absolutely glad it's gone!\n\nThanks for posting, I am going to definitely do this mod.  From the videos I have seen it appears pretty intrusive when you go into sport or sport plus modes.  It will be nice to just have the natural sounds in the cabin.\n\nBuddy, can you please do some recording for us as we would be interested to hear the difference.\n\nPlease make a comparison video between with and without ASD. That would be greatly appreciated.Another point is the question if you really need this option. What if we just code it out or pull the grey ASD plug from the HK amplifier? Either option is a lot cheaper than paying for this cable and it does the same thing.MR\n\n\n\nSorry, I love you guys, but I'm not gonna tear my trunk apart again for comparative analysis. I wish I had borrowed a friend's SPL meter and done a before and after for a more scientific review but that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm just glad the ridiculous booming is gone and I can hear my own thoughts while driving this great car!\n\nCan someone confirm that this does not also disable the electronic flap for the exhaust. Obviously that would be a very undesirable side effect. BTW I ordered one today\n\nNot sure why it would affect the exaust, but I can confirm it does not. Same, sick cold start sounds!\n\nOnly reason I asked is that the comfort and sport setting which affects the ASD also affects the exhaust flap. I didn't know if they were tied together in some way. Anyhow, good to hear that they are indeed separate. My bypass harness is on order.\n\nGot it. The link in my original post has a detailed 2er installation walk-through. Another member struggled with the connector keying, I think maybe they forgot to swap the housings. The guide covers all this. I used a spare hole in the main amp's mounts as a mount-point for the original cables tie-down then cable tied the new harness to the mount-point I removed the original cable from on the ASD module. It was easy to do a clean install.There's almost zero sound deadening in the trunk...made me wish I had a roll of dynamat on hand. There was a big slather of glue on the driver's wheel well in my car; someone must have been preparing to do an M235i sound dampening install when they realized it was an M2.\n\nInstalled mine tonight. One less item on my to-do list.\n\n\n\nThe real deal is much better than the artificial stuff.\n\nWould it be reasonable to remove a fuse to hear the car without asd prior to coding it out or bypass?  Apparently fuse 122 disables the radio and asd.\n\n\n\nDo you think there is any difference in comfort mode without ASD?\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks.   I plan to disable Asd ASAP.\n\nGuys, I want to film it someone when I have time, but I do not know how to do it. If I come up with an option to find a decent comparison I will make one. First need to order that cable and install it.MR\n\n\n\nDoes the ASD amplify the engine noise even at idle? Have noticed the engine is noisy in the cabin, in a bad rattly type of way.",

F87 is in the damn URL... cmon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting fire-proof underwear on here: The POTENTIAL issue for the clutch stop is that it is POSSIBLE that the clutch stop is too high which COULD stop the clutch from fully disengaging - meaning the clutch COULD be always dragging and the shafts COULD BE spinning with more resistance that they should be POTENTIALLY causing premature wear to the synchros. If you know that it's not dragging, you're good. This pedal likely would have no impact on that aspect if the travel is allowed to go through it's full range of motion allowing the clutch to fully disengage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what's the trick to remove the plastic covering that hides the top of the pedals, I found 2, 10mm nuts but can't contort myself to get a good view. TIA\n\n\n\nI'm looking to remove it to install an Ultimate Clutch Pedal, thanks for responding. Appreciate it, should have stated that in my original post.\n\n\n\nNo worries. Apparently after the 2 nuts are removed there are three spring clips that hold the cover in place.\n\nAfter removing the two 10mm nuts, the cover needs to be lifted past the two studs that the 10mm nuts attach to, once that is done there are three spring clips that attach the cover to the piece above it, takes some finesse but they pop out, unplug the two connectors and move the lower trim panel from the foot well.  Once done the fun begins.  Just an FYI.",

    "content": "I had an F80, and remember reading that sport plus was the \"unfiltered\" throttle mapping, where sport and comfort were \"watered down\".  It was the opposite of what I thought, since S+ was the most twitchy, I thought it was over boosted.  But then after reading it from an M engineer it actually made sense the way he explained it.So is the S+ in the M2 the unfiltered throttle mapping?And while I'm on the topic -The modes only tweak the steering, throttle mapping, and exhaust correct?  Not the suspension.   Since there is native (not adaptive) suspension in the M2.\n\n\n\nI definitely do not feel like the regular throttle mappings feel unfiltered or natural at all.From my experience:Comfort - slow and lazySport - hyper activeSport + - binary on or offSport + w/ dsc completely off - most closely related to an actual throttle cable.\n\n\n\n\n\nSport+ feels like it limits output in first gear under heavy accel compared to DSC off\n\nI don't think there is any such thing as unfiltered throttle on any modern car as they have throttle by wire so its running through the computer and coordinated with many other functions.  Might feel more natural because of the responsiveness but there is nothing natural about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI found the BMW M engineer interview I mentioned in my original post.I'm assuming the M2 and M3 mappings are similar?http://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho...d.php?t=975864In SPORT PLUS, all filter functions are deactivated and the engine responds directly to movements of the accelerator pedalQuote:So what are the differences between the EFFICIENT, SPORT and SPORT PLUS modes?In the SPORT and SPORT PLUS modes, the waste gates remain closed under partial load and the mass flow is routed through the turbines, to ensure that the turbo chargers are already rotating at a higher base speed even in standby. Moreover, certain special engine control functions are brought into play that accelerate activation of the turbo chargers. This means that the car responds more closely to the accelerator in SPORT and SPORT PLUS modes.Another important point is that we normally have to take the drive train into consideration when it comes to building up torque. As a rule, the engine is able to build up torque at a speed that is much faster than that with which the drive train can cope. You can imagine that the drive train then begins to behave like a torsion spring, which is first stretched out and then vibrates, resulting in juddering. To prevent such judders, it is necessary to dampen the engine's build up of momentum to allow a harmonic progression of its response characteristics.The rigid drive train of the new BMW M3 and BMW M4 is, however, optimised for a fast build-up of momentum, similar to a racing car, with a carbon fibre drive shaft, rear axle rigidly bolted to the body, suitably dimensioned drive shafts, etc. This means that the rigid drive train is also an important factor of the spontaneous entrance of the new BMW M3 and BMW M4. In EFFICIENT mode, everything is more levelled out, with a high orientation towards comfort. In stark contrast is the SPORT PLUS mode, which pays absolutely no attention to any comfort factors. In SPORT PLUS, all filter functions are deactivated and the engine responds directly to movements of the accelerator pedal  but this also requires someone behind the wheel who really knows what he is doing. In SPORT PLUS, everything is transmitted as sharply as a knife, in terms of what the engineering can do to facilitate fast lap times  whether in the engine, transmission, chassis or control systems.\n\nhaha no.Sport+ doesn't have an \"unfiltered\" throttle mapping. It's load request tables are definitely way more aggressive. Personally I have my car mapped to use \"sport\" throttle tables in sport+ mode. Much easier to drive with 6MT and feels way more natural.Tell me.. how does 11% request @ 5% throttle = linear? Nonetheless 100% at 85%?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I come from the COBB world and AccessTuner software with all available tables was amazing.\n\n\n\nI'd recommend VF for your OBD flashing choice.BM3 still offers their \"switching program\" that is a nice feature for the DIY owner.But if you just want it tuned and don't have to worry about it then VF, BPM, Mission, RK Tunes..they are all proven legit tuners.\n\nI am running just an OTS map from BM3 also for now at least. Its set it and forget it as you want it and gives you lots of flexibility over others that are just preset tunes. I also love the fact I can sell it and get some money back on it when I decide to change cars which I do every year or two.\n\nI just flashed my ECU from HCP Stage 2. Halim is a great guy that I would recommend everyone. Lightning fast communication. My car is approx. 5-6 car length faster than the stock M2. Very easy to do at home with your laptop.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey guys, I know there are threads on just the Fabspeed Sport Cat, Just the M Performance Exhaust, and also a combination of the two..I was hoping I could get people who have experience with each single modification to comment on the type of sound (and performance gains, Fabsppeed advertised approx. 16Hp; 40 lb of Torque gains) of both and which you think I should get if I had to choose one. I don't know if I want to spend the money to get both of them (3000),Pretty much I can get the Fabspeed for about a grand, and the MPE for a little under 2k including tips (Cyba)Pros for Fabspeed:1. Half the price2. Actual claimed performance gainsPros for MPE1. Actual BMW part (good sound? no performance gains)\n\nWhere are you getting the Fabspeed for 950?\n\nThe Mperformance sounds raw and deep. Add downpipe for loudness and more sound at higher rpm.Tomorrow my Akra sportcat will be installed on my Mperformance exhaust\n\n\n\nI'll just leave this here:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1432744\n\n\n\n\n\nMPE looks fast; Fabspeed DP is fast... and sounds good too.\n\nWill I loss warranty if replacing downpipe?\n\nLet's compare two completely different things that serve different purposes...\n\nIf I had to chose one I would go with the sport cat for power and sound. I have the MPE with CF tips and love it, I'm just waiting for the break in service to be done then I will be adding the sport cat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIm am having the FabSpeed SportCat installed this week, and have some Cyba tips on order. If I need more sound Ill upgrade the cat-back, but Ill probably go with something nicer than the MPE like the Remus. Overall, Im pretty sure the sport cat is going to be enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso consider the following:- if you plan to add a tune in the future, the DP is a no-brainer- aside the the added power, DP improves throttle response- MPE install requires cutting the stock exhaust.  To return to stock, it would require at least adding a sleeve to reconnect the cutting point- I dont have first hand knowledge whether Cyba tips fit MPE but I know this:  Cyba tips fit stock exhaust; MPE tips do not fit stock exhaust.  You could be looking at a $3000 full MPE unit when said and doneThe only argument for MPE over DP is if you are super environmentally conscious.  I chose a Fabspeed Sport DP over a catless for that reason... sort of a happy medium.  And, oh yes, do I ever enjoy the throaty burbling on down shifts!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have MPE and Akrapovic sportcat 300cell.What a difference with the downpipe! Loud downshifts, pops, bangs, burbles, erverything. Much deeper and raw sound. With valves closed no drone. Perfect!\n\nI have recently contemplated this a bit and decided the Fabspeed Sport Cat is the path for me.  I will probably do a VF Engineering Tune at some point so a good downpipe is essential to get the most out of that or just about any tune and I like the fact that I will get a sound improvement and performance improvement from a downpipe.  While I like the sound of the MPE, Remus exhaust and others I simply don't think they offer a very good return on investment, sound is important but not that important and really the M2 is not a bad sounding car as it sits from the factory.  Then again maybe I am just getting old.",

Did you ask Aaron if he has tuned any M2's?\n\n\n\n\n\nFactoryFreak M2 lol, definitely the highest Dyno on stock M2/92 octane usually these numbers are seen with cars that have Catless DP and 93 octane. But hey doesn't matter as long you use the same Dynojet for Delta and go after your mods who cares of the number if it makes low or high at the end of the day lol. This proves every car is different once again.If you can ask for your DRF files (Dynorun file) you can or I can load it up for you on WinPep8 software (free) on computer so you can upload a better viewing, online version of the graph.Thanks for posting\n\nwell WHP wise your results are not far off from what I got.

Thinking I might head to English for a baseline also.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I agree withFSociety354whp seems a bit high. It is about the delta gains if you are curious how much more you are going to gainafter the modsare installed. State side the norm seem to be 340-345whp on 93 octane. Either way I am glad you are not keeping it stock\n\nThanks guys. We will have to see what happens.I have my buddy a ride in it yesterday and he just got back from some dyno running with his wrx. He made 410 whp and 395 ft lbs... and he was telling me that my car feels a lot faster than his even though he made better numbers.I'm happy with the car, and maybe with these other few upgrades I have yet to install I'll make some better numbers.I'll keep everyone posted.",

I had the Active Autoworke intake charge pipe installed when I purchased my new 2017 M2, after i had a factory charge pipe gasket failure at the race track with my 2015 M235i.  My M2 performed flawlessly recently at Sebring raceway, except for the tube with the MAF that connects from intake pipe to charge pipe started popping off.  This lead to multiple MAF related code errors and car limping off of the track.  Once i reconnected the tube and reset the codes, everything went back to normal except during the drive home when tube popps off again from full throttle acceleration.   Attached are photos to show what is happening.  Does anyone run an aftermarket connecting tube, or have an aftermarket connector that works for them ?

Want to know your opinion on it.Claims to say that it has proven gains.I'm not gonna do this btw I just want you take on it\n\nAbsolutely not\n\n\n\nZero proof that it actually improves performance...and at the risk of destroying the OEM catRemanufactured Cat is $1200-1600Not worth the risk to me...I have no idea how'd take this apart to remove the rear section...and why that would improve flow enough like a 200-300 racecat...\n\nIt's an expensive piece of equipment to replace if you screw it up, and chances are you will. I never heard of someone gutting half a cat. Just get a downpipe with a high flow cat (fabspeed comes to mind) if you want more sound/power and still somewhat care about the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfuck no lol, quite possibly the dumbest “mod” HAHAI can see how one would do this \"mod\" (this is how the guy preaching about this \"mod\" did it), if you look at your OEM downpipe, the 2nd O2 sensor is between two separate cats, there's a space between them. So, I think if you enter from the catback side of the downpipe, you can basically break apart that second cat and you'll be left with the first cat before the 2nd O2 sensor and after the 1st O2 sensor.I think the cat this individual removed is a different cell count than the first cat between the O2 sensors. Not sure if the following cell count is correct, but the cat he removed is 200 cell, leaving the 400 cell one in.I have no idea if a CEL will show up, but theoretically it shouldn't because the 2nd O2 sensor (which checks for efficiency) is after the 1st cat.But in NO WAY would this \"mod\" be equal or better than buying a 200 cell catted downpipe or of course catless. This individual also attacks other vendors that are trying to sell a proven product such as the Fabspeed Catted downpipe. I'm catless btw LOL.No one should attempt this \"mod\" as others have already said, many reasons as to why it's a stupid idea.I'm really interested if this individual is running a \"stage 2\" tune on his car with his gutted downpipe? Wouldn't that create a lot of extra heat and have too much back pressure than what the map is made for (most common cell count of 200 or catless)?\n\n^ yup\n\nI wouldnt do it...but i would cut springs tho lolJust not on the m2.Maybe if I was still in my rice days.I refuse to buy products without a dyno\n\nCirca 1997-2000 ( cutting springs)\n\nSo where is this thread where someone decided to gut their cat??\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho...1457649&page=2\n\nNo. This is not an '83 camaro.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "On September 2017, I walked into the dealership and ordered a New M2. I got an Allocation for it and was promised the car will be here on November, the car came  in December. It was time to pick up the M2.I took really great care of the car, during break in period the car ran fine no CEL or anything. I never revved the car, or even pass 3500 rpms and stayed below 75mph. NEVER was it in Sport or Sport Plus.400 miles later after my break in period, I get in the car and a CEL turned on. I called the dealer and made an appointment immediately.The invoice saysAt 1931 miles- \"1931 connect vehicle run short test misfire cylinder 4,5, and 6. Run test plan run procedure for spark plug test, continue thru test plan, had to connect fan simulator to rapidly cool engine off to complete test plan. Connect smoke machine smoke test engine no leaks found. No faults found DIAG CODE D110_B0000000_72_901. Speak with shop Forman, as per shop Forman swap plugs and coils from cylinders 1 to, 2 and 3 to 4,5 and 6. Clear fault memory road test vehicle. Return vehicle to customer to drive and see if fault returns.\"Now I have 2805 miles and I turned my car and guess what ANOTHER CEL. Now I have till Monday since the service center is closed.MY CAR IS COMPLETELY STOCK.WHATs GOING ON? DO I HAVE A LEMON?\n\nFirst thing is not to overreact. Give them a chance to figure out what's going on. Sometimes these things take time and multiple visits, it's not magic. If you don't think they are addressing your issue properly take it to a different dealership. It's premature to say you have a lemon right now. That said, document everything. How long the issue has persisted, dates you took it in for service, how long it was in the shop etc. Keep copies of all invoices/receipts related to this issue.\n\n\n\nYou didn't break it in. Not saying you totally babying the car has anything to do with your issues, but I personally can't think of anything worse to do to a car engine than what you did. Wait, driving it hard before warming it up. That would be worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree withdoug_999on break in procedure.  The first few hundred miles perhaps go easy but you should hammer on the car to break it in the same way you drive it normally.Either way.    Weak or strong Break in aside that's not your issue here.I'm concerned by this-\"  Run test plan run procedure for spark plug test, continue thru test plan, had to connect fan simulator to rapidly cool engine off to complete test plan.\"Had to connect fan simulator.  ?  That sounds like the motor was overheating or misfiring for their test.While the issue still could just be poor ignition coils or  can sensor or something minor it's a little odd that they swapped the items but apparently didn't road test it ?   Did they even drive it after they \" fixed it \".They should have at least driven it 5-10 miles.  They don't need to go FIFTY miles ...Your car isn't a \" lemon\" ( by any sense this early on ) But it may have an issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wouldn't worry too much, it is a pain to have an issue like this but the tech will send in the data to New Jersey for some advanced analysis and they will pin down the issue this time.  i would argue they should have done that in the first place but they often don't seem to do that.  Your car is covered under warranty and I am sure you state has a lemon law but I doubt you will have this issue past the next visit.Years ago I had a bizarre series of error codes on my E90 3 series, they had the car for a day and said the car was fine it needed a new battery, fast forward a week and the same thing happened (only triggered over 80mph for sustained periods of time) this time they kept the car for several days and sent the data to NJ and their analysis of the same data showed it needed a new rear wheel bearing of all things, they changed is and the car didn't have an issue for the remaining 175,000 miles I drove it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a reason why the techs moved the plugs and coil packs around. These guys know what they are doing. Now with a second CEL they will be able to diagnose further and pinpoint the issue.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi guys,I have my MY18 with MPE + Fabspeed Sport Cat DP combo and I love it so far without any issue.I was just one day browsing internet and found some website involving ppl going against Fabspeed for lawsuit (group i think) because of their damaged car after running with some Fabspeed products... (not sure what product exactly causing the issue)http://www.fabspeedsucks.com/Now starting to worry if I did the right thing or not... Wondering if I should go and change my DP to Akrapovic...??Anyone knows about this subject in detail??\n\nI can assure you that it doesn't matter what downpipe is on your car, it will not 'break' anything. The only thing that could happen is the catalyst in the downpipe fails and you have some rattling and smell.Switching to another brand won't be any 'safer'. The exhaust part only increases or decreases flow. Unless it was substantially smaller, or super restriction (neither of which are of concern in this scenario), there will not be anything that could cause a mechanical failure with the operation of the vehicle.Edit: Basically, if its on the car, and the fitment is fine, then you are safe. Worst case scenario is that your cat fails. Which I doubt, because they claim to be using HJS cats.\n\n\n\n\n\nwould love ifFabspeed Motorsportwould comment on this\n\nIf a lawsuit has been filed, they won't (or at least shouldn't) comment while it's pending.Maybe some of their other products have issues, or their business practices/customer service isn't the best, but there's near consensus that their sport cat is THE downpipe to get if you want to avoid a CEL. I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nHere's the deal with Fabspeed.  Their products are generally very good.  You said yourself you have it and love it and have no issues.  That's been the experience for most of us.  ANY company that manufacture a product will have the occasional defect, Fabspeed included.  it's how you handle customer service in the face of addressing those defects that matters.  This is where Fabspeed stumbled in the past.  There are some pretty heated threads here in you dig far enough back, where Fabspeed was not holding up their end of the deal, missing delivery commitments, giving out bad timelines for shipments, etc.  Their front line customer service people really do care and do the very best they can, but were often prevented from providing good customer service by the fabspeed upper management falling back on fine print and creative interpretation of the warranty.  In the end, I believe Fabspeed corrected the issues they were having and are back on track.Would I say that should you ever have a problem, Fabspeed will be there to have your back no matter what like Dinan does?  No.  Definitely not.  But again, their product is solid, aside from the occasional slip up in manufacturing or QC that any company has.  Your catted DP is going to give you zero problems.  If you were going to have problems you would have already had them so rest easy and enjoy it.In the end, I would buy my catted DP all over again.  It's that good.  For any of you considering the purchase, my recommendation would be to buy your Fabspeed catted DP from a Fabspeed vendor like Mike and XPH.  You can easily find him here on the forum.  He keeps them in stock, same price as Fabspeed direct I believe, and by buying through Mike you eliminate any supply chain issues/delays that you might experience in buying direct from Fabspeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical Ferrari owner",

    "content": "After driving a couple other cars over the past few weeks a question has crossed my mind. Why do BMW manual transmissions have such a bizarre, unrewarding feel? Do they make them comfortable so the old man with elbow issues can still enjoy it with out discomfort? Is it a lack of care from the Bavarian's who make the car? Is this a way of pushing people towards DCT? Cost cuttings? My E92 was mushy, and my M2 is soft and unnoticeable. Only giving me the sensory stimulus once in a while. I drove an E36 M3 (whose clutch left my calf exhausted) , and that was good, but that was also the BMW of 20 years ago.I drove a GT350 a couple weeks ago, and the TREMEC 6 speed unit felt like working the bolt on my Grandpas old Lee Enfield. But even more surprising is the shift feel in my 2015 STi. Simply makes you smile, rowing the gears. And that car is a POS, already rattling with 14000km.I know there is different SS kits available, but all of them seem to have issues with apparent customer dissatisfaction, at least around here that is.So I thought I'd open the discussion on what everyone's take is on this\n\nI had E46 M3 MT and now M2. Shifter feel remains the same. It's a BMW thing.\n\nI have an M235 but it has the same tranny and shifter.  I also had a 2012 WRX which used the same direct shift linkage as the 6MT STI.  What you need to consider here is it's a German car and they go to great lengths to reduce NVH.  Such care is not used by Subaru or Ford.  The TREMEC is great, but it also has a lot of vibration, notchiness, and stiffness.  Same goes for the Subaru direct linkage shifters.  When you reduce NVH, you typically mute some of the feel.  That's what happens with the 6MT in your M2.  I've owned and driven a lot of manuals over the years and find the 6MT in my M235 to be quite nice for a daily driven manual.  As the tranny has broken in, the shift feel is smooth, pretty direct, robust feeling, and not overly notchy.  I also swapped out the stock shift knob for the smaller M Performance shift knob.  The smaller knob along with the lack on insulating material on the knob results in more directness, better shift feel, more shift weight, and a slightly reduced throw (shorter and narrower knob = reduced lever throw).  I'm quite happy with the change it made.  I'd never go back to the stock shift knob.If you like the shifter in the GT350 or STI and don't care about increased NVH, you'd probably be quite happy with one of the aftermarket shifters available for the M2.My biggest gripe with the 6MT is the clutch pedal weight and take up during normal driving.  The clutch pedal is light and somewhat numb thus I find it difficult to feel the catch point.  The clutch pedal also has an excessive throw and it's resting point is 1\" above the brake pedal.  A clutch stop helps take out some of the travel on the lower end of the pedal travel, but does nothing to improve the weight, gauging the catch point, and pedal resting point.  All these factors compound to create a somewhat difficult manual to drive smoothly.  During hard driving and launching the car, I have no issues.   The Ultimate Clutch Pedal is high on my mod list (reduce pedal throw, more pedal weight).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou guys don't realize how muchbetterthis transmission is than some of the other performance cars on the market. I had a 2012 TTRS and it was horrible. Gate spacing was so close together it was super-easy to moneyshift, and the action was very rubbery and vague (cable-actuated). Clutch was heavy as hell and impossible to find the actual bite point.In comparison, the BMW has been absolutely wonderful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwning a 1994 NSX and don't think the shift is that great. Perfect short throw but too stiff. Car has 70k miles so perhaps not fully broken in yetTry the AZ6 box found in the RX8, MX5, Altezza etc =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "OBD unlock is in testing and we'll have more details to share soon. Short answer is anyone looking to go the OBD unlock route instead of bench flash will be able to do so at home or at any of our supporting dealer locations.Unlocking over OBD does not perform a full readout like unlocking on bench does. Currently the only way to fully restore any given DME back to full stock software including flash counters is still via open/bench flash and for that reason we'll be offering both options still to end users depending on their needs.There are a few more cool features on the horizon very soon but we felt this one needed to be announced first. Everyone's doing it!\n\ni was actually thinking when you would be doing this. lol when can we expect it to be ready? i've been holding out for something like this\n\nCoupled with the end user tuning editor this is pretty cool.

Hope this is some of the cool features on the horizon.. hint hintKeep up the awesome progress..\n\nThanks for being upfront about the flash back to stock...... I don't remember VF/Hex stating that issue\n\nDo you have a time frame?  There are tons of people anxiously awaiting this.\n\nAny estimate on when it will be available?\n\n\n\nThread jack/thread\n\nCopy n Pasting what they wrote on F80's threadHey guys, really sorry for lack of updates here as most of our staff is away until Jan. 2nd and we're trying our best given the holidays.BM3 OBD unlock is coming very soon. While away on non-stop 15 hour flights we've managed to kill lots of time by expanding our DME Read feature that's part of the Diagnostics screen. It hasn't yet been pushed out as we don't want to break something unexpectedly until we're fully staffed again come week of Jan. 2nd. If you've followed our updates through the initial BM3 release back in late 2015 early 2016 you'd know that given how most of this work reverse engineering, sometimes days go by without making much progress, and then, in just a few hours or even a few minutes at times, a glimpse of a solution shows itself which ends up unfolding itself into a new solution/feature or even a change to the approach on how something is done so it could be improved upon.Current tools/cables released that have OBD unlock support already such as Magic Motorsports, Frieling (many vendors that announced OBD unlock on this forum use this tool provider), CMD, can produce full 4MB readout files that can be used to activate and run with BM3. BM3's DME read feature that has been expanded recently will provide those already unlocked by some tuner out there (regardless of method) an easy way to activate without pulling the DME again as well which will make it super easy to get on board with it, get custom tuned and use anything in BM3 you'd like.More to follow very soon...http://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho...7&postcount=89\n\nSubscribed\n\nAny update?  BM3 is my first choice but they are very late to the party.\n\n+1 for MHD. HC Performance is already a great option for OBD flashing.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comHey guys,The M2 PURE Stage2 Upgrade is Now Available!!!The M2 is very similar to the non-M N55 turbos, but there is a few small changes. Our M2 turbo does run a different compressor wheel and a different DV+. More on that later.The M2 is a blast to drive. The transmission is crisp and it handles phenomenally. It begs to be driven hard. With 500whp now on tap, it's tough to ask for anything more out of this little blue beast!We had some fun testing on the dyno today! Brand new M2 with the following mods:-M2 PURE Stage2 Turbo Upgrade-M2 PURE HiFlow Inlet Pipe-BMS JB4 w/ EWG connector-BMS Intake kit-Fuel-It New Low Profile Port Injection System-Fuel-It Stage2 LPFP-Fuel-It Ethanol content sensor, with JB4 input!-Evolution Racewerks CP-Evolution Racewerks DP-Wagner FMIC-E47 Fuel (50/50 91oct/e85)\n\nThis car is so much fun to drive! Nice work Jesse I can't recommend your shop enough.\n\nWow? DCT or MT?\n\nAwesome!\n\nCosts??\n\nImpressive !I'm not sure if this has been covered but I'd be interested to know if it's possible just to have an upgraded turbo with a flash tune without JB4 running normal pump gas between 91+93 octane.I'm not interested in ethanol mixes or meth.If so, what sort of power @ psi would this yield.Thanks.\n\nWhy do the upper curves have huge dips in them?\n\nLooking at the curves the tune definitely needs some more work...would like to see this with ethanol above 80%!Needs a TTFS Flash Tune!\n\nThe the m235 ER DP, and cp fits?!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhoa....\n\nWhy E47?\n\n\n\n\n\nPure sex.\n\nI wonder how drive able this would be on track lol\n\nGood job!\n\nEpic!\n\nI wonder how the DCT transmission is gonna hold up with 500+whp. The 335is dct seems to start slipping right past the 500whp+ mark\n\nPatiently waiting for 340 love.....\n\nAwesome numbers! I bet this thing is a pure animal to drive!",

My M2 arrives in December.\n\n\n\nI have the LCI with the stock exhaust. I'd say there aren't really any \"bangs\". You still have little pops and crackles though which sound great. Traction mode still works. Looking forward to the M Performance exhaust though.\n\nI have an early my'17 EU spec and now with the latest firmware (my'18) installed.The car keeps on burbling in Traction and Sport+ but much LESS loudly than before. Pops now are almost disappeared (even though the HJS 300 + Remus catback).It's a shame for my ears but the whole engine management seems better refined.\n\n\n\n\n\nI got my 18 LCI US on the 24th of September The exhaust sounds great much deeper than my 235. But when I took the cat out of the 235 it sounded pure awesome. Pops & bangs were much more pronounced. I can't wait to get the cat out of the 2 it should be real impressive except when I start it, my neighbors are not fans at all. That's the only comparo I can give you I have to find someone else with a 16 or 17 to compare to mine.\n\nMy friend has a week 28 LCI and it pops a lot and bangs occasionally in \"Traction mode\"\n\nIt should backfire when you WOT from 4,000 - 4,800 and then let off throttle.Make sure you Don't go over 4,800. All BMW M cars I believe are programmed like this, alongside no burbles over 5,000 RPM. as the DCT starts to 'fart' past 5,000.For the backfire, you must be in sport/sports+\n\n\n\n\n\nis this not indicative of a leaky exhaust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Trying to figure out which exhaust is best for performance but is also good with controls\n\nAkra and Armytrix are both dual exhausts I believe. I can imagine the dual exhaust on the m2 is as good as It gets. They both sound pretty good too\n\nNo exhaust on this car is going to give you a significant power increase from stock levels, unless it includes a less-restrictive downpipe (which can be bought separately, though some exhausts like the Akra - can be bought together with DP).I have the Fabspeed sport cat DP, and it provides some power & great sound.  Catless DP’s will add a *little* bit more power yet if you’re willing to find a solution (e.g. tune) to avoid a CEL, and if you’re OK with stinky exhaust.\n\nNo exhaust will give you any noticeable performance gains.My favorite is REMUS or Active Autowerke exhaust\n\nWhy does nobody recommend the M Performance exhaust? Cuz they claim no performance gains? Cuz it is a BMW part and not sold by the aftermarket vendors?I cannot see how it does not add something, it is a free flow design and deletes the mid pipe resonator. Oh and I looked thru the stock resonator and it is a big open hole with a baffle around it. I just think BMW down plays the gains of the MPE...it sounds amazing... not Joe Ricer loud but a deep aggressive business growlI just installed it on my '18 and was afraid it would be supper hot rod loud but i am really pleased with the sound levels and overall tone.\n\n\n\nGood point..... the cost for me was a bargain. Getting it from Brian and i already had tips that in its self made it a bias decision...I got a great sounding exhaust for 1615 and some install labor on my part. If i had to buy the carbon tips it would have put the exhaust at aprox 2500+ give or takeBut I see Akra being thrown around and is it not at there tune of around 6k retail? Hummmmm\n\n\n\nIts personal preference, I think akra and FI sound good but have a lot of \"bark\" if the car isnt tuned or personalized to match the crazy sound.I bought a Dinan exhaust and mid pipe, it sounds amazing. From a sound perspective, I think its perfect.That being said, exhausts dont really add horsepower, I kinda wish would have gotten a down pipe to begin with and see how that sounded. Because now I want to get a one, and combining a down pipe with a dinan exhaust is crazy loud and there is now valve control.\n\nIMHO for performance gains sport cat is where its at.  No real gains in exhaust until you upgrade turbos etc.  The active Autowerkes system is 3.5 tubing (stock is 3-3.2) so it should be less restrictive and valve the bypasses the muffler.  However, Im not too sure about tubing sizes of other systems.\n\nBought the DINAN with the resonator delete and the FABSPEED catted downpipe frommike@x-ph.comafter for an great deal @ Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the great deal Mike!Still patiently waiting for the FABSPEED to be delivered to install everything at one time.Should sound awesome\n\n\n\nA BMW sales rep tried to tell me the MPE added 15hp , likely because he was trying to sway me from ordering a MT and instead buy the overpriced DCT they had on the floor with the MPE. He quickly lost my business as I ordered a MT from their sister dealership and waited two months for the car. Sooo glad I got the MT.",

The startup has a noticeable stumble before it goes to higher revs. It's pretty rare, but has happened probably 5 times or so in 13 months.\n\nLet the fuel pump prime abit before doing cold start.

    "content": "An intercooler upgrade on your BMW N55 turbocharged engine will dramatically improve performance on and off the track. The N55 engine as featured in popular F Series cars such as the M235i, M2, 335i, and 435i can make a lot of horsepower with basic mods such as tune and exhaust. With this increase in power, it is difficult for the stock intercooler to keep temperatures down and the turbo running at maximum efficiency. The new Agency Power intercooler features a step design to maximize space required in the already narrow bumper area. With an increase in size and a change in volume, a larger intercooler will decrease temperatures up to 40 degrees and add nearly 20 horsepower on modified cars compared to the stock core.The intercooler is a bar and plate design for maximum efficiency. It features high flow cast end tanks which are TIG welded. Each end tank features precision CNC machined hose fittings to work with the factory intercooler hoses. The installation is extremely easy as this is a direct replacement. Intercoolers are available in a stealth black finish.Fitment:BMW F30 F32 328i 335i 428i 435iBMW F22 F87 228i M235i M2\n\nYet another hp claim and no data to back it up.

It's a small high speed GPS device that interfaces with your phone or mobile device via BlueTooth and allows you to accurately compute performance metrics like 0-60, 1/4 mile & trap speed, 60-130mph, 100-200kmh, etc. The resulting run files compute and validate slope, and spit out in a little graphic ready to analyze, share, etc.You charge it using a mini-USB port, with the charge lasting a few days (it only wakes up when connected to app), and then throw it on the dash and open the app when you want to start recording runs. It's magnetic so there are slicker mounting options available, but I haven't found them necessary on our test cars. I just throw it up in the corner of the windshield.We tested them at the latest Shift Sector and No Fly Zone 1/2 mile events and were very pleased with the accuracy and flexibility of the system. A few screen shots from my testing below.There are a few thousand in use in Asia with great success and we're helping introduce it to the English speaking market. The free Dragy app will be posted to the play store and apple store within a few days. If you happen to get the device before the app is posted just email us and we can send a link for it.Anyway much more info to follow, including their app based tuner leader board and other slick features, but I know you guys are going to love this thing.Wanted to make a comparison video but right now its Dragy 1, VBOX 0\n\nThis is great!Now everyone has no excuse if they cant access a Dyno haha\n\nShit i might have to get one of these....any use other than start to stop timing?\n\nCompare this vs vbox vs timing lights at a drag strip.\n\nIm curious what the cost would be!\n\n\n\nHopefully this gets more people into gps testing with its lower price over a vbox.Lets see some n55 bm3 and other flash tune results!\n\n\n\npm price please\n\n\n\npm price here\n\n\n\nHope is not too late going to ask Santa Claus for this for Christmas.\n\n\n\nGot mine today.

I do this with all systems off (long press TC button) btw.\n\nNo issues here but I also dont use the UCP and or the clutch stop. Ive found the transmission moves a bit under certain loads and it will cause the clutch to bite differently. I can feel a bit of clutch drag in the Tranny sometimes.\n\nIt's because the difference in gear ratio is so high between 1-2, and you get a massive torque boost at the same time.\n\nDo you have a clutch stop installed?",

Is the BMW OEM any good?Also, is the M2 battery Li-ion?Thanks for your help!\n\nGot the answer from my local dealer service department.The M2 can use any AGM battery charger 2A/5A/15A automatic (also good for lead batteries).\n\nHow about a ctek 4.3 test and charger? I think BMW sells just the standard 4.3.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've always used these on my BMW's without issue:https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Tende...battery+tender\n\nAs long as you don't have lithium ion you can pretty use any charger/maintainer.  There is a specific one BMW has for the LI batteries.\n\nSo the m2 has a lead acid battery. Only the m3/m4 have the new lithium battery?\n\n\n\nLets say you look to see what type of battery you have what is one way to tell the type of battery? I don't think the battery simply is labeled lead acid.\n\nIf it's an LI battery is says it right on the top.\n\nAlways go CTEK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know if there would be a huge problem setting the charger to either the agm mode versus just using the normal mode for the m2? I know that agm provides slightly more voltage output.\n\nWhat mode do you set the CTEK on for extended storage? I read the instruction manual, but I am not sure.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "So seems like a lame question but when does the stock exhaust valve actually operate? LCI and mine seems to be open all the time. It does not close on cold start like the F80/82 does....and when it warms up it is still open (sorry). Does it only operate while under load?Maybe mine came faulty and always open\n\n\n\nFrom the technical specs:Hope this helps!\n\nBased on the above mine is inoperable..... I am not sure when it closes but for sure it is open on cold start when it shouldn't be.So far it seems mine is fully open at cold start and if you switch to comfort it stays open at idle. I can never hear it move...... I will wait till my 1200 mile service then ask but I really don't give 2 cents since I am going to install the MPE sometime soon. It just seemed add and makes me think something else is wrongIt is not really loud compared to my M4 but was surprised after 700 mi the one side tips are not getting black and i noticed I can't hear much difference between comfort and sport and flap does not make the usual sound when switching at idle so I checked it out\n\nI tried a valve controller with the stock exhaust and catless downpipe, valves open or closed the difference is VERY minimal. Compared to my Akrapovic, which will be LOUD open and QUIETER than stock closed haha. I think due the design of the stock exhaust, the valve effectiveness is minimal. So you may think its open all the time, when in reality it may be opening and closing. From my own testing, start up its open and under load itll open up, its mainly closed in comfort mode until under load. In Sport/Sport+ it might stay open and then eventually close and opens always under load. Honestly I dont understand how the stock valve operation works it seems random, which is why I highly recommend using a valve controller! Also, I noticed the F80/82 cars when the valves are closed it actually gets quiet and when open it gets loud, whereas our car as I mentioned open/closed there really isnt a difference. But on an aftermarket exhaust the difference is huge, exactly how youd expect it to be! Im sure your car is fine! Also, the comfort/sport switch will not open or close the valves in idle, occasionally it might if the car is warmed up but the driving modes do not directly open/close valves on demand like a valve controller will.\n\nI might have been way off base assuming it functioned the same as my F82 but it does not.You explanation makes sense though",

All the dct threads are related to the older models with dct's, which brings me here. I am a prospective m2 buyer but would buy it in a dct. Has bmw done anything to improve this tranny in the last 5 years? Has the m2 dct been reliable ?\n\nI believe m2 has the gen 3, most likely the last gen of it.Gen 1 E9X MY2008-2010Gen 2 E9X MY2011-MY2013Gen 3 F8X MY2014-todayNo issues though. I never drove a gen 1 (I heard it's much jerkier). But comparing my m2 to e90 m3, I confirm gen3 is noticeably smoother, though it still gives you jerkiness in stop and go traffic, by sometimes not upshifting into 2nd gear even in comfort mode when should. You've got to get familiar with its behavior and when needed, work your throttle \"tricking\" it into upshifting, or simply manually does it.\n\nI would check the reliability of the DCT in the f80 forums to see if gen 3 is likely to have issues.  There have not been many posts (any at all?) on the M2 boards about a DCT issues, but the car is still pretty new.  Maybe someone had fluid leaking?  I can't recall anyone having major issues.\n\nI just did a search on the F80 boards for DCT and clicked on every thread on the first two pages that have DCT in the title and a complaint.Basically it was a bunch of \"is it normal to hear this clunk sound\" and \"is it normal for it to be jerky 1-2\" or similar.  Then there were a couple DCT overheated once and went limp mode but never happened again, and the DCT stalled on me going quickly from R to D.That's pretty much what I found, no major issues in my search for f8x cars.\n\nI think they’re pretty solid in our cars.My uncle has a Gen 1 and it definitely shifts slower and not as smooth or precise feeling. Also overheats on track, but he’s pushing 640hp with an ESS supercharger and other add ons.\n\nThe DCT in the M2 is an amazing transmission, enjoy it.",

Cradle for your NOs bottle.\n\n\n\nA 4.5'-in-3'-out downpipe it looks to me.AA has always been a creative player. They already have 4-3.5 downpipe for EWG N55 that only fits AA cat back. But a 4.5-3 opens the market for standard 3' catback.I like it. I'm in if they put in high quality HJS cats as option.I believe bigger downpipe (either 4-3.5 or 4.5-3, over standard 4-3) reduce backpressue, helps spool and makes power. Best sample look at r35 GTR transit from CBA to DBA in MY2012. The key change is the enlarging of turbo outlet and downpipe inlet.Result varies from platform to platform though. Hope AA come out with something that's dyno proven, solidly.BTW, that's only if I was not guessing wrong.\n\nSeanWRTvery close.It is a catted downpipe that will not throw any CEL code\n\nWow, another catted down pipe.

    "content": "Just got in my Dinan Big Turbo and Wagner IC.  Still deciding on whether I go with a catless or catted DPs.  Big question is ECU.Bootmod3 - sounds like the best option, but I hear it's irreversible and completely voids the car warranty.JB4 - I'm really scared of the reliability here. I've had mostly good past experiences with my 335i, M3 and a really bad experience with my 328i.  Ended up ruining my 328i ECU.  So I'm really reluctant now.Dinantronics Stage 4 - expensive and doesn't really give me much power.  Build quality seems superb though.Any other suggestion?\n\nA good friend just informed me about a new way to tune Fxx cars today after getting a email from this company, Im going to do more research tomorrow.A solution that doesnt require unlocking ECU to read write through OBD. I might be a guinea pig if he decides to buy the software.https://www.autotuner-tool.com/en/bmwobd\n\nVF engineering looked promising on paper when I looked into itAny flash tune will void your warranty though\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOP you don't really have that many flash tuning options. Removing ECU or not, you need a custom tune for bigger turbo. That alone narrows your choices down to either a local bench tuner or BM3 remote tuning via datalog.I have been datalogging my car for quite a while with DzenanproTUNING Freaksand HalimHalim@HCP. Things I have realized, they keep improving their files from data feedback from its user base, a thing that few others in the industry can match. Where they're right now, I think it's a difficult job for you to find better tuners for F platform in the business.\n\nBM3 FTW hahaahah\n\n+1 custom tune via bootmod3\n\nManic Motorsport (the most famous Mini ECU tuner in EU) is close to officially release a Stage 1 map for the M2. Got a buddy that is running the beta version on his M2 and it works great. Anyway unlocking ecu is needed.\n\nAuto tuner is a professional solution, you'll still need a A2L and FR, as well as WinOLS.  Definitely not an option for someone that wants to do their own tuning unless you want to learn how the professionals do it, reading through 15,000 pages that are in german is fun...BM3 is probably the best option, and port flashing should be coming soon from what I've heard.\n\n\n\nBPM prices out...http://www.bpmsport.com/services/tun...7-m2-tune.html\n\nJust heard back from Mike Radowski over at Bimmer Clinic and he officially has an OBD Port Flashing solution for the M2.  More details coming soon.\n\nPTF just announcedhttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1447623\n\nRK Tunes just released a plug and play tuner that is reversible minus flash counter. It will only show a +1 on the counter but no signs of any data changes.\n\nBM3 FTW\n\nThey are all coming out of the cracks......\n\nGet a HEX tune. Nothing more to say.\n\nIt would be pretty helpful to have a spreadsheet or a table comparing the tunes.  The Stage 1 advertised hp and torque differences between the hex and bmp3, for example, are huge.  Also, some of the companies offer different tunes for 91 vs 93 octane as well as other features.  Seems like there have been at least five self-installed tunes to hit the market in the last several weeks.So a comparison table would be a great addition to this discussion.  I don't want to start flame wars, but seeing the stats and features side by side would lend clarity and focus the discussion.  And I'm sure folks with experience with these tuners could add insight on tradeoffs between, say, additional hp vs smoothness.  I wouldn't know how to embed a table into one of these posts.  It might even be worth a new tread.  I know I'd be watching.",

    "content": "I'm currently waiting on delivery for my MY18 M2 (October), and I've read quite a bit about much of the common issues, quirks and things to pay attention to. I'm noticing that a lot of the limitations come down to fueling, and potentially the HPFP not being up to snuff for anything much beyond the limitations of the factory turbo. As with other platforms that have HPFP limitations, the aftermarket has come with revised/upgraded units to fill the gap. Has any of the major companies, especially the tuners, looked into exactly which part of the fuel system is the weak link? If in fact it is the HPFP, are there any plans in the works for an upgraded unit?I know that I don't even have the car yet, and this is purely from a point of looking at the tuning headroom to work with later on down the road should I decide to go that route, but I like to know what I'm working with a little bit. It's a fairly new platform, but I feel ~2 years is an adequate amount of time to be able to find common mechanical limitations on ancillary parts. Thanks in advance guys.\n\nHPFP is pretty well known to be the bottleneck for fueling on the N55.  The only real solutions on offer today are supplemental fueling via meth, throttle body injection, or port injection.  No one offers an upgraded HPFP worth considering.The S55 uses a double, parallel HPFP setup, but no one is working on adapting that to the N55, because port injection is cheaper (for the end user) and more profitable (for the tuners).\n\nTo my knowledge, for n55 nobody has ever provided a HPFP upgrade yet, nor is anyone working on it. Most likely nobody ever will. Because of the cost in developing such a thing and selling price being far more than market agrees. These day everybody is chasing cheap horsepower.\n\nI know this is a bit off topic, but I'd like to see an aftermarket intake manifold developed with a second set of fuel injectors, ran to a Walbro in tank pump.  That would likely solve fueling issues.  Managing it though, is a whole different issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's disappointing to hear. Part of the appeal of using DI is because of it's in-cylinder cooling benefits. Resorting to using older, albeit familiar, tech like PI is just a bandaid, not really much of a solution.In other platforms I have seen development for HPFP internals that handle higher loads and are simple internal swap kits for a very fair price point, not exactly an entire replacement. I figured that something would be available considering BMW's in general are more up market anyways, and certainly a healthy enthusiast market. Ah well, gotta work with what you got. Are these entire fuel systems, or are we just talking larger injectors and a higher volume LPFP?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it really that problematic? I am surprised dinan didn't see this as an issue in their p2 kit. I agree hpfp always seems to be a bottleneck. But I am surprised dinan felt the need to not address.\n\n\n\nI sawthison the Dinan website. Thinking it maybe the solution. There is also a hose kit.  I took a road trip to la and found that at a certain speed with jb4 and upgrades the hpfp is definitely the issue. It was disappointing.\n\n\n\nJB4 maps 1 and 2. Akra exhaust, vrsf intercooler, vrsf catless **, removed intake due to pcv code 120E20.  The hpfp kept crashing. Logs were checked out by bms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real main issue on fueling until you get to stupid levels of power is the saddle tank. If you run the car below half a tank with prolonged periods of acceleration, the pump that feeds the saddle (where the pump to send fuel to the motor resides) can't keep up and so you get fuel cuts.People have ran 500WHP without too much issue until you get up to roughly 6500RPM. If your goal is 500WHP, look into a different solution (PI, lpfp, meth, e85, etc.). Otherwise, you should be fine.\n\nOn the Dinan site, they offer a complete pump or just the hose kit for $600 less, which allows you to modify existing HPFP.  Looks like bigger hoses and some other connectors that from the photos looks like they may flow better, IDK",

I didn't get one on my 435i, one of my friends with a 435i also didn't get one, both my friends with M2's also didn't get one.I believe it has something to do with the \"Levant package\" that shows up on E-Sys for all cars. I believe this stops all warnings related to emissions due to the somewhat dodgy fuel quality in Lebanon.All US imported cars get CEL from the gas, so I guess this was BMW's remedy for the region.Check out if you can code it.",

So my question is: is there an easy way to reset adaptations on the F87?  IIRC, you can run a sequence on the e90 by pressing the accelerator to the floor while pressing the start button with you foot OFF the brake or something like that.  Is there something similar with our cars that doesn't involve pulling the battery cable and dealing with the associated drama?  Searched but didn't find it.I commute in traffic and I think it may be dumbing down the curve, like my car thinks I enjoy driving around at 30MPH.  I have Bimmercode and eSys if it involves clearing anything that way.  I want to do the ISTEP thing anyway but would like to have the experience with this ahead of time so I can be a little better educated about any changes when that goes down.  6MT, so not looking for tranny adaptations, just the engine/throttle/etc curve.TIA to anyone who can comment.\n\n\n\nDoes this also reset fuel trims? Would TBA reset show anything noticeable on before and after dyno runs?\n\n\n\nYou could also disconnect the battery?\n\n\n\nThat so called reset has been around for years. No one has ever proven it works.\n\nI ran this and didnt hear anything happening. No difference in throttle response.

A lot has been built already starting with a clean sheet back then with many more updates coming on both the custom tuning feature front for end users as well as tuning.We have support for all software versions of the S55 and most if not all N55 PWG/EWG including M2/X4 M40i. S63tu is very well covered as well as its smaller half, the N20/N26N63tu we've seen the least of so far even though the motor is very capable of great gains and we have some users in closed beta that we're working with when it comes to the ActiveHybrid 3 (N55 PWG).As of today there are2086active users with on average about a 1000 logins and around ~60 signups weekly, screenshot of our user management console below:Since Sept. 7th '17 when we started gathering stats on flashes there have been a total of 3843 flashes.Custom tuning editor and features were introduced on Sept. 17th and since there have been 402 map/tune requests generated.Bootmod3 currently supports custom tuning across 55 software versions across the motors mentioned above with anywhere from 100 to close to 300 tables defined and available to anyone with a bm3 license and tuners listed in the Tuner Directory. Each of those tables takes time to define for each software version and adding it all up across all these versions its been a huge effort and there are well over 10k table definitionsOTS maps have seen a number of revisions over the last while as well all of which require working with customers around the World, different climates/ambients, elevation, driving conditions. OTS maps have been tested and work the same at sea level as well as they do at 6000+ft up. High altitude testing was actually a major hurdle that took a significant amount of time and testing to make perfect and we're happy that its behind us now as well and the OTS maps are making incredible gains there as well over stock softwarebootmod3 tuned cars have won racing events in the 1/4, 1/2 mile across the globe and continue to get faster and more refined as more really great tuners and enthusiasts take charge in customizing their cars for nothing but the best performance without compromise.Our tech and sales support websites have been a great help for many and have generated close around 1900 support tickets combined and we've done and continue to do our best to respond to everyone as quickly and efficiently as possible.Our sincerest thank you to everyone in this community that's supported us and given us a chance to demonstrate what this new approach can offer to end users.and now, back to work!\n\nPTF/Bootmod3 ftw!!!After dealing with jb4 for only 5 months with frustration firmware headaches not improving etc. I started seeing the Customer Service, Support, Features and DEDICATION you have shown to BMW i knew last year this is where I had to be in.I continue to prove Bootmod3 is superior in every way imaginable because if you see and take a look at the fastest but reliable cars in the world are only FLASH tune. There's no tricks, just a great team, smart/wise tuning techniques and doing things a different way than most others this along with TONS of development even after being ABOVE stands out and continues to put BM3 team in the #1 spot with nothing in #2 as they're no where half near.I am a living proof, running against all N55 weighing anywhere from 500-1000lbs lighter cars and they stand no chance under 100mph these cars are having a hard time even until 110-120mph where Aerodynamics just comes in play.

    "content": "Well, sometimes it's great to be first...sometimes. I searched this entire forum for P304 and came up blank.I just got back from a week with a lot of miles. 400 miles to South Carolina for an eclipse house.....400 miles back on Friday, then immediately 150 or so to Orlando for a concert....and 150 home from Orlando today. 1160 miles total (was a nice drive in this car....my first extended driving test).Literally 4 miles from my house, the light turned green....I gave it about 1/2 throttle....not much at all, just enough for a little exhaust noise and some seat pushback (roads were wet)......and it lights up. The little engine icon and message about drivetrain malfunction. The car went into what I think was limp mode.....ran like crap. Note on the screen about car is driveable but full performance is not. I got home and dug up a P304 code: cyl 4 misfire.Light seems to have gone out...I'm going to do a test drive after I finish unpacking. It'll go to the dealer for sure to sort it out. Just curious if anyone else has seen this?Whatever the case, I'll provide some details how everything turns out.Update: Ran 5 minutes down the road. All ran fine.  Still gonna see the dealer.\n\nDealer had an open spot with a loaner at 8 in the morning.  We'll see what they come up with, if anything.\n\nMy money's on coil pack. (I had an Audi previously, where the 2.0T was notorious for coil pack oopsies)\n\nDo you have a new air box or filter? What mods if anything do you have?\n\nSorry guys, been buried @ work. Zero mods, for the most part (no engine stuff).Took it to the dealer on Tuesday morning. Their book says clear the code, drive 10 miles and if it doesn't reoccur, no harm no foul.I could have told them that. The code self cleared after 30 minutes and I drove it about 30 miles before the dealer saw it.I'll keep an eye on it for sure, which is what I told them. This is not something I expected from a brand new car.Hey, I got a free car wash, right? Didn't get all the bugs off the front from Georgia though. I swear some of those are so big they must have come out of a wormhole.\n\n\n\nMan this is just another example of whimpy codes the M2 has been throwing..... I keep reading about them, ghost codes etc. I ran the crap out of my M4 with some under hood mods and the only time it coded was when I trimmed out on E85. I hope mine does not prove to be sensitive.......I need to establish some ground rules upon delivery with the beast\n\nI also had a ghost code / CEL.By the time I got it to the dealer, it cleared itself.Dealer said they couldn't find anything stored, ad were not sure what caused it.However, my car never went into limp mode, and ran fine.  At that time, only mod I had was drop in K&N filter (no oil) with about 200 miles on it.\n\nI wouldn't think too much of it.  These days emissions controls are so ridiculous that hyper sensitive emissions parts like O2 sensors can throw all kinds of codes on extended drives. As an example, in my E39 M5 I had high flow cats. Every 5,000km it would through an emissions code. Up until that point, if you viewed the data in INPA, you'd see tons of smaller logged errors on the emissions system before it finally gives up and throws a code.With modern BMWs that usually comes with a limp mode.\n\nIt it was an emission code, I'd clear it and see if it came back. I figured I'd take it in as it was a misfire code (with limp) on a brand new car. I only had about 3500 miles on it at that point. I figure better safe than something else.\n\nI saw a youtube video of the vf-engineering M2 at the track with less than 3,000 miles on it, did one run and threw a misfire code, bad coil pack.  It might be somewhat common.\n\nI threw a CEL at 400 miles into my break-in. After reading code it was random misfire in cyl 5, but it was a few days old by the time I pulled the code, thought it might be bad gas. Few days later it comes back. Took it in, found out it was a bad plug. Swapped it in a different cylinder and problem followed.I hope it's something simple for you like my issue. Replacing a coil pack so early on would concern me a little.",

    "content": "Hey guys, picked up my M2 a few days ago.  The sales guy told me that overboost was disabled until the 1200 mile service..I'm now nervous that they would somehow forget to enable it at the service and I would lose almost 30 lb-ft of torque pleasure forever.So, a couple of questions:- Is that even true that Overboost is not enabled until the 1200 mile service?- How can I verify if it's indeed disabled/enabled?- Wouldn't the Sports Display show the extra torque?I did a hard pull from 2,000 rpm to about 5,500 rpm and could see the torque on the Sports Display at about 370 which would include overboost.  But not sure if that proves anything.Referring to that sports display thing:\n\nIt's enabled from day one.  The only restriction of power is the control of your foot.  If you have a DCT the launch control gets turned on at the first service.\n\nI call BS on what your dealer says. You can test overboost yourself.Get onto a long straight road and up to speed, Say 80-90 in 5th gear (MT), foot to the floor and high revs. Now pedal it. You'll feel the extra boost kick in for a few seconds\n\nSounds like he got it confused with Launch Control, or at least thinks they go hand in hand.As others have stated, overboost is available from the start and LC gets enabled after the 1,200mi service.\n\nDon't rely on that monitor for actual diagnostics, it's not an in-car dyno.\n\nThat \"Sports display\" is BS.One. It's been on BMWs well before the M2.Two. It's not accurate at all.Three. WTF does it not include more information?  Lazy Programing?Mine routinely pins at 400 hp and 400 ft pounds.Mike\n\n\n\nHe was just trying to overboost your ego.\n\nStill, dealers from around the globe seems to say the exact same thing, enabeling full power at the run-in service, that begs the question as to what leads them to all say this ? Do they have an internal document that says this or do we have extraordinary luck that dealers from different country says the exact same BS ?\n\n\n\n\n\nI think the most likely reason there is confusion might be because sales folks get confused by Launch Control.  Or maybe other M-cars that might have the full power unlocked after 1200 mile service (like M5?).  Anyone know if M3s/M4s have full power enabled on day 1 or not?\n\nThe clear majority of sales guys don't give a shit, or know shit about, the cars they sell anymore.  Might as well be refrigerators.  If you find one that does, give him business and referrals.  If he tracks his own cars, even better.  Same for service managers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Yes*Yes*And what I thought. Ask the dealer or break the speed limit by a factor of 2+ in most locations. Was hoping you could go into the idrive and see it somewhere?\n\nI'm generally curious how it works. It comes on in certain gear and speed conditions correct? And for a maximum of 7 seconds I think? I assume there is a cooldown. Is that cooldown a fixed time or intercooler temp based?\n\n\n\nThe 1M (N54B30T0 engine) featured a torque of 500 Nm / 369 lb-ft in overboost mode: 450 Nm + 50 Nm in normal operation;The M2 (N55B30T0 engine) features a torque of 500 Nm / 369 lb-ft in overboost mode: 465 Nm + 35 Nm in normal operation.1M Technical Training (seehere):4.1.2. M Engine dynamics controlAs on the BMW Z4 sDrive35is, the maximum torque of 450Nm/295 ft lbs is briefly raised (for five seconds max.) to 500Nm/369 ft lbs by the overboost function. The precondition for the overboost function is a demand for acceleration of more than 80%. The increased torque is available from as low as 1,500 rpm right through to 4,500 rpm. That means that the torque gain can be as much as 100 Nm compared to the BMW 135i . Although in the first two gears the loss of traction limits the amount of power and torque that can be transmitted, more than 450Nm/295 ft lbs can be delivered from third gear on, and 500Nm/369 ft lbs from fourth gear on. When the DSC is active and maximum acceleration is called for, forward thrust is limited in first, second and third gears in favor of handling stability. Configuration is based on the optimum traction.M2 Technical Training (seehere):4.1.5. Exhaust turbochargingOverboostOn the N55B30T0 engine, the torque is increased from 465 Nm/343 lb-ft to 500 Nm/369 lb-ft (overboost) by a brief increase in the charging pressure of 0.1 bar above the normal charging pressure.\n\n",

I plan on getting the Dinan P2 package later on, so getting a Dinan IC would cut the costs down a little bit more before I go full balls to the wall.But, my only grip is that it requires cutting of the inside of the bumper, to fit it in. I'm probably gonna get it done at my local dealership, but the only reason I'd get the wagner was cause it's just pure bolt on, no cutting required and cheaper while I wait to purchase the full P2 package at once.. and if I did, I'd probably sell the Wagner later on to get the Dinan.What should I do?\n\nWait....... or buy the Wagner and agree to sell it to me discounted soon\n\nYou'll save 10% on the P2 package if you go with their IC and any potential problems will be covered under warranty. People bitch and moan about cutting the bumper. It's really not that labor intensive. As an added bonus, you're reducing weight from the vehicle\n\nIf your going to do the Dinan P2 package that seems to answer your question right there.  You want to use the entire Dinan package so you have everything playing together nicely and under warranty.  Personally I wouldn't do anything until the P2 package and then do everything at once, I am sure its the most cost effective way to go about doing this.\n\n\n\n\n\nI debated this same topic quite a while mostly because I didnt want to cut anything...Once I got passed that blockage I went with the DINAN primarily because the surface area out weighed having to cut.I have some pics on my thread comparing the DINAN side by side with the OEM.. And I have seen in data logs the difference the DINAN makes on hot days..\n\nDon't they also have to cut some bars? I think that's the scariest part to me.

Also with the switch you can have semi tame or aggressive at a flip of a button. So far i have only heard the stock exhaust in person so am not biased either way. But watching the Renner videos at Road Atlanta...the MPE sounds sweet\n\nI have a full Fi Exhaust System on my Car, and with the Catless downpipe, I've also heard many different exhausts on M2s, 135i, even a new 140i. These range from Akra, Remus, MPE, Armytrix etc etc.I can tell you, Fi Exhaust is by far the loudest except for Armytrix, which is similar, but Armytrix has a very deep 1,000-3,000 RPM.Fi Exhaust had pops and crackles equivalent to gun shots, and when I was at an event, we had some cars turn on and show their exhausts which seemed nice, as soon as I fired my Fi Exhaust up and gave it a blip..A flock of people like birds came flying with their phone out.. I mean I have the carbon tips which look exactly like the akra ones, and even people amongst my group mistook it for akra, as soon as I blip, they came closer to look and inspect!The exhaust completely shat on every other BMW there including stock 458/aventador etc.It's very very loud and atrocious, I personally love it!Now... With the valves closed, in cabin it actually is quieter than stock, heck even outside is quieter but past 3,000 it's louder than stock..So actually works well at night time when you wanna head home quietly.The downpipe is a great fitment for the engine.And very easy to install, it also comes with a module that checks RPM and boost level etc. which is pretty cool (plugs into OBD2)I've heard a lot of exhausts in person, and this is by far my favourite, just a tip.. It pops and crackled so loud even off throttle at 1,800. And yes...Traction mode exhaust still applies and it's ridiculous.It pops like crazy in sport as well, and backfires so loud people think your shooting a rifle, especially in a built up high rise area.If anyone wants a listen, hit me up in Melbourne, Australia.There is no word of a lie, if you want insane, you can only go Fi, if you want something else medium, go with MPE as its OEM.Also, build quality is good, welds are good and from a supplier of multiple products (Remus, MPE, fi, army, etc etc.) all have told me Fi have a high build quality if you want some insanity in your sound.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone is interested, I have an \"as new\" 200km Remus Exhaust I will be posting for sale shortly.  Purchased the exhaust from another forum member who had it on their car for 200kms and was never installed on my car.  I've since sold the car and have no need for the exhaust.

This decreases output a tad but allows access to the entire rev band, which made the track experience much more enjoyable. I?m hoping that Dinan Engineering can chime in to explain why the safeguard in S4 wont allow full access of horsepower.\n\nSo it happens only when you push really hard like on track?

Haven't heard the Dinan so I can only provide MPE feedback.Pros- car will sound like a beast- ability to have 2 distinct modes - sport and trackCons- it's expensive- it may set off other car alarms on cold start- it does drone a bit between 70mph and 80 mph- won't make the car any quicker\n\n\n\nMperformance with valves open. It ignores the rear silencer. Car howls like only a \"rear silencer delete\" can sound.Absolutely love the Mperformance. Looks with carbon endtips are spot on!\n\nOnly way you can truly have an individual compare is if you have had a car which had both systems. Or else you will just get biased answers from the people who own them.I am extremely happy with the Dinan setup and the price point is excellent. For the price of the M Perf you can basically buy the whole Dinan setup and have money left for a sport cat downpipe.If you want to compare them you need to have two cars in front of you one with MPE and one with Dinan and decide on which suits your taste.https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=de...&v=ErmQFsqsbME\n\nBoth are excellent components.

It was going to cost somewhere near 4k. So I figured 4k is about the same as some serious other aftermarket companies. So I started to look around which lead me to Dinan.I LOVE THE SOUND, its perfect. Inside the cabin is just right, outside is loud as hell. Especially if you live close by neighbors or in a parking garage. Its way loud, I used to have a C63 AMG and its comparable as far as decibels. A faint little turbo sound comes out at the end. Makes me want to drive with windows down.Plus Dinans exhaust and res delete together are 2k, so you can spend more money on more mods!\n\nAM I correct in assuming the Dinan does ont have any valve system so that it has the same volume regardless of driving mode?\n\n",

If you have an uncool SA or a major repair that can be linked to your mod, then it's likely BMW will investigate and find your mods. Then your claim would most likely be denied.\n\n\n\nIf you tune 🙄,you must be prepared to pay to play after ,I. really have no issue with BMW on this.If you have  a drivetrain issue bend over and take your medicine 💵💵💸\n\n\n\nYou crack open the DME and tune it and you get a call from BMW stating that you have lost your Powertrain warranty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIve gone in multiple times for service without issues or being flagged. Im running BM3 and my really close buddy is an SA and said they didnt pick up anything on the scanner.\n\nSeems popular that every Non-BM3 Tune is the one getting flagged/voiding powertrain warranty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best thing for warranty is to get a Dinan tune installed at a BMW dealer that is still a Dinan dealer. The dealership will not void your warranty if they are the ones who sold you the product and installed it.My local Dealer is one of those, so I stick with Dinan and BMW Perf parts. I've been running Dinan Stage 2 flash tune and BMW PE on my 135 for years under warranty without a single issue.They even replaced my transmission (an odd thing to need replacing for a 6MT) under warranty. Not even a furrowed brow from them about the possibility that the big torque bump from the tune could have affected it (contrary to many dealer horror stories about voiding warranties).When I get my M2, I will go to the same dealer and have Dinan installed (eventually the P3).So, if your warranty is a priority, find a dealer that is cool with mods like mine, and preferably have them install it.\n\nUnless you are in purely optimal conditions (e.g., at sea level, dense air, etc.) I think BMW would be hard pressed to detect any piggyback if removed prior to servicing.If you're doing a full reflash I mean.. yeah. Would you void your customer's warranty? Tunes are a tough one. Things like exhaust are relatively straight forward as, really, you're cutting out emissions nonsense and, if anything, making the car more reliable on a technical basis.

    "content": "So has anyone tried both for comparison?  I have the JB+ now and think that it makes pretty good power.  But I was thinking about swapping it out for the Dinan piece.  Just trying to see if it is actually worth it.\n\nI've been following the Dinan Sport Tuner threads also. I believe they both max out at +4psi. I have a JB+ for the record. They work exactly the same way by modifying the air sensor reading to trick turbo into making higher boost. DME takes just a split second to catch up and add required fuel. The only benefit of the Dinan I'm aware of is the Bluetooth logging and switching capabilities. Most of us just crank the JB+ up to max anyway and never mess with it again. So far, with a DP and IC, the car pulls very well. Under full throttle, the tires never hook up until halfway through 3rd gear. Very amusingI would've bought the Dinan if it was available a few months back. 100$ extra over the JB+ is nothing. If anybody else has more/better info please add on.\n\nMy understanding was basically the same as yours.  Yeah, I have mine cranked up all the way too.  I will probably just stick with JB+ for now (unless anyone wants to buy mine, lol).  I don't really care about the bluetooth and data logging ability.

With some RON 98 (93 to you guys), it pulls noticeably stronger, even pulled a guy with a DP and JB4 on map 1 but with RON 95. Only issue I've had is that I loose that really nice bang in second gear if floor it and pull off below 4800 rev/min...? Anybody else get that ?\n\nIs the slightly delay of the DME to adjust the fuel and timing noticeable while driving? I am interesting in getting a cheaper option like one of these to couple with a FMIC that would be easy to take out if I wanted to change it later on.I have a DCT full dinan exhaust and drop in filter.",

I too am not looking to get an aftermarket exhaust. This comes after having a BMWP exhaust on my e90 and my e82.

Material cost shouldnt be terrible so if your game give it a shot. There are plenty of videos online to see how it is done.  I wrapped the interior pieces of my e90 with CF wrap and found it to be pretty easy to work with and of course that was dealing with many contours.

    "content": "Hey guys, quick update from us on what's been cooking up over the past few weeks with bootmod3. We've pushed out the latest updates on the web that have been in testing over the last while with a number of great tuners out there. We've pushed out version 0.9.35 on the Web (http://www.bootmod3.net) and the Android app is already live on this version. Apple is as usual, going through the review and should be up in the next 24-48 hours on 0.9.35 as well.Here's a quick summary of what's been done so far. We'll be adding some pics in this thread of the editor and some videos are coming that'll demo some of the features we've built into the bm3 platform overall.Version 0.9.35:- Large number of custom tuning updates- S55, N55-EWG (including M2) and N55-PWG table additions- Editor: Import map feature supporting imports across ROMs (different software versions)- View user datalogs inside editor when looking at a Tune Request as a tuner user- My Maps screen: Request Map for custom tunes with tuners from Tuner Directory- Map Screen: Request Update on any map that came from any tuner and send to them for an update- Comment on maps while working with a tuner- Email Service Integrated: Instant email notifications to users and tuners as tune is being created. In-app notifications to follow soon- Tuner Directory: Shops and Tuner additions- Custom Maps: Shows change history with ability to add further comments- Custom Tuning Editor: Export Map as a file, save locally for future reference/back if needed. Ability to send the map file to another user to load into their account, optionally lock it to a VIN and lock it from being viewable if so desired.- Wired USB cable connection option for the BM3 device agentOn the tunes front we have had a major new release of the S55 OTS maps in those last 3 weeks and they're provided through the bootmod3 system. Tons of testing on the N55 EWG (many things apply to the PWG as well, if not most minus some boost control details) that's being incorporated into a coming update to all N55 OTS maps.Many of you are already on the latest OTS release and very soon updates won't need to be requested but just obtained through the app/web through an OTS Maps screen. You'll also be notified of any new OTS map updates as they get released automaticallyNext up we're working on adding the sliders for many people's favourite, burble adjustment, duration and aggression, exhaust flaps setups, boost by gear for those that drag race and are looking to optimize launch, and a few others. You'll be able to take any map from stock to OTS and apply your custom burble and exhaust flap configuration to them and then flash without affecting any other parts of the tune.\n\nReserved for pics/vids..\n\n\n\nReally amazing! I know what Ill be having fun with this this weekendYou guys are the best!\n\nExcited for the updates especially the sliders for burbles and boost by gear\n\nThanks guys!Just a heads up, Apple has now finally approved version 0.9.35 in the App Store\n\nWill the boost by gear work with the 6speed or is this a DCT feature only?\n\n",

If I tried to accelerate even beyond moderate levels, the wheels would just spin.No CEL, only for 10 milesBut wow, what an impression it made right off the bat! I have a full Dinan cat back and a CTS intake. The sound is way too quiet for me. Fired it up with the cat and what a difference. Much more aggressive. It sounds like all the sound deadening material was removed. Louder more metallic revs. Sounds like a something off of a track. I am finally fully pleased with the sound. Made me start to giggle when I revved it.Will follow up with my impression of performance when it dries up outside\n\nAgreed.Very loudVery aggressiveVery satisfyingIt's amazing how basically a higher flowing cat affects the entire exhaust system.\n\nJust wait till you let off the gas in an underground parking garage with it in sport or sport + and get the burbles.  So loud.  Makes people dive for their cars!\n\nJust drove it for about another 10 miles. Sound is indeed significantly different and louder. The effect of change from stock cat to fabspeed is greater than the effect of stock exhaust to Dinan system. When I put on the Dinan system, I though well thats a little better.

What temperatures do you guys see/notice?\n\nCompletely normal and completely fine.\n\ni see between 95 and 108C even in 40+C temps\n\nFor N55 engine this temperature is normal.\n\nSomething you should know is the cooler works harder in Sport and Sport+ mode than Comfort, so the car gets up to temperature faster in Comfort and probably cruises at a higher temp as well.This all means if you want to cool the turbo down after a drive idle the car in sport for a minute for faster cooling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe engine is more thermally efficient at a higher temp, with better VE and fuel efficiency.  So, the new M- motors run hot in Comfort.  Since temps rise significantly under more boost and higher throttle inputs, additional cooling (fan, etc) is provided to stabilize temps when on-track or spirited driving (i.e. in Sport/Sport +)Nice design element, IMO\n\n",

    "content": "Just perusing the ol extreme powerhouse website here and finding many more downpipe options than I thought. With cats, and without fancy finishes, here's a list of prices.Remus $1350Fabspeed $1135 (fan favourite?)Frequency Intelligence $1000AFe $900Wagner $800Evolution Racewerks $800AR $700Can anyone shine some light on any particular strengths of these guys? Weaknesses? I really just do not want a CEL but plan on picking a DP at some point. Would be nice to save a few hundred bucks if quality doesn't suffer.\n\nI think, Downpipes are pretty much the same.They all have a inlet 4' diameter, what your looking for it fitment, the better the fitment the better it will be as there should be a full seal to prevent any leak. Also one that has less bends is more advantages for more free flowing.As for a no CEL. I highly recommend Fabspeed as they have had great feedback from USERS. (Word of mouth is extremely truthful and useful).Other then that, it will come down the material they use (Stainless 316 is better than 304). and how good the weld is.Other then that, downpipes are FAIRLY similar (Short pipe lol)\n\nMy father used to say, \"do it right the first time\".  So you initially save some money by cheaping out, we all do it and never seem to learn, so you get a great price initially, but by the time you figure how to solve getting rid of the CEL, passing emissions tests you most likely have invested more money trying to solve the issue. The reason I went with Fabspeed was the fact that pretty much no one has gotten a CEL with these, maybe bordering on 100% no CEL.  Did catted downpipes on my 135i (N54), supposedly won't throw a code, they did, had to install O2 simulator to fix it.  The installed JB4 would clear the codes on auto clear, but also clears the memory so there was no history on the ECU which the testing computer would find unacceptable and reject the car.  The dilemma was In order to get the history to show all systems go you had to drive the car to create a new history, but with auto clear off, and chances are the magic CEL would reappear in the process.  Eliminating the code with a code reader would clear the fault and the history.  Wish I had had the Fabspeed option available in 2008.\n\nEvery downpipe will eventually throw a CEL even stock, as they get older the Cells in the cat eventually become dust and you'll have no cats which will trigger CEL with the O2 sensors.\n\n\n\nIf it is a reputable brand like HJS cats, there wont be any problem I guess.\n\nYes this is correct. HJS are renounced for their high quality Cells within cats, less prone to breaking down. However eventually all cars do. But it may be like 8-10 years+ depends on the quality of OEM and also how hard the cells have to work to filter stuff out, but that stuff all depends on how hard you drive the car too!However, by the time that happens warranty is over and the CEL wont cause the car to go into limp mode (limited power) so you'll be fine, there are many ways to clear CEL, including o2 simulators, clearing code apps, tuning etc etc.\n\nMy E39 M5's OEM HJS cats were done for at 130,000km. It didn't throw codes but it smelled awful and actually reduced performance. So that's nothing new to me.But IIRC only the Fabspeed has HJS cats and yet the prices are all over the place.  There's negative feedback outside of this forum as well towards Fabspeed. So I am not 100% convinced Fabspeed is the defintive name in quality and isn't overpriced. That said if it's the only one replicating OEM quality, I guess that's what I'll go with.\n\nI had my Performance Edition in for the 1200 mile first service and the tech was impressed with the Fabspeed, and was amazed at the exhaust note, stating it was incredible and further commented it was the best sounding exhaust he had heard on any BMW, fwiw.\n\nIMO.Go with a Fi Exhaust (Catless) + tune.Because its valvedit can make it as quiet as stock, or as loud as you want! Even an auto mode when it surpasses 3,500 RPM the valves auto open.Best sound + more power gain too!\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the full Fi Exhaust is what can I say..LOUD and WOW. its definitely on the louder side of things for exhausts.It's a jaw dropping exhaust system.Thats what I like, but depends on the user!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI plan on going with the HJS Euro 6 catted downpipe.  It's quite pricey, but looks very OEM and very high quality.  It has a 300 cell HJS cat vs the 200 cell HJS cat used on the Fabspeed DP.  The higher cell count will reduce exhaust volume compare to the Fabspeed and other catted DP setups.  The extra $200-300 is worth it to me.http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1339166\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A hammer is not one of them.\n\nJust twist as you pull them off. Pretty easy.\n\n\n\nYou should be able to pull them off without any tools, as mentioned above twisting while pulling will make the task easier\n\n\n\nMine were put on by Odin himself and then Thor gave them a tap for good measure. I have tried 5 times to get them off, including mallets and pullers...they are still on there. I haven't tried twisting while pulling though, ill give it a shot.\n\nTwisting while pulling can bend the spring clips, FYI.\n\nThere is a thread somewhere describing the multiple ways. Most of us did well with a block of wood and rubber mallet. Apply WD40, let sit for 15-30min and whack away. 3-4 good smacks should do it at that point. Don't be bashful when hammering.\n\nI got all 4 off by twisting and pulling in less than 10 min, no hammer, no WD40, no damage. Just make sure you grab it by the front not rear.\n\nI pulled my M2 tips out so I can paint it myself as I felt like the aftermarket options were not to my liking. I had to use a 6\" gear puller from harbor freight tools and had to use it with a 12 foot socket wrench handle. I also tried using a piece of wood with a mallet and that did not work too well.",

    "content": "Our BMW F87 M2 project for our friend Amanda, has undergone some extensive modification over the past few weeks. So far we have been focused more on the visual aspect of the vehicle, improving the looks and aerodynamics with RKP Carbon Fiber and KW Suspension. Now that we have the vehicle looking the way we like, naturally the next thing to do was performance upgrades. To free up the flow of exhaust and add a signature sound to the N55 Twin turbo straight 6, we opted for the Armytrix Valvetronic exhaust system. And the reason for this choice will soon be obvious as soon as you watch the video! Armytrix absolutely nailed this system! This is by far, the best sounding straight 6 I have ever heard! Take a listen!\n\nSounds awesome\n\nStock downpipe? How much does this system run?\n\n\n\nThat does sound good, especially if it's twin turbo as stated. Unfortunately, I'm sure it's a typo. Sorry, prospective M2 Competition buyers.\n\nNiiiice !!!! How does the price of that compare with the M-Performance exhaust ? Not taking into account the cost of the catless downpipe.\n\nI have an Armytrix exhaust on my 435i, and I won't ever buy another exhaust from them again.\n\nSounds great.  Wish a cattless downpipe wasnt required to get it.  Do you have a vid with the cat still installed?\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't care what it sounds like when it looks like shit from the rear. Great looking flanges! Not\n\n\n\nAlso advice to anyone considering this, donâÂÂt ever get their downpipes.For the money they charge you, you?re better off with ER downpipes.All N55 downpipes (including stock catalytic converter) have an outlet size of 4?. Armytrix has a 4? flange but a 2.8? pipe (It?s been a couple of months since I threw my Armytrix downpipe away), look up Venturi effect and you?ll see why this is trash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvividracingin which mode was the car when you revved it? Was Traction mode engaged? I think it wasn't...The quality levels of Armytrix exhausts is the fact that worries me. I heard so many problems with them. The remote you get with is a bit of a fail in my opinion. It is really cheap and on the M2 it is pretty much useless.My valve is always open, since in Sport, Sport+ and Traction the valve is always open. The only time it is closed is in comfort mode and then I can open it via my Awron display... but in all honesty I never do it. All in all, it is useless to override it with a remote. Keep it connected to the stock set up!In my opinion this is DEFINITELY not the best exhaust made for a M2, and I also think it is not the best sounding out there. It completely lacks the high pitch snap around 3,5K RPM some of the other exhausts have.My last point is how low the two pipes are passing the diff... not sure mine are so low. I would be worried if I lowered my M2 to rip those off driving over a puthole or ridge which is a sticking out.MR\n\n",

Can someone with more technical knowledge chip in ?\n\nAs for how long I'm following BMW community(past 4 years), I didn't hear that any piggy back has caused an engine/turbo issue.In fact there are some piggy back which works ok, other are not so well.HJS 300 is bit expensive compared to regular wagner downpipe but it shouldn't trigger a CEL.If warranty is your main concern, and you feel that you might be unlucky until it expires then go with AC Schnitzer piggy back.You can trow in any downpipe, and in the case that your engine breaks down just switch it the original one.But, if you want to get a cheap and reliable upgrade, just get a 200 or 300 cell downpipe and bigger intercooler.You can easily shred of 2 seconds from 100-200 km/h time without a tune.\n\nI've experienced no adverse impacts with my current sport cat/ECU piggyback, only advantageous and beneficial ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteinbauer",

I'd love to see how that quote is wrote up. $8k is way to much for labor.\n\n\n\nPedals - 1 hourCold air intake - 1 hourRoll bars - 7 hoursSuspension link - 4 hoursCoilovers - 9.2 hoursIntercooler - 4.5 hoursExhaust - 1.2 hoursTurbo - 5 hoursTuner - 1.5 hoursTotal: 34.4 hours. What's their labor rate? $160 is standard so there's 15 hours of overcharges here but certain areas could charge more or less. At $160 the difference is $2400 which means labor should be $5300.Couple of things. #1, you don't need the $500 \"ECU only\" whatever the hell they tacked on. #2, DINAN offers a 10% discount on parts if you order the full S2 kit and they are charging you retail there. #3, all hours pulled from Dinan's S2 page here:https://www.dinancars.com/product/f8...ries&mid=1243/\n\nFYI, some dealers will offer 15% off parts and labor for DINAN if you are part of the CCA.  I have been pricing out upgrades for the car, and that is pretty easy to get without negotiating.  Check with your BMWCCA chapter for sponsor dealers/installers (http://www.boston-bmwcca.org/friends/discounts.aspx).  That being said, some dealers have quoted $270-300/hr for labor\n\nThis is an older thread, but I might add that some independent shops are approved Dinan installers (mine is). Of course that could enable a much better deal.\n\nIs Dinan still warranting M2 for tunes? I had a 228 with a Stage 1 and it was a huge improvement.\n\nI would get estimates from Performance Technic in Fremont and SD AutoTech (owned by Steve Dinan himself) in Mountainview. I have spoken to both shops and believe you will save at least 25% over the SF BMW bid and have mechanics with more experience installing the equipment doing the work.So far I have only put the Dinantronics Stage 1 and Fabspeed sport cat on....waiting to pull the trigger on the intercooler and big turbo install.For suspension work I am having AleksShop (next to Performance Technic in Fremont) install the Ohlin R&T coilovers with slightly lower spring rated 80N/mm front and 160N/mm rear...I think this will substantially outperform the Dinan system on both the road and the track.\n\n\n\n\n\n8k in labor only!?!?

I understand in the making of the M2 CS they are swapping the N55 for the S55 but can we through water cooling see similar gains to transform our cars to be CS like? Expert opinions much appreciated thank you!\n\nI don't see how you can do better than the Bosch system, and they only claim 5% increase in performance. You may however be able to safely raise boost or hold it longer do to lower combustion temps. So maybe add another 5%.  My guess it that with a tune, you could get around 360whp on 93oct with no other changes.  The M2 CS will probably make 50whp more than that stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nWater injection on any motor not tuned for it won't give you any extra power. You'll just be able to go longer in heated conditions without losing any.If you add combustion temp cooling you can usually start playing with the timing advance to find the maximum brake torque values at WOT. Most cars will stay slightly retarded from that max value from factory as a safety margin. If you have direct control of the wg you might be able to squeeze 1 or 2 more psi from a stock turbo in the top end and make small gains (at the expense of killing the turbo).",

    "content": "Hello all,Now that some people are finally getting their hands on some ///M2's and aftermarket parts are starting to emerge, I thought I'd give my long overdue review of myFabspeed MotorsportSport Cat downpipe and Muffler Bypass...I have long knownofFabspeed Motorsport; I drive by their shop at least once a week (my daughters go to swim right down the street). I honestly was not aware that they dealt with aftermarket parts for BMW's. I was used to seeing more \"exotic\" cars out in their lot. However after some research I found out that they have had a good amount of experience in tuning and developing parts for the F22. I contacted Bobby Ashton at Fabspeed, who is their BMW specialist (he also drives an m235). They were more than happy to get their hands on an ///M2, as this was back in May and there just weren't many out in the wild.So after speaking with Bobby and checking out their website, I knew that what I'd be interested in was some sort of downpipe. Wasn't sure if I wanted to go catless or catted at this point. Bobby invited me to check out their shop and talk about options. Attached below are some pics of my first visit. As many of us here on the forums, this is not my first enthusiasts car, and I have never kept any of my cars in stock form. So I have had a good amount of experience with tuners. I must say that Fabspeed's showroom and shop area is the most impressive one I've dealt with. The showroom is spotless as is the shop area. They fabricate nearly everything in house. I was given a thorough tour of the entire place. Everyone I spoke to seemed extremely knowledgeable and very enthusiastic about tuning cars. I'm not sure how to embed photos and videos, so here are some pics from my first visit to the shop, followed by pics of the exhaust/DP installed on my car, and the dynograph:I can't say enough positives about my experience with Fabspeed. When I dropped off my car, they thoroughly inspected it for any damage, and took pictures of the car (now I know this was also a \"cover my a$$\" move on their part as well), but it was a nice touch. They took down the mileage, how much gas was in the tank, and asked if I wanted my license plate blurred out if they post pictures online. During the whole installation process their were two times where I needed the car back, so they dropped it off at my house. Car was always washed when I picked it up. One time I dropped by unannounced, and the driver's seat was wrapped in clear plastic, with the standard paper mats by the pedals. All my OEM parts were wrapped with enough bubble wrap that I could probably toss if off my second floor deck and there'd be no damage.Now onto the most important stuff- my thoughts on their products. First off, I don't think anyone will question the quality of their products. Seriously. Look at their stuff. Welds and finish are top top notch. They have to be. Most of their customers are driving truly exotic, truly very expensive cars, and want their aftermarket parts to match in quality. My lowly M2 looked out of place in their shop.I decided to go with their Sport Cat downpipe, because I didn't want to deal with any CELs. It's been asked numerous times on the forums whether their catted DP will throw a CEL. It will not. I checked out the m235 forums and lots of people there have their catted DPs, and no one has had any issues. Build quality, as expected, is top notch. The sound? Best to watch the videos that Fabspeed has included in their original exhaust thread. That is my car in the video, and while it mostly accurately gives you a sense of how the car sounds, I think it sounds even better in real life. The DP exaggerates and multiples the \"burbles\" that we all love.In terms of performance, you can check out the below posted dyno. My butt dyno tells me the car feels a bit peppier, a bit more eager to get on boost. Night and day? By no means. Does it transform the car into an absolute beast? No. But I sincerely do feel the car pulls a bit harder. And now itsoundslike a beastYou can also hear the turbo spool up a bit. Bottom line, I love the Sport Cat DP. For me, it's perfect. I get the sound, along with some performance gains, and NO CEL.On to the muffler bypass. Initially, I had no plans on doing anything with the exhaust. But I was so satisfied with the DP, I decided to give the Muffler Bypass a shot. Admittedly, you won't see any performance gains with this product. You do lose some weight (I believe around 14lbs?). Once again, in terms of build quality, no concerns or issues.The look of the exhaust- I think it looks great. Initially, when I first saw it on the car, I was a bit hesitant. I thought the pipes were a bit large, and extended out a bit too much. But I quickly realized that was not the case, and I really really like the brushed stainless look (I believe they have other tip styles as well).Now the most important quality to an aftermarket exhaust is...the sound (IMO). So..the one thing to note about the muffler bypass is, that on initial startup, particularly cold starts, the thing is LOUD. Like rattle the rear view mirror, wake up sleeping kids loud. However, for whatever reason, after about 10 seconds after startup, the exhausts quiets down SIGNIFICANTLY. Not sure why (wastegate closing/opening???). After this point, I think the exhaust sounds FANTASTIC. While the DP increases the amount of \"burbles\", the exhaust amplifies the volume of the burbles and all the other good sounds this car naturally makes. Windows down, in nice weather, it sounds GLORIOUS. Seriously.The next big question is, what about any drone? I have had numerous cars with numerous aftermarket exhausts, and I have yet to find one without ANY drone. And this exhaust is the same. However, I notice that it is within a relatively small RPM range (say 2800-3200), at highway cruising speeds. Is it unbearable? By no means. Is it noticeable? Yes. But as with most aftermarket exhausts, it's largely manageable with some thoughtful throttle control. Although my ///M2 is my DD, I usually drive only 5-7k miles a year, and don't do much highway driving, so what little drone there is is not really an issue. YMMV.OK, it's getting late, and I don't want to ramble. I wrote this post to give you what I hope is an unbiased review of my DP/Exhaust, as well as my experience with Fabspeed Motorsports. I couldn't be happier. From start to finish a thoroughly enjoyable experience dealing with those guys...Here is a link to the original exhaust thread, with a video clip of my car...http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1270926-c\n\nThanks for that very informative write-up ! I'm thinking of getting the same set-up when I get my M2 in the spring. The trouble is, I don't have any possibility of hearing it for real and can't really judge the volume on the videos.Could you possibly let us know how the sound quality and volume compare with the M-Performance exhaust ?I live in France which is not too fussy about volume in that the annual vehicle control only takes into account the pollution, not the sound. So the danger is the police at the roadside. If I see the police up ahead and try to drive as quietly as possible, can I disguise the fact I have a sport cat downpipe and straight through exhaust, do you think ? Or is the sound raucous at all engine speeds ?\n\nNice write up. Not a fan of the exhaust tips, they don't look very finished/refined looks like some muffler shop just chopped up some pipe and attached it.  The torque gains look good especially at daily driving RPMs\n\nThat shop is way too clean.I need to visit in person.When I sold my E36M3, I took off all the aftermarket parts to sell separately. I took off the AA exhaust (which BTW was awsome) and had the bright idea to start the car in the garage to \"hear what it would sound like\" Man that rattled the house and scared the crap out of the GF now wife. The reason for the long story is to ask...being the bypass is straight pipe and no muffler...isn't your car loud, like Bush car loud?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing I do not like about the exhaust is how the muffler pipes still out further than the OEM pipes. Any way to get them the same length as the OEM pipe?I do not like the look and the leg burn potential.\n\n\n\nGreat review.  I'm a little surprised, though, that you were not more definitive about the torque boost.   32 ft.-lbs of torque should definitely be noticeable throughout the rev range.I'm in for the sport catted DP as soon as I get my car.  Given where I live, and the fact my garage is attached to my house, I will pass for the time being on the bypass\n\n\n\nMore like waking up the missus, the kid and the dog early in the morning.  None of those entities reacts well to being woken up one minute before he or she have to be.\n\nThis sounds exactly what I'm looking for. I absolutely hate my neighbours who make a lot of noise shouting at each other late at night so this will ensure they wake up nice and early when I leave for work. I must say I really appreciate the feedback and quick, accurate replies from Fabspeed whenever I pose a question. Has anyone in Europe fitted this system ?\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=Fabspeed Motorsport;20590705]Thank you! And the torque boost is definitely noticeable, especially down low. When do you plan on taking delivery of your car?Well, my \"plan\" is pretty much dependent on BMW's plan.But I've got a slot, week 43 build.  Putting a couple of MP gizmos on at the port, so best guess is maybe by Christmas?\n\n[QUOTE=BruceM;20590981]\n\nAre there any clips of the stock exhaust with just the sport cat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas that start a cold start?  This isn't bad at all, really.  And it's practically mellow from the cockpit",

    "content": "After getting raw dogged from Dinan I decided to go a different route in terms of modification. Rather than upgrading the turbo I figured it'd try to maximize the efficiency of my current internals.With that in mind I decided to go for higher flow and more cooling to run a higher boost rate while the methanol will help reduce chance of me blowing my engine due to more dense and cooler air. But I'm kind of stuck on what brand or if I should go a different route.Currently I'm looking at getting:Fabspeed downpipeEventuri Intake/Dinan IntakeCSF Intercooler/Wagner Intercooler (Any recommendations would help)Dinan Exhaust (Dont know what else to go here)BMS/Snow Perfomance Methanol InjectionAs for tunes I'm deciding on either BM3 but I'd prefer to go for the JB4 due to the interaction with the BMS meth and the JB4 compatibility which changes the map on the fly if the meth runs out or boost juiceI'm not trying to go for balls to the wall power, I'm trying to take the Dinan route and go for a safe clean power.Just an FYI, This is my first time modifying a platform and I live in California so my gas is at 91, if that means anything to you guys\n\nYiruna,I've got a full exhaust with a de-cat downpipe (FI).Wagner evo comp 2 intercooler (to prevent heatsoak)Aluminium Chargepipe setESS Tuning (Flash tune)BMC Drop-in filter.I can tell you now, the stock airbox is very efficient, you may want to add in a drop-in filter but there really is no gain from this, maybe a little bit more noise and better throttle response if anything.The wagner evo 2 comp intercooler is to prevent heat sock on hot days or repeated bashing on a track. Think of this is a prevention of performance loss, rather than any specific gain in power. Going a bigger intercooler may see less throttle response (imo I cant feel it/negligible). With a bigger intercooler in mind, you'll definitely want to do chargepipes, as the stock ones are plastic and prone to cracking/damage.Exhaust are relatively simple, the stock exhaust is fairly free flowing and restricted by mainly the downpipe (Catalytic converter). The stock is 800CEL, so 100-200 cell and no-cat will see you gain some performance but, best maximised by a tune.The Fi Exhaust is insane, with valves closed its quiter than stock, with valves open its like gunshot pops/crackles, and screams with Wide open throttle.Ess tuning - so for me, although its not big, I've read nothing but great things and how it runs like stock, no need to play around with maps, its just a flash of the original computer software, running a software that they claim is more efficient extracts the best performance possible. The one thing I like about this tuning is the fact that it doesn't disable a lot of safety parameters within the engine to extract more power, as this could put you in a position of heavily damaging your engine without you knowing because safety parameters are turned off. I also don't want to have to change multiple customized maps, the ESS still works alongside the comfort/sports and sports+ modes.I also feel a lot more torque all round, and the torque goes to redline. And a fair bit HP gain after these modification.Wish you the very best, if you want to know anything else with the parts I have installed, let me know or shoot me a PM!\n\nDownpipeUpgraded ICBM3Preferably a custom tune with the BM3. Off the shelf flash maps are a good start but for maximum power/safety better to get a custom tune.\n\n^^^^ what iQuiet said.If you're going to sticking with the stock turbo I'd suggested going for the Wagner EVO1 competition. The EVO2 is much larger volume and therefore presents a bigger pressure drop over the stock IC on stock turbo & tune. The EVO1 is as close to the stock as I've seen.The Fabspeed DP is very good (unlike there exhaust with is terrible). A decat would offers more torque but here in the UK they are not road legal due to emission rules. I've seen very good numbers from the Remus exhaust with a Fabspeed DP and I know the Fi exhaust is very good too. If you do go down the decat then I would highly recommend the Fi decat as it has a very small cat on the O2 sensor to protect it - which is a nice touch i've not seen on the compotition.The Eventuri, IMHO, is a gimmick. Save your money and go for a BMC or ITG drop in air filter.The other thing to consider is to replace the rear diff bushes to help keep all this extra power down. Have a look at the PowerFlex black series bush replacements. I tried the bush inserts but found they sucked so took the decision to replace them with the full bush replacements and been very pleased.In terms of cooling I am waiting on release of the CSF radiator and oils cooler. These are due for release very soon.... my understanding is heatsoak is the No1 killer of power potential from the N55.Lastly, if I may, avoid the tunner boxes. Invest in an real remap specific for your car. You've invest all that money so why waste in on a JB4!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstood. Is it not possible to get an ECU remap compatible with an SPS?My MINI has a customer stage 3 Manic remap and a switch to choose between 3 modes. Mode A is street, Mode B is track and Mode C is ludicrous Mode!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneric hardware branded by whichever tuning company who develops an ECU remap to use one.http://www.lohen.co.uk/shop/gen-2-mi...-switch-detailhttps://www.demon-tweeks.co.uk/perfo...al-port-switch\n\n\n\nBM3 *A MUST*BMC Filter (I had the Eventuri Intake, it just makes sounds)Wagner IntercoolerCatless DownpipeFTP Charge PipesMaybe throw in the PURE hi flow turbo inlet as I didI've got a catback as well for extra sound (Akrapovic)And your car will FLY!\n\nMeth works very well with piggyback.That being said, my recommendation would be a flash tune that's optimal for OCT93 (without meth) and use meth as a cooling and octane bonus. That fits well with your criteria which is safe and clean power, and is not necessarily any less powerful than meth+JB4. This also eliminates the need for map switch on the fly.On this route, you can take a step further to JB4+BEF anytime you starve for more power.\n\n\n\nBM3 + JB4 (for best methanol injection safety and control)DownpipeIntercoolerCharge PipeBMS methanol injection",

    "content": "Auto Talent Review from a friendly forum user.So.. Where do I begin about my journey of purchasing a simple full Frequency Intelligent Exhaust (Catless downpipes, cat-back exhaust + Carbon Tips).24-07-2017At the start the few questions I had, were answered very promptly by the minute by Golan from Auto Talent;During these conversations, I was informed that the lead time was 2-3 weeks.So I made payment in full upfront in promise that the lead time was 2-3 weeks away.Now.. Here is where havoc begins.From this point in, I was chasing constantly as to when the exhaust would arrive and ship, I had replies days later and was told multiple times that they(Auto Talent) were expecting shipment.I had a lot better response from Justin @ Auto talent, he was very prompt and responsive however didnt provide the information that I was requesting as he wasnt my sales person and was adamant that he didnt want to overstep his boundary.I had to constantly request invoice for the purchase (which was then later made out to me 4 days after I had purchased). I wanted this as a proof of purchase.After constantly hassling and pushing to have my shipment sent, I was provided tracking 4 1/2 weeks since my purchase date. I eagerly waited and checked for my shipment, and as soon as it received the shores of Australia; I lodged the custom clearance and duties ($850AUD). just to push the parcel as quickly as I could to my installer SouthernBM as they had put aside tune/intercooler/chargepipes etc for me, and I had originally told them it would be 2-3 weeks from the purchase date and would update them. By the stage it arrived to Australia it was past its 5th week. My company of choice to install/tune etc was quite patient with me, and didnt hold a deposit on the items they were holding aside for me.During this time, I tried to get in contact with Golan to lower the shipment value so I didnt have to pay as much customs duties/taxes. He did so (which was great) but didnt tell me, so our stories couldnt correlate. In a rush, I provided the invoice I received presume Golan didnt receive my email and lower the value of the goods. Which in return cost me $850AUD; rather than a much lower figure if anything.*LACK OF COMMUNICATION*. I did this because I didnt want to hold up my installer any longer, this was 5 weeks since the sale.I finally received the parcel on 29th of August.The parcel came with NO Downpipes. (note: I paid customs and duty on everything) expecting it to come with everything.So I urgently e-mailed Auto Talent(Golan). and multiple times corresponding with NO REPLY. (What kind of customer service is this?)On the 31st of August, I made an international call (I set an alarm for 4AM Australian time; to make sure their shop was opened) all I was told We just shipped what Fi Exhaust had shipped to us (They didnt even check the shipment and goods) and thats it! I said well can you let me know as soon as you know something, he said hell contact Fi Exhaust and update me.So, during the next few days I asked Golan a few questions Example: Was the downpipes compatible with RHD vehicle etc. NO REPLY. I also asked for compensation in some sort (monetary, or additional parts) NO REPLY.My installer has received their shipment of Wagner downpipes and asking me what is going on with Auto Talent, as they assume that Im in Australia that the company doesnt care about any customer that couldnt go on shore and ask whats going on. This is exactly how I felt.On the 7th of September I finally hear something from Golan I have the catless dp ready to ship, I can refund you if you like or ship it. Did you install the system?I replied immediately, that I wanted the dp shipped and that all address remains the same etc. A day later (I try not to bother him too much) I ask if he can provide tracking etc.another day later, I ask if he can keep the value of the dp low; so I dont incur any customs duties and taxes.I ask if he can throw in the app module for Fi Exhaust for free.NONE OF THESE RECEIVED A REPLY.Actually its now the 12th of September and I havent received ANY REPLY. or a refund.What kind of customer service do you call this?Ive paid almost $1,000 in customs duties and taxes due to miscommunication (Lack of their responsiveness).Ive waited almost 2 months coming up now.My installer is asking me what is going on constantly; which I then ask Golan (to NO REPLY).I had a senior fedex tracer get in contact with them to which Golan had stated they didnt ship the goods.Im requesting compensation of some sort, my time and effort is not free. For such a simple exercise I tried my best to make everything go smoothly but this just isnt right.I have everything organised to install and tune on my end. Waited 2 months since I paid in full for the exhaust and still havent received it.Have not been compensated and have not received replies from Golan (Auto talent).TLDR; It feels like Im getting played and after they took my money, they dont care about anything else.How do you guys feel best I resolve this, as clearly their not willing to communicate with myself.I have now received the downpipe.. 2 months after initially ordering it, paying upfront in full. No Compensation or anything, just a short fat, delays happen. Thats it.Any recommendations or opinions are welcomed!\n\nI hate being the hindsight guy, but using PayPal's no payment until delivery sounds like it would've been key here.Thanks for the heads up, i'll be sure to avoid them in the future. Good luck with them, scummy car parts and car people are the worst to deal with.\n\nExtreme Powerhouse has the FI down pipe FYI.....dont need to get from AutoTalent....XPH may also be able to get the exhaust also.\n\n\n\nIt’s amazing how a company’s credibility can be destroyed in no time...\n\nIs AutoTalent the only distributor the OP could have used. I find it surprising that FI doesn't have a dealer in Australia or FI couldn't drop ship to Australia.Delays are pretty common especially if you're passing through two sets of customs\n\nSorry OP you had to go through all that trouble. I agree that there should be some type of compensation (credit, etc).Out of curiosity, how come you didn't purchase from a local FI dealer in your area? Would have been much easier in my opinion. No need for the parts to travel to another country.\n\nTo add anecdotal evidence (and I've never even bought anything from AT), but I have communicated via PM and most of their responses have answered all of my questions and have been very prompt.Definitely planning on doing business with them.\n\n\n\nNothing to complain about with AT. Always great service. Definitely could have been a logistics issue as the amount of ground that package had to cover.Justin.AutoTalent\n\n\n\nSounds like one of those \"anyone can be an auto parts vendor\" aka middleman sales groups. No thanks.\n\n\n\nOP, you have my sympathy and I agree Golan should have done a better job to respond to you.  Having said that, unfortunately delays from mfrs itself is a common place.  A set of custom wheels I ordered directly from a US mfr (built in and delivered to within US) was delayed by a month.  Having to clear multiple customs, in your case, adds even more variables to the delivery time.  While the shipment is in custom, it's out of the vendor's control and they don't know how long it might be held up.  It might be a day; it might be couple weeks.  It's difficult for them to give you an estimated timeline once it's held up longer than the norm.I learned not to plan my schedule around estimated lead time.  If it happens to arrive on time I'd consider it a bonus.  Hope you get everything resolved soon.\n\nIt's awesome to see both brands commenting on this post, but the communication from Golan to you was still unacceptable no matter what was going on with the parts.I get international shipping is a shitshow, but someone should have said that to your buyer. You don't just forget about him/stop responding, especially when you're getting paid to respond to people.Quote:During this time, I tried to get in contact with Golan to lower the shipment value so I didn’t have to pay as much customs duties/taxes.

The customer here clearly doesn't care as much about the product arriving 'late', it's that you didn't tell him it was going to arrive late, or tell him that you plainly were uncertain/unable to tell due to international shipping times varying so much, or you haven't gotten a response yet from the mfc, etc. etc., the problem is you ignored him.This wouldn't have been a forum post if it just arrived late and you didn't ignore him. People understand shit happens, especially in the car world. People don't pay $5,000+ to be ignored.\n\nHonestly zFrostyy has hit it right on the nail, the issue wasn't due to it being delayed, it's the lack of communication, I felt like I had to keep lying to my installers in Melbourne telling them, yes it's coming soon, or I haven't heard back yet, let me try chase them up, as the installers have to book me in as well, I understand delays do happen, but if the communication is free flowing and everyone is on the same page it makes it a more enjoyable experience.And honestly, I purchased through Auto Talent based on their past reviews which were mostly quite stellar.Yes this may be a once off, but it nonetheless was a disappointing experience.If this allows the company to adjust the way they communicate and exempt a fellow member from being left in the complete dark when spending this amount of money on car parts, that would be the goal.I know compensation would be out of the question.\n\n\n\nAndy,I am sorry to see you write this thread. When you purchased this exhaust I let you know the lead time from FI. As I mentioned earlier, we are not in charge of how quickly an exhaust ships from the manufacturer. As the 3 week date approached I let you know that the exhaust has still not shipped and I was waiting for an ETA. It was then when you would keep asking for an update when I did not have one. You then proceeded to contact Justin who had nothing to do with the order just to try and get a faster response. I always give an update to the customer when I hear from the manufacturer. Due to FI being in Taiwan communications can sometimes be a little slower than the customer wants. You would email Sam complaining that you did not receive a response only 2 hours after sending me an email (You yourself apologized for this).You were updated every time I was updated from FI. I apologize if that did not suffice for you but constantly asking for a status update does not speed up the process. I also provided your invoice with a lower value like requested to customs but not fast enough for your liking. I believe our time difference played a factor here and you were just in a little bit of a rush to have it clear customs. On top of all this you know we were in the middle of moving our shop. Moving 10k sf of shop to a new building is not an easy task so that slowed us down as well. You were kept in the loop that we were in the middle of that as well.I'm not saying this transaction could not have gone smoother. It definitely could have but I feel like you are blowing this up a bit much. I apologize you had a bad experience and hopefully if you allow, I will make it up on the next one. You said yourself that you proceeded to go with us because of our stellar reviews. I pride myself on making sure customers are happy with every transaction. Hopefully people who have dealt with me in the past can confirm that. I just feel in this instance you were a little anxious (rightfully so) to install this on your car and you took things the wrong way. Either way, I hope you are enjoying the system and would be happy to take care of you like mentioned before if you give me the opportunity.Golan\n\n@iQuiet I find it hilarious the response times of both Justin and Golan exactly mirror your experience. Justin responds to your post almost instantly and Golan takes a few days (to see it? Justin maybe waited a few days to tell him? Maybe he was on vacation?) and then nearly completely misses the point (and blames you for it?).Come on dude. There were criticisms in here that weren't demanding of an update to the manufacturer. They were asking for communication from you specifically about customs pricing coordination among other things that communication from just you would've sufficed. Did you even read any of the other posts/replies in here before you wrote your response?\n\n\n\nI kind of agree with Golan and Justin here. You went into the purchase order knowing full well of their shop's personal issues with moving, and asking for an update constantly doesn't really speed up the process. My M2 is in the middle of the ocean, me bothering my SA and the manager on a weekly basis isn't going to change the fact that it's in the middle of the ocean.Also, you decided to buy something that had to go through two customs ports just to get to you. Sure, clothing and small articles can get by easily, no problem. The problem is, is when you have a big package upwards of 50LBS, there are going to be hold-ups.

Not only knowing about them or reading articles on magazines, I mean, real life experience ?Please comment, thanks !\n\nForget the Dinan stage 1 piggyback. The Dinan sport tuner will produce the same, if not more, power gains for $300 USD. Stage 1 will match the BMW warranty but the sport tuner looks to be very reliable as I've heard no complaints from anyone, including myself.I'd suggest getting a quality reflash or spending the cash for stage 4 kit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're spending all this money, might as well get a REAL / PROPER / Tune that adjusts all parameters and not plug in sensors to trickThe M2 does not do well when piggybacks are just pushing the boost, it may feel fast but things will start to go downhill afterwards.Call it what you call it, every car is different, 91oct guys especially just upping boost running slower than stockFlash Tune > Piggyback !Not to mention, none of these piggyback have datalogging suite so you're putting a blind tune.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph from G POWER is much more convincing than DINANWhat do you see / think ?\n\n\n\nI have no idea what's the magic in European tunes. All the vendor-provided curves I've seen show very consistent gains throughout the power band with minimal taper if any at fuel cutoff. They spool fast like factory and pull hard like a PS2.As for Dinantronic Stage one, I'm speaking as a previous owner - it also cracks up boost early on and tapers depending on how IAT holds up, nothing like the power curve Dinan published. Do a search here and you'll see that from a few independent dyno plots. The good thing about Dinantronic is the proactive way it works with additional boost. ECU does not have to react and self correct all the time to conflicted signals so the performance is more consistent. However you have to realize there're a few important performance related parameters that piggyback of any kind is not able to touch up or full control at this point, such as timing, AFR(fully), throttle opening, valve overlap & etc. Dinantronic stage one will get you as far as piggyback can reliably make from stock hardware and preferably with upgraded intercooler which I recommend even on stock tune. Downpipe always improves turbo responsiveness and thus makes torque down low. But to make real power out of it you need a flash tune to adjust throttle opening at upper rev range and on overboost.I used Dinantronic Stage One for one month prior to the switch to BM3 because I'm going further with more hardware mods (see my threads). Dinantronic Stage one (upgradeable to stage 4) is for sale. Let me know if anyone is interested. Will ship worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should try a very reputable company called ESS Tuning\n\nAfter seeing the debacle of piggybacks on the Mazda platform vs flash tune I'll never go back to a piggyback on ANY platform.\n\nIf you are looking for power and reliability only, you are looking at the wrong options.You pay extra for Dinan because of their warranty.If this is a concern for you, Dinan is the obvious choice.If you only care about power BM3 or Jb4 will offer more power.\n\n",

A little more induction noise is apparent.But the DINAN Sport Performance Tuner did indeed make a noticeable difference, especially higher up the rev range. Its not a huge gain, but its noticeable under foot. Currently it is set to RACE mode.I had the DINAN Sport Performance Tuner installed for about three weeks before adding the AFe parts.Thing is, I want more power, who doesn't!So I have further plans, I am not looking for stupid power, so my mod list is fairly tame. I think I will only really need a decat downpipe, charge pipe, boost pipe and a better intercooler going forward.To run the decat without CEL, I am going to need either a flash tune or a piggy back like the JB4. I prefer the idea of something like the JB4 as its removable, which is ideal for when I have to return the car.I have been reading about the bootmod3, looks interesting apart from the DME unlock requirement, I think there is only one dealer in the UK that can unlock the DME, thats not ideal for me so I am leaning towards the JB4. Unless of course I can unlock the DME myself!So its looking like my only real option is the JB4.But I am seeing mixed opinions about running the JB4 on the M2.

The reason I'm looking is because a colleague of mine has recently bought a M140i and it bothers me how quick it is against the M2Is this return in power realistic?  Can anyone comment who has experience of these tuning boxes and give me an idea of how they got on with them?Apologies, I'm not 100% in touch with the specifics so if I'm asking a silly question I'm sorry!\n\nI'd just take him on a twisty mountain road and tell him to chase mePiggyback won't do enough imo to humiliate a M140i\n\nIt will be less than that on an M2 , i would say 20-30\n\nSo to update I had the Remus Powersizer fitted on Saturday.All I can say is wow! Quite a big improvement throughout the rev range. It's especially noticeable in 4th and 5th gear pulls from 2000rpm up to the redline. It's considerably quicker. I also went for a pipercross high flow filter too. No real performance gains but just to let the engine breathe a little better than stock.I may find the time at some point to dyno the car to get an idea of power figures. I'm keen to know what the 0-60 time is now - hence my post on the nav/electronics board.\n\nIf I'm not mistaking, Remus is re-branding DTE.Is this how your chip looks like?https://www.chiptuning.com/en/bmw/2-...w-2979ccm.html\n\n\n\nWould you be kind to either go to dyno, and do couple of runs with this box turned off, and dialed?Or at least find some space and do couple of pulls from 100-200 km/h?We would be very curious to see some results?\n\nI still don't get it why people getting a simple box like this for cars like a M2. If you compare it with a good ECU remap, the difference will be huge...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's funny that everybody thinks that when you use a box that you won't lose your warranty. Let's say for example that your turbo's are blowed up, BMW is going to send all the data to Munich, and they will see that car has used a lot more HP and NM than it should be, so you will still lose your warranty...I'm not here for trolling, just giving my own opinion about this.\n\n",

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comBack in August Dinan introduced its initial S1 package for the F87 M2 complete with tune, intake, exhaust, and suspension. However, this initial package was limited from the factory in the power department by an already nearly maxed out turbo. In order to make any real meaningful additional power a new turbo and supporting hardware / tune would be needed.We started down the big turbo path immediately after that August release and offered a sneak peak of the new M2 with all of its prototype hardware at SEMA this past month. With additional testing out of the way since that initial unveiling we are now happy with the tweaked results and wish to unveil this new S2 M2 package to the masses. Now anyone can assemble the package that makes our engineers drool with anticipation for their own beloved M2. The wait for the fully Dinanized M2 is over.Enjoy.Dinan F87 M2 Big TurboPart Number:D310-0110Applications:2016+ F87 M2 CoupeRelease Date:Today, December 22nd, 2016.Product Page - Details /Additional Photos / Pricing:http://www.dinancars.com/product/D31...ries&mid=1243/Description:For the racing enthusiast or those just looking for the best, this is the ultimate upgrade to fully maximize the power output of your F87 M2. In stock form the turbo was essentially at its limit in terms of power production so Dinan is offering a bigger replacement unit so more power can be safely achieved. The compressor wheel inside the turbocharger is increased in size allowing greater flow thus enabling additional boost pressures at higher engine speeds while retaining efficiency. These are rebuilt factory turbos that are machined to Dinan specifications along with an upgraded thrust system to ensure reliable and prolonged life. In order to attain maximum advertised power gains these big turbos will need to be paired with DINANTRONICSStage 4, as well as Dinan's intercooler to fully regulate the boost increase and deliver a polished product although the exhaust and intake are also recommended.Benefits of the Dinan Big Turbo for the BMW F87 M2:Factory turbo that is machined to Dinan specifications with an upgraded thrust system.Larger billet compressor/impeller wheel that allows ~30% greater flow over stock which then enables additional boost to be realized while retaining efficiency.Peak power: 446 HP @ 6500 RPM and 458 ft-lbs @ 4500 RPM with max gains of 101 HP @ 6500 RPM and 86 ft-lbs @ 4500 RPM when coupled with other Dinan Performance upgrades.Dinan Installation instructions detail a procedure which is quicker than BMW's turbo replacement procedure saving the end-user money and time at the shop.Includes o-rings and gaskets needed for complete installation.Factory matching new car warranty (4yr/50k) when run in Dinan specification.50 State Emissions legal; CARB EO # D-176-49.Please Note:Due to incredible demand and limited availability of cores the EWG N55 turbo has a waiting list associated with it. Any new orders will be a minimum of 4 weeks away from fulfillment. We are working as hard as possible to minimize those delays.Core Program:Turbochargers are a part of the CORE program we utilize at Dinan so you will be charged an additional fee on top of MSRP initially. This fee will then be refunded to you once your old turbochargers have been received at Dinan and passed a quality check. This ensures we have a continuous stream of product for rebuilding purposes and the lowest possible price to the consumer. Any cores sent back that are damaged and/or unusable will not be given credit for. Please ensure adequate packaging and packing is being used to protect returning cores.Dinan F87 M2 DINANTRONICS Stage 4Part Number:D440-0049-ST4Applications:2016+ F87 M2 CoupeRelease Date:Today, December 22nd, 2016.Product Page - Details /Additional Photos / Pricing:http://www.dinancars.com/product/d44...ries&mid=1243/Description:While the big turbo allows the additional power to be had, the engine still needs to be tuned to extract that power from the larger turbo. The stage 4 DINANTRONICSPerformance Tuner does exactly that and unlocks an impressive swath of power in the mid-range and top end of the power spectrum. The result is a car that pulls hard all the way to red-line and puts a wide grin on the drivers face.With Peak/Max HP gains hovering around +100, and max torque gains at +80 simply saying the car is being transformed is an understatement. With numbers like those not many statements need to be thrown around. The numbers speak for themselves.Dinan F87 M2 Dual Core IntercoolerPart Number:D330-0026Applications:2016+ F87 M2 CoupeRelease Date:Friday, December 30th, 2016.Product Page - Details /Additional Photos / Pricing:http://www.dinancars.com/product/d33...ries&mid=1243/Description:With a bigger turbo and more boost to elicit greater power gains heat becomes larger issue. More heat in turn robs some of the power you just gained. A larger high performance intercooler combats the heat and those power gains are protected. The Dinan dual core intercooler provides a 278% increase in face area along with an equally impressive increase in volume, substantially reducing the pressure drop to 0.8 psi, as well as providing for more efficient heat exchange and more consistent output power. Dinan's unique dual core design allows 2 separate cores to be working in conjunction with one another at all times. This doubling of resources is directly responsible for a 39% improvement in the delta from charge air temperature to ambient temperature (See diagrams below). \"Cool down\" time is also significantly reduced, enabling the cars to produce full power under varying driving conditions such as stop and go traffic. This leaves the chances of being susceptible to heat soak nearly a thing of the past.The system has been engineered to be as direct a replacement as possible to the stock unit, requiring only minor modifications for a clean, factory-like installation. The increased thermal efficiency provided by the Dinan dual core intercooler will also enhance turbocharger reliability in addition to overall power.Benefits of the Dinan Dual Core Intercooler for the F87 M2:Max gains of 7 HP and 5 lb-ft of torque on a stock car.Face area  278% larger than the stock intercooler setup for maximum cooling efficiency to deter heat soak.Charge Air Pressure drop: 0.80 PSI (69% improvement over stock)Charge Air Temperature drop: 193º F (9% improvement over stock)Charge Air Temperature / Ambient Temperature Delta: 25º F @ 6250 RPM (39% improvement over stock)\n\n\n\nTime to max out the CC.\n\nSo I was starting to feel worried about the stock M2 with all this LCi, CS, talk....well here's my answer\n\nSo it's 10% off right now for $9,418.50 and there is a $1,500 core charge.  Does the total price reflect the core charge or is it above and beyond the $9,418.50?\n\n\n\n\n\nI wonder how much a left nut is going for these days?\n\n\n\nSo $4,253 for the Big Turbo, IC, and Software (after the core refund). Not too bad.\n\n\n\nWhat am I missing here... this thread suggests about $9400 while the Dinan site lists $6000 when I look at the P2 power package with the same hp and torque gains.\n\n\n\nFor those on the fence about getting the exhaust and intake because they are not needed for stage 4, I would say to spend the extra dough. Both components are terrific, especially the exhaust coupled with the resonator delete. It's vicious sounding throughout the entire rev range with cold start being downright offensive. You'd be hard pressed to find a better sounding FI car.\n\nSo gains with 93 oct, what about us who only have 91? Anymore room with some e85?\n\nNot to shaby at all. Was expecting 500hp from a big turbo but for $4k I think its well worth considering it comes with warranty. Curious to see us who have a catless dp, pure hiflow inlet pipe, and some E85 juice will pull on the dyno.Whats the install time for the turbo and tune??\n\nYESSSSS. Sorry bank account.\n\n\n\nAbout time!  I've been waiting for this all month!  Now, how to pay for it??\n\nLet's see...figuring Baby Gurl will be in storage until Mid-March...4 week lead time on the turbo order...Valentines Day will have new meaning this year! Apologies to the wifey!\n\nDoes BMW require Dinan equipment to be installed by a Dinan dealer for warranty purposes?  Or, can I DIY this and keep my warranty?\n\nCan the intake and intercooler be installed without a tune? Will it increase turbo lag? I will eventually get the turbos and tune as well, but I want to spend sometime on the track with stock power first. It would be great if I can run the intake and intercooler first without the tune for a few months and then have the turbos and tune installed. I am just worried about turbo lag.",

It would have to sit off to the side.\n\nSupercharger will take power to make power, It will be heavier and would probably require a hood modification. With VGT/DVT turbo's torque is there from a little above 1K rpms with lag almost being non-existant.A turbo is easier to change/tune out inefficiencies as new modifications are installed.I had a compound turbo set up with a supercharger on my CTD. Different, expensive and just a lot of headache....but it looked majestic.\n\n\n\nModern superchargers use about half a horsepower while cruising and make way more than they lose.

As I remember, there was one time I noticed water in my MPE (V1) muffler, though a few hour driving made it go away. This drain hole would be helpful where it's rainy most of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamn. I should have gotten my dealer to try and get me the V2 replacement instead of welding it\n\nI have the V2 MPE on my car and still get the rattle/vibration on cold start.

Placing in Sport + mode doesn't seem to make a difference.My question is whether there is a way to keep the cold startup sound 20-30 seconds after startup.I am running a stock exhaust system.Thanks.\n\nNo, that is the engine cold starting and as the idle dies down the sound goes away. I guess you could unlock the ECU and have the idle rpm changed and fueling, but realistically just get an exhaust or downpipe. I'll sell you my GThaus exhaust. It's nasty all the time lol.\n\n\n\nUnderstand but the change I'm hearing is a not gradual change but a distinct step change like a valve is opening or closing - about 20-30 seconds after a cold start.\n\n\n\nSecondary air injection. it's for emissions. heats the cat quicker.\n\nI'm selling my Remus Exhaust, it'll give you a nice start up sound! Brand new tips, and only about 35 miles on the exhaust.\n\nThe missus is complaining that when the M2 starts up in the garage, which shares a wall with the kitchen where we hang all our cooking utensils, everything is clanging and vibrating.

A proper dyno will always compensate for temp and humidity, but for reference this was a 90 degree day with high humidity :\n\nSo it looks like BMW has significantly detuned the euro model, unless I am missing something.\n\n\n\nonly 337 bhp :s god... BMW used to downl play specs, maybe not anymore... or could it be the ron 93 fuel screwing this over ?\n\nCrank vs RWHP?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbobertcan't help you with the dyno specifics like you mentioned but i know this much about 'rolling road' dyno's:- different typ's of dyno's (eddy current, hydraulic, etc) results can't be compared directly- dyno's only measure at the wheels (except if it bolts directly to the drive shafts)- dyno crank/flywheel numbers are calculated based on measured drive train resistance. (this would be measured during the coast downs after a pull as far as i understand)- as can be seen fromTwtslip, multiple pulls are necessary to get a representative average. Twt's torque already has a 5% spread across the runs.- i don't know how they get the engine RPM but if that's calculated based on dyno rpm (=wheel RPM), gear ratio's and tire sizes introduce another small error. But maybe they get it another way?- i think power cannot be 'measured' directly but is the result of the torque at certain RPM (power = torque * angular velocity) and can be calculated knowing torqe and rpm can be or extrapolated from the acceleration rate.The result will reuse tolerances and errors in measurements again, even 'double' if RPM is also calculated.- OEM specs are at the crank, i would assume from an engine dyno standalways tricky to compare.krizze's result look to match what he paid for (albeit on RON 100 gas, RON 98 gas is required to match BMW's specs as stated in europe)\n\n\n\nCan't compare different dynos.  Expect the M2 to range from 320-370s whp and 340-400 wtq.Put these cars back to back on the same dyno, same day and I bet the numbers vary by only +/- 5.\n\nThis thread is screwed. Join the rest of the world a little bit please American...It's so perfectly normal to use HP/PS and NM in the same dyno plot anywhere outside of NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hey fellas,Been a long time lurker, finally about to pull the trigger on a LCI 6mt. I am not new to the tuning world, but new to turbo BMWs. Previously owned 2 race-prepped S2000s, 370Z (garbage), and tracked a buddy's E92 M3 6mt from time to time. The overwhelming reviews of the M2 finally broke me haha.I'm seeing that ecu mods (jb4 for instance) don't benefit the M2 as well as the regular 335 /340s. It seems like 335 / 340 crowd sees crazy (unheard of in the NA world) gains while the M2 sees mild increase in power. Given that they are both using N55 engine (few different internals on m2), what explains this discrepancy? Obviously im set on the M2 but was curious on why this is.Thanks for all ur help!\n\nWelcome to the clubA simple put:M2 has basically a stronger and cooler N55 that is tuned from factory to a higher power state, or maxed out as some like to say. You can say BMW has done most of aftermarket jobs.There is little left on the table with stock hardwares. You won't be seeing meaningful gains until upgrading downpipe and intercooler.Hope it helps.\n\nIt is the same engine but the M2 is tuned more aggressively which leaves little room for more boost on stock cars\n\nFuel pump is also another major constraint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngot it. Thanks guys for the info!\n\nThe best way to boost up the power a little bit, add a nice little sound to the car, and just overall have some more fun in your M2 is to go with a catted downpipe - especially our Sport Cat. There is no doubt in my mind that it is the best first/overall modification you can do to your M235/335/435/M2. There are plenty of threads to back that up as well.If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and I would be happy to help!\n\nMy 08 135i with intercooler, down pipe, chargepipe and JB4 actually honks. I need to see how my M2 PE runs against it. So far the 135i seems crazy fast compared to the stock M2. Just sayin!\n\nHow much HP does the JB4 gain for the M2?  Their website shows 60hp to 100hp at the wheels for the F series cars, not sure about specific numbers for M2.\n\nI'd be surprised to see any more than 25 whp out of a stage 1 ots tune. Seems like dp and fmic is the way to go bang for r buck until you start talking turbo.\n\nThe M2 is very fun for someone who is track focused like you. I would encourage you to try it on stock form before worrying about tune and power options. If you been lurking you know the M2's capability with FBO.",

Do you plan on a downpipe?\n\nWhat're your goals for the car as well? Do you just want it to sound great or do you want more power out of it also? Do you plan on more modifications down the road? A downpipe is going to be your biggest friend in this situation.Check your PMs! I'd love to chat more with you and make sure you are properly guided in the right direction.\n\nI like the sound of the sound of both so it's difficult for me to single out exactly what it is I like. But I can say I don't like the sound of akrapovic (no offense to anyone who does). I think I need to hear them in person to get a sense of how loud I want to go but I definitely don't want to get a ticket here in California.As far as the down pipe goes I'm interested in possibly getting a catted one but again because I'm in the strictest emission state in the world I'm afraid of voiding a warranty or getting into trouble.

    "content": "As I've noted in a few threads I was debating between BM3/pure and Dinans stg4 large turbo upgrade. In the end I went the Dinan route as I believed the power increase and overall performance was going to leave me satisfied. Prior to install I was running jb4 with 2 gallons of e85 which per my butt dyno gave me a nice bump in power.Currently my 6spd mt M2 has a catless DP, Dinan exhaust, Dinan intercooler, dinantronics and of course the large turbo. Before I give my opinion I want to first say these are my own personal results and in no way trying bash either company.After the install was complete I was pretty eager to let it rip on the hwy. When I first turned it on it sounded great. Strong idle, no surge, and at moderate revs I can hear the turbo sing a bit. Was truly excited at this point and for $6 I was expecting a very notable difference. One thing I want to note is I kept my jb4 on to clear my cel and for logging purposes only. So jb4 was kept on map 4 only. As I began driving I found no issues at all and mid rev transitions into gears were all fine.Finally managed to get onto the hwy after I filled her up with 94 octane I was sure ready to give it a go. I did a few 3rd, 4th, and 5th gear pulls when I began to notice the changes.Per Dinan the upgrade should of yielded 101hp and 86lbs of torque from stock at 4500rpm.30min later into my drive it was obvious to me the power jump was not much of an increase per my butt dyno. DYNO?? Not yet as it's been raining quite frequently lately but plan on it very soon.I was sure of myself that perhaps it wasn't set on stg4. Called Dinan up and they made sure my software was upgraded and double checked I was on stg 4per Dinan app. I had a few more chances where I had compete open roads to test the power band. Is there a difference? Sure, I can feel a bit more pull mid range and it becomes apparent in the higher gears. But to say it's night and day well again this is my opinions and I say no there isn't.So, what will I do? I've decided to take it into Dinan and have them take a real good look at it all and run it on thier dyno to confirm numbers.Otherwise guys, stay tuned as I will give more feedback as I may have an issue which can correct the power or lack thereof.\n\nI'm all over this one.  I have a Stage 4 kit ready to install. When will you be able to leave it with Dinan?You should feel the difference Dinan has published, with no \"maybe\" or \"kind of\" involved.\n\n\n\nWhat made you go with Dinan?  I'm sure a lot of people are in the same dilemma.....Dinan vs Pure\n\nI went with Dinan for a handful of reason.Went with Dinan because of the simplicity of there set up plain and simple. Keeping my warranty sure that's a plus but not to concerned about that. Also, because I was already using or planned on using many of their products which again goes with simplicity.\n\nany updates? i've been reading up on the dinan packages and i came across your posts. i appreciate the way you've been honest and seemingly impartial about your results. i'm still interested in getting the dinan exhaust and res delete but if the power gains are not that dramatic i won't be able to justify the cost.\n\n\n\nthanks for the quick reply!now i just have to figure out how much of a difference the sport cat made since i'm too chicken to mess with the warranty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeanWRTBimmer28312let me know if you guys are selling your dinantronics sport tuners\n\n\n\n\n\n",

What you see below is an editor that will come up for any bm3 user when/if they wish to take things into their own hands, or, work with a tuner of their choice.For those comfortable enough to have fun in the editor you'll have access to close to 300 tables to adjust all of the tune aspects we also tune with for our OTS maps. Every table we touch will be part of the editor. Any new advances made will also be exposed to the editor on an ongoing basis.On the tuner front, we've built a feature into it to allow the end user to send their stock or tuned map to a registered tuner of their choice. Any current licensed bm3 user can register themselves to be a tuner. Those without an existing BM3 license will also be able to purchase a tuner specific license which doesn't require a DME unlock of their own car to offer assistance in tuning any given bm3 user seeking out their help.More to follow on that very soon.

MDM adopts even comfort valve setting where valve is closed at idle and lower rpms.You can use JB4 or Awron to keep it permanently open but you will not get hidden burble outside of MDM.The only way to do this is a flash tune that adjusts ignition strategy so burble aggressiveness is increased.\n\nJb4 and BMS can flap module can leave the valves open all the time\n\n\n\nI believe someone mentioned on this site that the flap is always open in Sport +.\n\nhttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1394397",

    "content": "Hi All, OK, so Im getting ready to pull the trigger on buying the Dinan Sport Tuner.  I already have the Fabspeed catted DP.  My only hesitation is with that nagging worry about reliability and possibly damaging the engine.  What are your thoughts on relative safety for the engine with the following conditions:-\tDinan Sport Tuner set on Sport+(not Race)-\tFabspeed Catted DP-\tOtherwise 100% stock car-\t92 octane fuel-\tSeattle driving where temps rarely get above 90-\tMostly just commuting in the car with some spirited blasts on freeway onramps and the like when traffic gaps allow-\tNot tracking carI'm probably being overly cautious here but this is my first BMW, I LOVE IT, and I just don't want to mess things up.Thanks all!\n\nHi,100% safe, high flow cats is actually safer on your turbos than stock restrictive catsWe have Dinan sport in stock\n\nThis combo is probably the safest way and  best bang for your buck. I will probably do the same thing when my M2 comes. I don't like catless, especially the smell associated with it.\n\n\n\nI have this. Drives 100% like stock. Feels like 400hp from BMW.I had the VRSF DP. Sounded amazing but if you're used to high performance cars you can feel a notch of drivability go out the window. The car became slightly sluggish off the line, poor idle etc.None of those issues with Fabspeed. I am very happy with it and the sport tuner.\n\nI'm thinking about the sport tuner as well since I already have the Fabspeed downpipe. Probably gonna add an intercooler also.\n\nExcellent.  Thanks for the feedback everyone.  Much appreciated!\n\nSo I decided to take the plunge and pick up a Dinan Sport Tuner from Mike at X-PH.  $299, a 5% online discount code, and free shipping.  Can't beat that!  Mike was super helpful; he got right back to me with pricing, even on a Sunday.Hopefully I'll have it in hand by this coming weekend so i can install and give it a try.  I know some of you other guys are considering buying one so I'll post my thoughts here once its installed.\n\n\n\nI recently went full on stage 2 ecu tune.I will sell my old unit for $200, PM if interested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: When down shifting in sport + twice now my car has done so aggressively out of no where in D. Like 4-3 (fine 2000rpm); 3-2 (fine at 2000 rpm). 2-1 (3700 rpm) with a huge rev out of no where. No I was not flooring it before hand, no I didn't accidentally hit the paddle (the car was still in D when and after it happened) and no I was not stopping hard. The sudden harsh downshift felt like a slam on the brakes and seat belts had to hold me in place. Sport has 0 issues. I have a feeling it's related to the combination as it didn't start until now. I will keep everyone posted though as this just started and seems random at the moment\n\nYou are 110% good to go on that. I had a customer in here a little while ago with that setup and he absolutely loved it!\n\nHey all, just checking back in now that I have about 1 month on my Fabspeed catted DP and a week on the Dinan Sport Tuner.  It's perfect.  No CEL, the sound is amazing, and the car now has the power it feels it should have had all along.  I feel like this is the performance that the M engineers probably wanted to give the car but the marketing people pulled back from so as not to get too close to the M4.I seriously could not be happier with the upgrades.Big shout out to Mike from XPH for lining up the Sport Tuner for me.  XPH offered free shipping and a 5% off coupon on their website, so, that's pretty tough to beat.  The install was a snap.  As other folks have commented, it took me longer to decide on wire routing and ziptie placement than it took to connect the thing.My only gripe is with the Dinan iOS app interface.  It gives no feedback as to which mode you are in or have selected.  it's not a big deal to me as I wanted it in Sport+ and thats what it comes set to from the factory.  So basically I downloaded the app, F'd around with it for about 5 minutes, and have not touched it since.Anyway, if anyone is on the fence about a catted DP and the Dinan Sport Tuner, I'd say take the plunge and do it.  it's under $1,500 for the pair and man does it wake this car up!\n\nHow about the dinantronics stage 2 with the dinan air intake and the fabspeed sport chatted down pipes any issues with that configuration and will it make a big difference??\n\n\n\n\n\nThe harsh downshifts have not occurred again since last reported so I would say it's okay. I can't imagine a manual transmission would be affected as this combo from an engine perspective feels strong. I run the Dinan Sport mode (+2 PSI) as I'm in FL with no upgraded IC but I work from home and rarely drive during the hot mid day so this setup is fine for right now.\n\nOP have you dyno'd your car? Curious what the sport cat and dinan added.",

So far we have been focused more on the visual aspect of the vehicle, improving the looks and aerodynamics with RKP Carbon Fiber and KW Suspension. Now that we have the vehicle looking the way we like, naturally the next thing to do was performance upgrades. To free up the flow of exhaust and add a signature sound to the N55 Twin turbo straight 6, we opted for the Armytrix Valvetronic exhaust system.Enjoy the new videos and pictures posted below. This vehicle has been amazing to work with and has a ton of opportunity for modification.

    "content": "So I have never posted before but thought it was a good time! I own both an M4 and an M2. I have MSR intakes on both and could not be happier! The product itself is a piece of well crafted art! The amount of time George(@M6beast) spends on making it perform to the highest levels is truly amazing! The performance is unmatched and the sound is unreal! I can't argue up against any another system cause I have not personally run them on my cars but I do know from hearing others that I picked the perfect intake for me! Everyone has their own opinions and their own styles and the MSR intake is certainly the only intake I would recommend!\n\nNot sure if botched product promotion or a genuine attempt to share a good productRegardless... 4,000$ for an intake that does little to nothing unless combined with other bolt-ons and a tune doesn't really sound like a good bang for your buck imo\n\n\n\nBeautiful piece indeed! And I have been following his development since day one of the M2 Intake! Was very eager to see results on Dyno. And had $ at hand to order immediately once numbers were released.Stock car vs only MSR Intake.And also Intake on a car with a couple mods to see how it played with the added mods.Was very interested in IAT comparisons of stock vs MSR IntakeSadly no numbers have been released. Sound is amazing on the videos but some of us are in search of also measurable improvements.I think I saw your post on IG, nice choice of color.I grew impatient on waiting for #'s and decided going a different route.\n\n!\n\nyes pics for the ppl that dont have IG .\n\n\n\n\n\nF2X Factory intake is about as optimal as a closed system can be. F87 adopts MPPK approach coming as a half open system with a hole open at bottom half, the cooler area of engine compartment, a good balance between flow capacity and heat isolation.A completely open system is essentially trading IAT for flow capacity, with which some of bigger turbo builds will find gains from some point on before heat soaked, and the rest should see power lost more or less, sucking hotter air all the time.There are already a few well designed expensive F87 systems out there, open or close. However, at this point none of them live up to the advertised gains even on dyno.\n\nAftermarket intakes on stock turbo late model BMWs are snake oil and cause all sorts of annoying driveability issues.  Dyno after dyno have shown this.  If you want induction noise, cut open more of the lower airbox.\n\nI'd be afraid to run that in the rain. Almost as bad as the Dinan E36 intake design that was essentially a water puddle vacuum.\n\nI run an ITG panel filter, I think a panel filter in the stock system is great. If I had to spend my money I would buy the the Dinian system\n\ncould an intake cause a rough idle? Like the RPMs fluctuate about 70 RPM and you can hear the exhaust getting louder and softer too.\n\nI'd be scared to drive that in heavy rains. filter seems way too exposed\n\nSub'd for pics and pricing",

    "content": "I am not sure if anyone covered this, I was wondering why a lot of people now said car manufacturers are using back traditional auto gearbox due to DCT can't handle bigger torque.Yes, you can see Audi is using ZF 8-speed for their new S4/S5 and also in RS6/RS7.But I wonder why Porsche is using their PDK dual clutch gearbox for all their cars, even 911 turbo S which definitely got huge torque.Is the new M5 x-drive are still using DCT?\n\nhttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1376991I don't think torque handling is the issue. Rather, cost, weight, shift speed and economy for auto will eventually beat DCT.\n\n\n\nAnd weight.\n\n\n\nICthanks\n\n\n\nI'm not an engineer but there is no way someone could convince me that any automatic could shift faster than Porsche's PDK-S. The GT3 RS is telepathic in it's shifts - always, always where it should be and can move b/w gears so fast it's seamless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGT2 RS makes 700 HP and 553 lb-ft of torque and uses a dual clutch gearbox. Many modified Nissan GT-Rs are making huge power on DCT gearboxes (with upgraded clutch packs).It's purely a cost move. Maybe also the fact that DCT is not quite as refined as a ZF auto box from a stop.Just like that nonsense from Frank van Meel about the manual transmissions not handling the torque. C7 Z06 makes 650 lb-ft of torque through a Tremec MT that, generally speaking, is regarded as shifting better than BMWs long throw sloppy MTs. There will not be an M3/M4 approaching that figure for a long time, if ever.Again, they probably mean cheaply.Journalists have low standards. The Giulia QV and other BMW competitors have had these lazy, sloppy, high latency (from paddle pull) shifting transmissions and barely get penalized in reviews for them. I just watched a C7 Grand Sport review video and you could hear the delay between the click and the shift. BMW must feel like they are spending the money for no reason. Plus then they get the soccer mom complaints about no creeping or the way the transmission engages when you roll onto the throttle...",

    "content": "We've spent the last few weeks designing our M2 exhaust and I'm happy to say that we've begun building our prototype. We put a lot of thought in to the exhaust design and wanted to build something that would be extremely functional without sacrificing aesthetics or sound quality.RequirementsFree flowing design100% Stainless constructionRetain all OEM chassis bracesSmooth soundOEM Valve controlFlawless fitmentQuad tip design (we will be using our 90mm double walled brushed or black tips)As stated above, we plan to keep the OEM valve motor, but with a twist! I can't release full details yet but we will be using the valve system. We will also be seamlessly mating our exhaust to our downpipe. The exhaust diameter will not shrink below 3.5\" from the turbo back! The OEM downpipe (and all other aftermarket downpipes) taper down to a ~3\" diameter pipe where the stock exhaust connects. Our downpipe will be modular, and will be sold with a straight 3.5\" link pipe to mate to our Signature exhaust system or with an adapter pipe to connect to the OEM exhaust system. The idea is that when using our downpipe and full exhaust system, you will have a true 3.5\" turbo back system with zero backpressure and high exhaust velocity!I will update this thread as we make progress on the system, and I will be glad to answer any questions as well!We are also using a true 3\" valve (as opposed to the OEM 2.5\") that utilizes the OEM valve motor!**Update 7/6/16**We've now completed 3 different variations of the rear muffler and still have not settled on a sound that we find acceptable. We've been playing with a few different mufflers to try and find the perfect combination so that the car is extremely aggressive with the valve open but also tame enough with the valve closed to keep your neighbors happy.Today we're trying another variation and I personally have high hopes for this setup. I'll update as soon as it's complete.Keep in mind that our car has a catless downpipe installed, but we're also considering the sound level for cars with catted downpipes. We WILL find that happy medium!Here's a couple shots of some progress.\n\nmore...\n\nWill running the car with a catless downpipe without a tune be dangerous for the engine? The elimination of back pressure doesn't mess everything up?I'm scared now to run a downpipe without a tune adjusting for the difference in pressure etc it makes.\n\nI am sold already! Take my money\n\nyou should build a race version also, catless muffler, ceramic coat optional\n\nWill you sell a sport-catted downpipe option that won't throw a CEL?  Will the MPE CF diffuser mate with this exhaust?\n\n\n\nany news?\n\n\n\nOriginal post has been updated!\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the stock system have flex joint somewhere?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're pretty much finalized with the design, but we'll be making a few changes to the pipe routing for the production units. Sound will be the same. I really think that with our full 3.5\" design and dual 3\" routing to the tips along with our 3\" valve (as opposed to the OEM 2.5\") our exhaust will support upwards of 600whp without any restrictions. Please ignore the tip fitment, we cut and welded 6 different configurations to test sound and didn't focus on tip alignment since we weren't sure if we'd be keeping the configuration. They will fit perfectly on production units.\n\nI will also admit that the exhaust system is louder in person. It's defintely on the loud side with the valve open, and similar to the stock exhaust with catless downpipe when closed. We wanted to make the system sound great with or without a catless downpipe, without being too quiet or too loud.\n\n\n\n",

Can someone confirm this for me?\n\nConfusing the M2 for a 458What you can do though is hit the push-down threshold via the accelerator pedal, which will downshift you into the lowest possible gear given your speed/RPM.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "I had the upgrade installed two weeks ago, but since they had issues loading the software, I wanted to give the ECU a chance to adapt just in case it needed it. 93 octane, Fabspeed 200 cel, Eventuri intake. On his dyno, that computes to 466.85. I also installed the Dinan coilovers that truly transforms the handling. Very happy with my investment. Dinan, for me, is worth every dollar. Quality engineering and development ain't cheap!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tune feels very OEM, doesn't it? Similar turbo lag compared to stock, perhaps even less with the DP but it pulls seamlessly hard to just about redline. It's a long shot but I'm hoping Dinan releases a stage 5 tune that increases the hp/tq by just a smidge while still being compatible with our hardware. I've grown quite comfortable with the added ~100 bhp.As it pertains to the coilovers, I've considered them but feel the stock suspension is good enough for spirited street driving. Additionally, the M2 has very little wheel gap from the factory unlike the M3/4. BMW still hasn't resolved that eyesore in the car's 4th year of production.What exhaust are you running?\n\n\n\nThese look like stock turbo numbers.I have the following,ER catless DPER Intercooler with TIC and chargepipeDinan full exhaustDinan intakeRktunes flashIts not my dyno below, but a similar modded m2 without IC put down these numbers over a jb4.  I expect 375whp and 420wtq on a local dynojet.\n\nDinan tune is a tad less aggressive than many other tunes, and the Dinantronics adjust more parameters for safety. Clearly you can get much higher levels with others. I like the comfort of warranty coverage so I'm satisfied with the numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoc, if i recall correctly, you like your track days.  It looks like the dinan \"coilovers\" are just adjustable spring perches with stiffer springs.Why did you shy away from the BMW Motorsport coilovers which include double adjustable shocks?  I understand they are a grand more, but judging from your beautiful house and car collection that extra grand wouldn't be a concern.BTW, great results and thanks for the write up.\n\nThanks for sharing the info on the build!! Must feel nice!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds like the best of both worlds.How does the spring gives a softer ride around town but less lean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich flows better on a EWG n55? IC+DP+Turbo Inlet, or IC+Stg1(Dinan) turbo?Inlet picks up some efficiency from compressor end and dp removes a lot restriction at turbine side, while Dinan bigger turbo uses enlarged compressor to improve efficiency at higher boost. So it's hard to tell how they compare right?Stage 4 kit (turbo+IC) would have put down 360-365whp(DCT) on stock downpipe. This is a bold idea - you probably will run stage 4 software just fine with IC+DP+inlet pipe, on stock turbo. And I have a feeling dp+inlet combo can make very close power to bigger turbo alone.That being said, that's unless Dinan turbo with compressor tweak really flows 30% more than a EWG turbo, as advertised.",

Thoughts?\n\nWhat is it with this obsession with power ratings between cars?You can cram as much power into a car as you want, doesn't mean it'll drive any better. Just go ask Lotus.\n\nUnless you're drag racing the car, the difference will feel negligible on roadPlus, let's not forget that the M2 is a small coupe... too much power will make it unstable and ruin the ride\n\nLove the n55,  why do many seem anxious for something else?\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1372167\n\nThe M2 is a perfectly balanced car, a throwback to Ms of yesteryear - General ConsensusOMG can we put a newer or bigger engine in it for more power???? - The Confused\n\n\n\n\n\nB58 is certainly a better motor than the N55. You guys are just demonstrating confirmation bias. I have a September delivery of an M2 but I can still recognize an amazing motor. When (not IF) it finds its way into the M2, we'll see lots of tuning headroom thanks to a motor that runs fundamentally cooler and has a bigger turbo.\n\n\n\nHere's the thing....even if they shoved a B58 in the M2 with the same power level, you think most people would notice ANY difference? Probably not. Unless you plan on upping the power yourself you're not missing anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nX4 M40i essentially has close to the same output, 10hp less and no overboost, but damn it drives nice. Kind of unbelievable for that kind of a vehicle. Understeers a little too much though.\n\n\n\nDude, I'd drive a Lada if it bought me pizza\n\nBalance theory doesn't apply here.10+ years ago F430 was just as quick as m2 is today in a drag. At the moment it's  regarded as the car in perfect balance. Until 458 came.If m2 is in less need for power, funny how could pedestrian(comparatively speaking) compact sedan and SUV need more power?BMW fails big time not putting a B58 turbo into M2 N55, all it takes are 1) matching a turbofold that fits and 2) ask supplier to make a 15% bigger intercooler. They're really expensive from a material management perspective, but after all the no love, M2 deserves at least that, doesn't it? No mention, R&D in tuning a bigger turbo N55 would be even easier - same power achieved with less boost, less maxed out, less reliability problems.Damn, I own a m2.\n\nAh, the, if a little is good, then a lot must be better theory. Having owned a few 5 and 600 to cars, balance is the key to the m2. Bigger turbo, more lag. More boost, more fuel. Goes on and on. Change enough things and it becomes a different car. Loses some magic\n\nFor all those getting pissy the OP has a valid point. It's not the engine code or power rating it's the performance. The X3 M40 whatever it's called, M my ass, does 0-60 in 4.6s. Staggering performance for a 4000 plus pound vehicle. I love my M2 but it's not blowing away any X3. In fact the performance gap is so tight that there are many other BMWs Audis and MBs it ain't blowing away either.

    "content": "Hello guys!,So I got my baby back in November, and I wanted a liltle bit more power, who doesnt, and I decided to install the Dinan Stage 1 on it, mainly because of the warranty and reliability by it, i did it, But just now after the break-in period I was able to actually test the car to verify the installed upgrade and see with my eyes the gains.I have been taking withSeanWRTsince he was interested by it, and kinda pushing me to do it haha, anyhow I was gonna do it for my interest.So here are my results, the dyno was Dyno Dinamics Dynamometer:Last But not least the Air-Fuel RatioMy end results were:Stock: Max 314.9 WHP rounds to 370.47 HPDinan tuner Max: 332.9 WHP rounds to 391.64HPFuel: 93 OctaneAs far as I know, the dyno guy told me that there is some weird stuff with the Stage 1 that I have, after it past the 4900 rpm mark, the Dinan STG 1 is actually making less HP than stock, not only that but my AFR is jumping like crazy, and I have to give Dinan a call about this to see what's going on with it, because if the car cant handle the requested increase it should at least hold on to the stock HP, not go below it. And the car is doing that to protect itself.But its clear that at the start its actually giving more power to the car and holding it.here is a reference regarding Dinan Stage 1 results, and how mine should look likeNow Im not an expert on this, I have to admitits my 1st dyno test, but with these results maybe you can take a look, and guide me, it's worth the shotOh yeah, And the camera on the 1st picture, well you should know it, haha my baby was the main surprise on the garage, and one guy was all like, can I take pictures. I was like yes, sure why not haha\n\nLooks like you would see higher results by installing their SPORT Performance Tuner device per other members dyno results.Send them logs from dyno shop, an keep us posted what did they told you.\n\nJosepi, I don't see how Stage One make 334WHP from your graph. It's a 309WHP Dinan curve overlaid with 315WHP stock. Please post the 334whp run if you have.Dinan_Engineeringclarified me a few weeks back that little to no difference should be seen below 2500rpm just so the drivability is maintained. Boost only starts to be apparent from 3000rpm and peaks at 5500rpm before tapering down to redline, though horsepower for the last 1500rpm will be the same.My observation and thoughts. Data log if you have, would be useful to see what's really going on.1) The torque delta is significant down low, nothing like Dinantronic is supposed to make. My guess is the overboost (factory feature, from 1400-5500, 3 psi worth) didn't kick in with your stock run (see how smooth stock curve is), which can explain the huge difference.BTW, Jb4 cars run much smoother when MAF is unplugged to disable overboost. These piggyback would be much less 'confused' when DME boost target is stable.2) From AFR plot, 4000~5400rpm is where Dinan runs leaner and torque goes below stock. The car is running stock fuel mixture on boost during that time under high IAT (well, out tiny little stock intercooler...), DME detected (soft) detonation and pulled timing, leading to power loss. From 5500rpm, overboost(factory feature) disabled, the power goes much below stock.3) From 5700rpm, DME is happier with less boost and timing starts to recover, the power go back up and is close to stock from 6300rpm. But timing loss in mid range just hurts too much for boost over stock to compensate for.\n\nWell the dyno guy was the one that told me on that dinan run, that reads 309 whp, at start on the lower rpm it actually making more like it should but it quickly dissapear in the mid to high range, giving that end result, much less than stock. Although probably im wrong since in noob at rhis thats why i posted the graphs.Also, total noob question here, i believe we run it on comfort mode, but with manual gears and push it. Since i have a DCT. Does that makes a difference, or could be the cause of the problem with the STG 1? Not sure ifDinan_Engineeringdid it like that.Im not sure but would like to know. Other than that everything is stock on the car just the stg 1.\n\n\n\nGuys, probably my 332.9whp reading is my misinterpretation of the graph, i mean at start it does have a high hp, but like the dyno guy told me the real reading is actually 309whp which is as you saySeanWRTis actually making less than stock, even if i have higher hp at start.And yes, i did the breakin service at 1205 miles, like they told me. After that the car behaves like a beast, but on paper sith does numbers i feel kinda sad withthe dinan stg 1 unless something is really mess up\n\n\n\n\n\nI would contact Dinan about it .. .Something is not functioning correctly\n\nHow many miles driven between stock vs tuned runs?  Usually that matters as ECU needs to adapt.\n\nWhat we are seeing here is an ecu that is fighting against a  piggyback... It's confused. The drop at 4500 is most likely due to timing pull and increasing IAT due to the piggy back trying to constantly  ramp up the boost - ecu doing this as it's getting lied to- in order to maintain its targets,  the car heat soaks,  timing pulls,  and a subsequent loss of power. It's really as simple as that. I seen IATs of 80deg C on 2 runs with an outside air temp of 6 degrees c... It's a completely different story on the road though as the air coming in and IAT is easier to maintain.\n\nThis is interesting..\n\nthat sucks...\n\nDisregarding the above-described dips probably resulting from the timing being pulled...generally speaking, it shows the limit of the turbo. You can makes gains in the midrange, but there's nothing left up top, at least with the factory timing. Similar results to what Burger was seeing.\n\nEverything is pure speculation being 3000 miles away and only details being a couple photos but my guess is high intake air temps resulting from lack of cooling is causing the dip and timing pull.OP is welcome to contact technical support and give more information so that they can formulate a more accurate assessment of what may be going on though.\n\n\n\n\n\nHi again guys, Sorry I have been busy these days and I havent got time to read you all. my bad.!Thank you for your answersSo i contacted Dinan Tech, and explained the whole situation, how the dyno test was done, and pretty much more details.Stock runs where done 1st, we did 2 runs, back to back achieving the same results. After that we did 1 last run with a 10 minutes rest, then we activated stage 1 via dinantronics app. and double checked to be sure it was on.we did 2 runs back to back and both of them gave the same problem (same reading). After that the dino guy told me lets wait around 20 minutes to test again with the dinan because its showing me an issue, and thats what we did, after about 20 minutes we did the last run and the results from that run is posted.So I told the dinan tech guy that on the runs Stability Control was on, and it was on comfort mode, and we runned all test with that setting.He told me \"Well from what you are describing and you are showing me, the dinan Stage 1 is working on your car, and you have the lastest software update, my best guess would be that in order to take full advantage of the test you need to turn off completely Stability Control, or run it in MDM \"m dynamic mode\". You see probably whats going on is the car wants to make more power but the stability control is kicking in and the car is trying to control itself from our settings so it play with the AFR to do that. We had the same problem it our M2, and it was caused by the stability control turned on.At the start is actually making more power and it dissipated in the midrange, which tell me its working.\"Now as an advice he told me it would be best to do a second test run and try this new info he is telling me.\n\n\n\nThe instrumented test is the most difficult thing you will want to do to measure performance delta unless in a perfectly controlled environment. There are many variables to lead you to wrong conclusion.And I honestly do not think comparison test you made to TTRS make much senses even if it's properly performed. Reason is simple: different gear ratio plays too big part in 40-60 short pull. You'd be much better do a 60-120 start from highest gear. And one of my M2 buddy already did just that on JB4 map 1 (+4psi, Dinan Sport Tuner equivalence) and map 2 with his otherwise stock car. The result is 9.5 sec on map 1 and an astonishing 8.8~9.0 on map 2. Ambient temperature being 10 degree Celsius or 50 F. Fortunately, he was early enough to realize map 2 is the suicidal map for stock car.The best thing to measure improvement for OP right now, is simply to re-dyno his car on and off, with everything correctly set.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "I searched through this forum a few times but wasn't really turning anything up.In the VW world that I'm familiar with (Golf R / R32), the DSG is actually far more capable of holding torque past the rated limit than a 6MT is.  6MT you can get there by replacing pressure plate & clutch, big pain in the ass and relatively costly parts, and you're going to build up a giant left thigh working the clutch.The DQ250 (rated for 250 Nm of torque) is capable of holding north of 600 N-m (i originally had the wrong unit here, sorry) of torque with just a software flash.However, in order to actually make any power beyond stock, you generally have to flash the transmission because otherwise it will send messages back to the ECU and cut power.In the BMW world, what happens with the DCT is given more power than stock? Do you need to flash these as well, or do they behave more like a 6MT and just take whatever they're given?  Will the M-DCT hold more torque than the 6MT with a flash?  Or does it make more sense to go 6MT if you have bigger power plans?\n\nThe DCT will need dodson clutches around the low 600whp mark to keep putting the power down. Seen a manual car making making close to 700whp with no issues. I'd imagine an alternative material clutch would be in the mod list if you are looking for that power level. At any rate it seems like both transmissions seem to hold power well and not break. Proper driving is always a key component of that though.\n\nI thinkRobin_NLsaid that MT can handle up to 550-600 Nm and DCT up to 700 Nm - heard on another forum apparently from guys who were modding their cars heavily. I also see all tuners (JP Performance, Hamann, Manhart etc.) take DCT also probably due to this fact.I think it's reasonable to take DCT if you plan to mod it above that 550 Nm. Flash for the trans is not really needed, you can flash it with M4 GTS soft if you want but there are no significant changes from what I've read.One comment about the DQ250 (which I currently use in my GTI) it can hold 400Nm without slipping the clutch not 250. Overall it's the same case for GTI as in M2 - guys upping the HP & TQ on MT cars need to put beefier clutch while DSG can handle it quite ok (although with some recommended software tweak to limit Nm on 1-2 gears to enable smooth start from standstill).Maybe it's due to the fact that there are in fact two clutches inside the DKG in both cases, so they can handle more?\n\nNo need to flash the BMW DCT for mild tuning.\n\n\n\nAny word on how the manual transmission holds up with with minor/intermediate tuning? The GS6-45BZ unit is rated for 470nm which is basically what the car puts out stock. Can the clutch/pressure plate be upgrade to boost that value or is it directly related to the gearbox internals?\n\nSeveral M3/M4 are in the mid 600s with manuals without issue. Go read through their engine/tuning section.",

Nothing is better than oem for intakes.\n\nIts not the intake.  You need a better intercooler.\n\nIts been in development for a while now.I follow a fellow M2 owner on IG that has kept me in the loop and I have been in contact with MSR owner also regarding the development who is very responsive and has answered all the questions I have sent him about the development.Was lucky to get some sneak peak pics also.I understand hey were in final stages not long ago.I am waiting to see whp numbers and IAT temperature readings to decide if I would buy.Piece looks great, but I am more interested in function over form, and as many have said here the IC has been shown to be the limiting factor in our cars hence why I still haven't pulled the trigger on any of the Intakes on the market right now. They all look beautiful but not sure about the real gains of them over the stock design.And I am not talking about a pull or two on a dyno, I mean numbers of IAT during a hot track day would be the perfect info.Run a session on a stock intake and then install the aftermarket intake and run a second session in a 85-95 degree weather.\n\n\n\nA good intercooler will be more important than a cold air intake but the factory airbox is only intended to flow a certain amount. When increasing boost levels and increasing the overall flow, the airbox will be a limitation.\n\nThanks for the suggestions guys. To clarify, I'm already running full bolt-ons, including the Wagner EVO II Competition Intercooler. Also, upgraded intercooler pipes, turbo inlet and stage 2 turbos. Even running methanol injection on the street. Map 3 for daily (up to 18 psi) and Map 6 when running race fuel (up to 23 psi).Thus, looking for ways to get colder air into the intake, even thinking about wrapping all metal intake pipes with thermal reflective wrap.\n\n",

    "content": "Has anyone experienced this? it's only when downshifting and seems to come from behind when you release the clutch in the new gear.It's more apparent when carrying a bit more speed and even more so when block changing from say 5th to 3rd. It's not all the time (and of course I can't replicate it when I try!) it may be that this is quite normal, not sure..Thanks\n\nDoes the speed at which you let the clutch out make a difference?  Ie, if you slowly release the pedal you don't get the noise?A couple other things to try to aid in diagnosis:1) In any gear, accelerate at about 1/2 throttle, then abruptly take your foot off the gas.  wait 1 second then back on the gas for a second, then back off the gas for a second.  Basically you want to set up a bucking/lurching motion in the car.  Pick a nice side road where you wont get reported for drunk driving!  Try in a couple different gears and see if you can isolate to a gear or set of gears.2) Find a nice smooth strip of road where you can just cruise along at like 30 Mph.  Doesn't matter which gear.  Take your foot off the gas, leave the car in whatever gear you are in, and pump the clutch in, clutch out, clutch in, clutch out.I'm thinking you might have something loose in the driveline or rear end.  The above will help confirm.\n\nI notice this only when I am downshifting way too slow. The rev-match seems to like clutch shift release clutch really quick and it works well. If the engine does the rev-match and you let the clutch out after the RPMs drop, you get the clunk.\n\nI get this in my car as well.  I have started releasing the clutch a little faster and at a higher RPM.  I don't get the clunk when I do this but do if I release the clutch slowly.\n\nit likes brutality kind of car !!!!!!\n\nIt all depends on the settings your in. On sport+, it will occur more. You just have to understand the cars behavior and try to be smoother when releasing the clutch at slow speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds fairly normal as the diff hooks up but I could be wrong.\n\nI had the same thing thought my clutch stop was messing me up so I removed it. Still had the issue sometimes. The solution: release the clutch quickly/make sure you know exactly where the catch point is.If I released the clutch \"normal\" like I would in any other car I got the clunk. So I release it much quicker now.Initially I thought the catch point was towards the middle/up top, but for me it's in the beginning, so I just make sure to briefly pause at that point then release and my downshifts no longer have the clunk. As before I was just releasing past the catch point I suppose which shocks something.Just wondering, what exactly is making that sound though? The diff?\n\nI think it might be the dual mass flywheel at it's limit, making the clunk feeling. It helps with springs to absorb the shock, but at max, it would make sense to me it would feel like a clunk as the clutch wont really slip after it is engaged enough to load the flywheel. I could be talking out my ass though, but I don't know what else in the drive line would have slack to clunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI experienced this only in the break-in period but haven't since.",

Whenever the factory charge pipe break at the plastic seam, the engine immediately senses a huge vacuum leak where the engine ECU counters by sending the engine into a LIMP MODE condition.Usually, the car's performance will feel dimished and lack luster as if running without a proper firing cylinder.The Active Autowerke N55 Charge Pipe is a designated product designed from inception to cure and eliminate this problem on your BMW.Constructed from all aluminum makes this charge pipe almost indestructible.The connection to the throttle body is a CNC machined part to duplicate the factory fit as well making a tight, reliable seal.Owners of BMW with the N55 engine understands that additional power can be reliably maintained with the use of Water/Methanol injection as an added feature. However, the N55 current does not have a reliable source to accommodate the application of a Water/Methanol nozzles.The Active Autowerke N55 Charge Pipe has a proper proviison for this specific application. A boss with two separate ports are provided upstream where the injected mix of water/methanol can properly atomize before entering the engine. The thread depths for the water/metahnol nozzles are also checked to allow for a proper spray pattern without hitting the inside walls of the threaded holes.The BMW N55 engine does not utilize external diverter valves like it's N54 predecessor. Rather, the BMW N55 has diverter valves that are built inside the engine turbo compressor housings and no in the charge pipe. As such, there are no provisions to add larger BOVs.KEY FEATURES:Specific design to correct a problemConsistent diameter tubing for increased performanceIncreased throttle response and decrease throttle lagCNC machined throttle housing for a poper sealRetains factory BMW O-Ring sealProvision of raised boss for 2 Water/Methanol nozzlesBLACK powder coated for that OEM lookHigh quality silicone couplers and stainless clamps are includedNOTE:The factory throttle clip and O-ring are not included with the N55 Charge Pipe****NOT COMPATIBLE WITH XI MODELS",

Cleared the CEL with an app. It's a very sensitive system, but it happens so infrequently it's not an issue for me.\n\n\n\nMake sure the MAF is fully seated, no leaks, and placed in the correct orientation.\n\n\n\nI'm sure you have but check the vacuum hose connection also. Just trying to help!\n\n\n\nSo theoretically, whatever oil was on there could have screwed it up.. I guess the only way to find out would be to switch back to stock and see what happens.\n\nIt isn't the MAF or the oiled filter. It's the fact that it has different flow characteristics than the stock intake. You have one of two choices when it comes to an aftermarket intake.  Either it stays near stock flow and doesn't do anything, other than sound better, or it flows significantly differently (maybe good, maybe bad) and will trigger an alert.It's pretty much pointless unless you unlock the DME and code for the intake on your own car. Besides, all the Eventuri videos I've seen have what appears to be a compressor surge sound. Can't say it is directly caused by the intake, but take a closer listen for it. Maybe I'm wrong about the sound.\n\nI have KN filter on mine and never had any issues.\n\nCar is currently throwing a pending code after MAF clean so I'm absolutely going to throw the stock intake on in the next couple of weeks. I'll report back if it goes away for good (expected).\n\n\n\n\n\nMy buddy has been running CTS Intake for 6k miles and 0 issues.I'm definitely not trying to spend Eventuri money and still causing CEL.\n\n\n\nOP can you emailinfo@eventuri.netwith a picture of your carbon tune around the MAF boss area?There hasn't been any issues reported back regarding a CEL on this intake. Its one of the most popular kits.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Guys, I just have had my 2017 MPE (unfortunately with the red button) together with akrapovic 300 cpsi dp installed. And yesterday I had an opportunity to see an M2 with full akra exhaust set dp and muffler.And at this point things started to get interesting because the owner mentioned that he had is engine remapped because after installing it they made measurements which showed that that AFR goes almost lean.First of all Akra says that dp does work fine with it's stock engine map, the other thing is that I don't believe that computer changed air to fuel ratio after switching cats without showing any CEL information.Some say you don't need to tune the car after changing dp some say you have to. Right now I'm a bit worriedif Im going to have any problems. I don't want to tune my M2 as long as I am perfectly fine with its stock power, the only reason why i changed dp is the sound which is better compared to the mpe with stock dp.\n\nSo far I'm guessing there are at least 10+ active forum members that are running a catted downpipe with no tune and no problemsIf I recall correctly akra downpipe is not made by akra and is the generic HJS dp most bmw tuners in Germany offerA DP makes much more sense with a tune but is not exactly a requirementYou should be fine\n\nYes it is HJS 300 cpsi, I believe the difference is aprox. 400 cells less. First what i thought is that he should be checking his intake system if the afr went higher.And as you said I also remember that dp gives the possibility for the bigger power gains with new map, but no one ever said I have to do it.But to be honest with the whole system installed, car seems to be a little bit more nervous in the lower range or maybe its just my mind lol.\n\nA lean condition would be absolutely normal in closed loop operation, nothing to worry about. Under full loaf most of these sensors are ignored and the car is using target data to account for air fuel mix.The cars boost is also lower with a DP, so this would change the AFR.I think a tune would be a benefit after DP install but not necessary. I ran my 1m with no tune and no cats for 2 years and had no issue, AFRs on the Dyno were spot on.\n\n",

    "content": "Sup everybody!  So I'm back to update everybody on my build.So since I last posted, I've made quite a few changes to my car.  I actually changed intercoolers to Evolution Racewerk's (Their FMIC is GREAT during my 5th gear pulls only 4 degree delta!), got most of the car clear bra'd (Nanofusion) and of course got Pure's stage 2 turbo!  I had a LOT of stupid issues with the turbo initially (horrible quality control from Pure) and it actually caused a huge delay in my car and it was down for quite a while.  I don't even want to begin to get into everything but I'm sorted out now (thx SSR Performance).So for those who didn't read my last post, I basically dyno'd my car at European Auto Source a while back when I basically was FBO minus exhaust, bootmod3 and stock turbo.  On a conservative tune we were able to put down about 420 whp and 455 wtq.  At those power levels, the car was fun!  I was happy with where the car was... for a while.So fast forward to today, after a bunch of headaches and stress from the turbo, here we are.Now that everything is up and running I hit up Dzenan at ProTuningFreaks to work on tuning the car.  Dzenan's been awesome to work with and has done WONDERS for my car.  Dialed in (on my stock turbo map) my car made a LOT more power and the power delivery was very smooth, felt very close to OEM except with added power.So when I got into European Auto Source, we initially got some power readings and at about 17 psi the car made about 450 whp and I forget exactly but it made a really low torque reading of about 420 or so (I made 458 on stock turbo on the same dyno).View post on imgur.comcar getting ready for dynoI hit up PTF and the wizard himself Dzenan was able to get me some revisions.  He waves his magic wand and next thing you know, BOOM you got more boost!  He got me quite a few revisions and we got up to 18-18.5 psi I believe and we ended there.  Car is still in the process of getting tuned, so definitely more room to grow and the tune could still be cleaned up in some places for sure.  I'll keep everyone updated when I got stuff to report, but be on the lookout, me and ProTuningFreaks about to go big!  Depending on what PTF says, I may try going into full e85 if my fueling can handle it.View post on imgur.comStill in tuning process.  I'll post again when I have a more finalized tune and numbers.I still have a lot planned for my car as far as mods, still unsure of where to go next with it.  Looking to either do wheels, big brake kit or I may do bucket seats and rear seat delete.  Possibly even some meth for cooling, cuz who doesn't need meth in their life?  Where do you guys think I should go from here?I'm really more into track stuff but I do intend on doing some drag strip stuff soon and will probably post my times when I get 'em, so be on the lookout!Before I sign off I just wanted to give a big thanks to SSR Performance getting my build together, Christine at Evolution Racewerks for the intercooler (which is AWESOME, 4 degree delta!), Steve at Fuel-it!, Harold at HP autosports, Steve and European Auto Source for use of their dyno and in general just being great guys and car enthusiasts, and last but not least Dzenan and ProTuningFreaks! Bootmod3!!!  My car's awesome and I give all credit to you guys getting my build together so thx everybody!!!\n\nI'd just run e85 and call it a day\n\nLooks stout! How's your fueling so far?  I want to pickup an M2 here in the near future and do some similar mods targetting about 600whp on 80+% ethanol so I'm watching things like this pretty closely.  Might have to meet up one of these days...take you for a ride in a 1000whp E46 M3 in exchange for you taking me in a ride in this maybe.\n\nOP really amazing numbers! Is this a new M2 record?\n\nAll for meth. E85 is good but not always easily accessible.\n\ngreat numbers! what are you doing for fueling now?\n\nCongrats, full mod list please?\n\nOops, looks like I forgot to mention in my post fueling.First time at EAS I was on e47 (50/50 blend) using Fuel it!'s Platinum port injection kit.  I was on their stage 2 LPFP first time around, this time I'm actually on their stage 3 LPFP.  I wasn't seeing issues with fueling as far as volume goes but I wanted the stage 3 ready if and when I do go with full e85.  Still working out the tune for e47 right now, so that's not for a while.CommanderwigginYeah, PM me we can meet at one of the local shops around here.  Not so sure about your car though.  Only 1000 horsepower?  Pshh if you said 2000 you mighta impressed me, but ONLY double the horsepower of my car? pshhh :PMTWONo.  I haven't seen too many dyno numbers with an m2 and PS2 but I know Pure dyno'd a car last year at 550ish whp and around 500 wtq.  Hard to say what my car can push when I'm done with the tune but I think I'll be able to pass those numbers.  I saw some numbers of another n55 PS2 and they were actually only able to make slightly less power than my car but running 24 PSI compared to my 18.5.I'm already running e85 and may run full e85 so I'm not sure how meth would work out.   I'm not sure but I would assume the meth and the e85 wouldn't play well together as far as fueling goes since e85 doesn't really work well with low temperatures.  I may look into it for just cooling though but not sure if it's worth it.slowbrickagreed.  Where I am (SoCal) it's pretty plentiful.  I mean you can get stuck without e85 stations around here more towards the less populated areas but for the most part around LA and Orange County you can find it no problem.Norcalmav23Sup man?  How's your car doing?  Just enjoying the m2?  What happened with your fueling?  Weren't you about to go PI or meth or something? I'd love to know what's going on with your ride! Mod list is as follows, hopefully I don't forget anything:Evolution Racewerks 4\" catless DP, ER's charge pipes (both sides), ER Intercooler, Fuel it!'s stage 3 LPFP with their lines, ethanol analyzer, their platinum PI kit with AICS controller (for BEF), Pagid rs29 brake pads, Stoptech stainless steel brake lines using castrol SRF, Vorshlag camber plates, Ohlins Road and Track coilovers and full front Nanofusion clear bra (covers the whole front, rocker panels and I had some small trouble areas covered) and of course the Pure stage 2 and bootmod3.  Feels like I forgot something.  :P\n\ngreat work, man!since you're in SoCal, i'm trying to put together a meet/greet/drive. still planning it out and gathering interest. hope you can join us! check out the regional forum for details\n\nVery nice!\n\nAwesome numbers and that dyno curve looks great.

    "content": "I remember there was a previous post on this but I haven't heard much else. I finally pulled the trigger and picked one up.I picked it up from UROTuning for $300 incl. S/H, but as of this writing I believe it is on sale nowThe goodsThe instructions linkedhere.I'm a fan of DIY because you won't get to know your car unless you personally work on it yourself. Level of difficulty is low.The instructions were written for the 335i but it can be applied to our cars. The only difference I came across that wasn't in the instructions was you will need to remove the right brace to remove the OEM intake. It will make your life easier as you will need to pull the entire stock intake box out.There were a few other hiccups along the way. For starters you will need to remove a plastic heat shield that is covering some electrical wiring.The instructions didn't say much about this but the one caveat is that once you install the heat shield, this plastic cover won't fit anymore so it will be left off. Not a big deal as most of these wires are heat wrapped but still, the cover is there for a reason.Another hiccup is in Step 6. It calls for you to secure the heat shield to one of the openings on the frame. Take your time on this as the supplied kit only comes with 2 screws/bolts. One is used to secure the Y-support of the filter/MAF piece and the other is the secure the heat shield to the frame.I have fat fingers so I dropped one trying to hold it in place while I was guiding the screw through the heat shield....and it dropped to the bottom plastic skid protector which required me to jack the car, unscrew one of the plastic torx screws, and crab claw it out FMLOtherwise, it's straight forward. Definitely take your time to make sure fitment works and everything is aligned. What people say is a 1 hour task really took me 2-2.5 hours (closer to 2 if you don't drop the stupid nut) because you want to make sure everything fits.The million dollar question that everyone has is whether or not this intake will throw codes. So far I haven't gotten any after driving 100 or so miles these past few days. For sure carefully follow the instructions and take your time moving the MAF sensor. I used a torx screw driver and gently hand tightened it. I wouldn't over do it as you definitely don't want to strip the screw.Overall, CTS is a quality product. The piping is well made, fitment was spot on (with the exception of the heat shield) and I enjoyed it on my MK7 Golf R so I knew what I was getting into. As for driving, definitely audible. It makes all the right noises being a open intake and it is pretty loud in the cabin.A video wouldn't do any justice and I doubt my iPhone would pick anything up.Enough babbling, here are some pics of the finished product.BeforeAfterGot some other goodies sitting in the garage that I'll post my install/review in the coming weeks.\n\nGot a video clip ?Haven't installed mine (been away for the past month)\n\n\n\nAny performance gains, or is this a purely cosmetic mod? (And sound I suppose)\n\nOP,Early F2x came wo the plastic cover on but like you say its fitted for a reason.I'd not be happy about fitting aftermarket parts that mean you have to remove permenantly an adjacent oem cover to make it fit. Smacks of insufficient R&D/prototyping TBH.just my 2 cents.BP\n\n\n\n",

Is this just poor sealant on the pump?\n\nI'd clean it up, and keep an eye on it to see if it continues.\n\nAlmost skipped out on the whole install tonight but went through with it. Only have 609miles so getting close the break in period\n\nNice!Pictures?I might have to until I knew if it was really leaking or not.\n\nThese cars have electric power steering, so this shouldn't be a hydraulic leak from it. Maybe a kind of grease possible from the mechanic part?\n\nWell he noticed it on the lift before he started to work on it so it wasn't anything he did. Again it was just the exhaust and DP install\n\nIs it a liquid? or is it like a dried sealant?If liquid, take it to the dealership for inspection.\n\n\n\nIt's cosmoline. The dealers remove most of it in prep.Cosmoline is a yellowish, light-amber, or greenish colored ointment-like mass, having a slight fluorescence, petroleum-like odor and taste. It is similar to petroleum jelly in properties, appearance, and thickness. It is the purified residue obtained from the distillation of petroleum oils.Chemically, cosmoline is a homogeneous mixture of oily and waxy long-chain, non-polar hydrocarbons. It can range in color from white to yellow, and can differ in viscosity and shear strength. Cosmoline melts at 113–125 °F (45–52 °C) and has a flashpoint of 365 °F (185 °C).Its most common use is in the storage and preservation of firearms. Previously, cosmoline was used to preserve other things. Objects the size of entire vehicles could be preserved for future use with cosmoline.\n\n\n\nI have it too.  Gonna mention it to the dealer when I go in for service.I also have some oil leaking from the sensor in the bottom of the oil pan\n\nThis is not a leak.  It is just cosmoline that has settled there from when that stuff gets removed at the port.  There is no way for them to get it out of everywhere.  It is just a glorified waxy product.\n\n+1. Looks like cosmoline to me. Go to the track and burn it off. German cars stink of it their first time out. When it stops smelling like cosmoline, it's properly broken in.",

I took breaks for lunch, dinner, made 2 trips to home depot for extra tools.I found this thread, which helped alot...http://www.2addicts.com/forums/showthread.php?t=970868I guess he knew what he was doing because it only took him about an hour.The only difference is that we need a 5/16ths TORX bit on the M2 to help loosen up the exhaust hanger.I initially put her on ramps but i needed more ground clearance so I put her on jack stands.Next I removed the O2 sensors from the engine bay.  This part was not straight forward as there is a little gray clip that you need to click up and then use a flathead to unlatch them.  There are also some small metal clips between the wire connectors and that cat that slide off with minimal effort.I was finally able to pull out the cat with the O2 sensors attached and from there it was pretty straightforward.I took it her out for a brief run after putting everything back together and I am shocked how much louder she is.  Warm up is extremely loud even with the valves closed (I have the MPE) and is insane when you open up the throttle.Hope this helps anyone that is about to DIY the Fabspeed sport cat.\n\nI have the same Fabspeed cat but with the GTHAUS exhaust and it did make the car a great deal louder and deeper. I debated doing it myself, but was worried I'd end up like you. Glad you got it in there.\n\n\n\nI also did the downpipe install myself and really its not bad at all. Honestly the thing that hinders you the most is the ground clearance. It just makes it more difficult but with a lift it should be doable in 2-3 hrs taking your time to do it right.\n\n\n\nGetting the clamps back on - especially the front one - was the hardest part for me.\n\nI fired her up again this morning omg it booms!  I noticed a smell like unburnt fuel I hope that this is not going to last.\n\nMine is catless so the smell is always there but it doesn't bother me. With yours I don't know if it will persist but if it does it should be minimal.\n\nNice work but a 5/16 (inch) TORX on a European car...I'd be very surprised.  More likely 8mm\n\n\n\n\n\nTakes a little longer when you transfer the brass gasket on the old downpipe to the new one.  That thing is a bitch and draws blood from you.\n\n\n\n\n\nI left that jagged thing where it was, on the stock DP.  I hope that doesn't make me a bad person.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Cars can/have issues and when they do, bootmod3's there to provide immense insight and help in resolving them.PS... I' ran jb4 for 7 months with more inconsistency than consistent days; spent plenty of dyno time & drag-strip testing; logs after logs after logs; went thru 4 different firmwares and still car was not happy. Long story short, running Bootmod3 OTS Beta since Black Friday and my current OTS revision since Christmas & 3500 miles later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime to install the JB and remove the DME are maybe 10mins apart on these cars. If you ship it to them or a dealer they do it next day. Can't compare apples and oranges really. One is a flash, a true tune that controls everything while the other is a piggyback and sits extrrnally and tries its best to get the show going. My friends have all sorts of sporadic issues on the JB drivertrain malfunctions, boost always up or down and wavy and we just noticed comparing to bm3 logs its so slow to log in comparison to bm3 to the point its just lacking so much data. Car just drives so much better with a flash and makes more power everywhere especially on pump gas.\n\n\n\nBootmod3 has turn key maps. They call them OTS. They have set records already with custom tuning too on N55s.\n\nI would have to Agree with VF on this one, Generalizing all other tunes to BM3 sounds a little biased without having experience with other tune's out there. Sure BM3's customizing and logging aspects are great, much along the lines of the old cobb acessport. The customers we have done BM3 to are very happy and i have no ill will about it.BUT....  There are also people out there that have zero desire to log, switch maps, or incorporate their phone/handheld into their tune. Some people simply want a flash tune/jb4 etc, and turn their car on and go without worrying.\n\nThat's basically all I want haah I don't want to unlock dme right now while still under warranty I just want the cel gone and a decent horsepower jump to utilize my bolt ons\n\n",

    "content": "I am looking to fit a catted downpipe to my m2 and stay with stock tune. At least that's what I figure works best for me.I take it many recommend against that approach, the primary 3 reasons being:1) DME will adjust to the freer flow so the power gain is minimized.2) Stock tune won't take full advantage of it.3) CEL will be thrown eventually.On #1, I also heard that BMW turbo engine DME is load based and will not discount the power gain out of a freer flow exhaust. Not sure.On #2, what does that mean exactly? More specific on the untaken advantages?I am not pursuing a new high at down low or something, but instead wanting to address the significant TQ tapering down all the way to fuel cutoff, which is seen on many m2 dyno charts due to stock turbo flow limitation.Specifically, is catted DP's PRESSURE HOLDING capability at upper range compromised with stock tune? To make no mistake, to hold the pressure, I am not asking turbo to work harder.On #3, to be reasonable, I will accept the cat failure if it's endured heavy usage for years - stock cat can fail under excessive usage too. I'll just buy a new one.Appreciate someone in the know shed some lights, especially on #1 and #2.\n\n1. DME probably does adjust for it a little at max load. I ran the Fabspeed catted pipe for a month with no other mods. The midrange increase is more noticeable than the top end.2. The stock boost taper is to protect the turbo for longevity and to avoid warranty claims. The freer flowing downpipe will allow the turbo to work less hard throughout the rev range. An untuned car misses the benefits of the the more efficient turbo.3. I've never seen a CEL on mine after several thousand miles. I can't recall anyone else with a quality 200 cell or greater catted pipe getting one either.Bonus #4. After a very mild tune in conjunction w catted pipe, the car is alive and a rabid beast on the street. The sound improvement alone with the pipe is worth every penny. Please just get a nice catted pipe and never look back. I'll PayPal you 10$ if you're not thrilled after driving!\n\n\n\n2/boost will not change without a tune, you will get more power because of high flow cats but it when you tune your car boost will be raised to make even more power3/ We offer the VRSF CEL delete, it will hide the code without the need of a tune\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Here's a slightly different review of the JB+. I do not plan on doing any significant mods (Maybe a DP down the road).  I actually felt the stock power on the M2 to be enough, but like many of you, wanted more, just a little more.  Ordered the JB+ last week (Thanks for the help Mike) and arrived a few days later.  Installation was simple as many have stated, the toughest part was probably figuring out the clip to the connector.  After that, it was easy.Before I installed the unit, I opened it up to check the setting, to my surprise, it was set to max.  So I adjust it back to 12 o'clock (around 3 psi) as I do not want an aggressive tune.  Took it out for a drive, very noticeable power and torque gain.  Lots of wheel spin everywhere, like many have said, first 3 gears, spin spin spin. And I wasn't even going WOT.  There were some jerks here and there, and the transmission was doing some shifts on it's own.  I figured it was the ECU trying to learn, so I just left it at that.  Next few days the shifts were a lot smoother but the power was still there.  And that dip in the 5k rpm range shown in the dyno graphs from other reviewers is true.  There's also a little bit more turbo lag, not a lot, but it's there.Maybe I'm getting old, but I do not enjoy wheel spin, especially when it's in the mid rpm range.  I don't want to modulate the throttle when I'm going straight.  And I definitely don't want that to happen when I'm on the track.  Also want a smoother delivery. So I did the unthinkable... I dialed it down to 11 o'clock.I'm liking it a lot more. Power is smoother, no more unwanted wheel spins.  The car felt more balanced.  I would not be surprised if I go back to stock one day, as I feel the stock tune to be very well balanced and \"safe\" on the track.Overall, I'm satisfied with the product, considering the price/hp it's the bargain of the century.  Will be heading to the track in a few weeks, will give some more feedback after.  Heat soak would be my concern without upgrading the intercooler, but it's still relative cold up here, so it should be fine with the current setting.P.S. For you Canadians, shipping/tax/custom was painless as they ship from Mississauga. Wish more US companies would do that.\n\nThanks for the writeup. I'm definitely interested in any potential heat soak @ the track. Keep us posted. 93 octane?\n\nFWIW, MAF signal, which this device modifies, is only indirectly influencing boost. So max or 3 psi on the M2 by no means is the equivalent of max or 3 psi on an M235i for example. Load is going to be calculated differently due to the differences in stock tune.What we do know for sure is that at peak RPM the M2 has about 1-1.5psi available margin on 93 octane and no margin at all on 91.AFAIK no one running an otherwise stock M2 with JB+ on max is having any problems.\n\nThanks for the clarification. I'm running 94 octane at the moment and 100 at the track.  So as long as I'm not getting negative boost, I'm happy with what the end result is right now.\n\nBest Review for boost-only type piggyback to date.\n\nDon't blame you, I would run stock boost for the track but for the street extra power if fun.  Thanks for the review.\n\n3Siif i lived in Toronto my car would be withproTUNING Freaks\n\n\n\nGood write up\n\nThanks for the write up.I have a couple questions...You say that it shifted on it's own a few times - so I assume you have DCT... why not shift yourself so you can hold the gear to really feel the power?(or lack of it)Also, you post this in April, in Toronto. What is the temperature average on these days you test it? I ask because not only will the car make more power with the cold air, but the tires would not perform anywhere near their peak if cold - which may have both led to the wheel spin issue.\n\n\n\nAre you telling stock IC is good enough to handle piggyback boost on track?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all,It might seem odd but, I want to know if there is a way to make the vehicle not as loud during a cold start. Either through coding or tuning? I assume the exhaust valve opens, thus could there be a way to disable that function? Any thoughts on the topic are appreciated.\n\nYou could ask the bootmod3 developers for a feature request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a resonator delete and sport cat DP. Cold start is downright brutal. I hit the ignition and immediately drive off in the hopes of staying in the good graces of my neighbors at 5:30 am.\n\nUnfortunately it does make a huge real world difference. Cats don't work until it's warm. That being said, yes it's leagues better than people running catless pursuing 20ish whp and noise.BTW engine and lubricants also need those precious 20 secs to warm up. Oil viscosity can go much thinner in that time to be protective enough for you to start driving.\n\n\n\nOn a Porsche, I defeated the cold start by starting the car, quickly turning it off and then restarting the car. Haven't tried it on the m2. The computer must be tricked into thinking the car is warm.All of the things stated above have limited value. The cold start warms the cats to reduce emissions. No engine benefits.\n\nDoes the cold start process reduce back pressure? My understanding is that it opens the flaps in the exhaust during it.... so would reducing back pressure be easier on the engine while it is cold? I doubt it is exhaust emissions related\n\n\n\nThere is another, easier, solution. Make an audio recording of your cold start, then play it back in a loop in front of your dogs all day long while you're out at the office. After a few hours, or, depending how intelligent they are, a few days or weeks, they'll most probably give up going apeshit ! Of course, if they're slow learners it might take a few months...\n\n\n\nOn my 135, when I had the catless DP installed it was brutal on the cold start. I would bring the RPMs up to 12-1400 or so and just hold it there until the cold start process was done. Like 10 seconds. I dont know if that works on my M2...

    "content": "Finally after months of finding some time I went to a local dealer here in Prague - BMW Stratos Prosek - to drive a LBB BMW M2 Coupe with a manual gearbox and a MPE exhaust. Since I personally have a M-DCT and a stock exhaust soon to be replaced by an Akrapovic exhaust I wanted to hear the exhaust and find out how the manual drives.First of all the exhaust, since we are in the exhaust section of the forum. The standard sound track is louder than stock (of course), more pronounced inside the cabin and definitely more sporty. The sound also fits to the ASD where another aftermarket kit would have difficulties with that. Simply because it is louder and the sound is coming from the outside it would not fit with the sound produced by the ASD. One of the reasons why I deleted the ASD on my car.There is a lovely nice rumble in the MPE which gives it a lot nicer audio-able feedback than stock also while driving. While running through the different modes (including the hidden exhaust mode) it sounds a lot better than stock and pops and brubbles a lot more on throttle release.I showed the sales person the hidden feature and initially he was not aware of it. He loved it and while driving through the city with the windows open it was a feast for the ears while listening to what came from the back. I also tried the remote control for the MPE which is stored in the cup holder, and I absolutely hated it. The set up of that remote is annoying. The light is hard to see, you never know if the exhaust is open or close, or least often you are guessing if it is open or close. Not a clear system at all IMO, but I only used for 30 minutes. Let's call it not intuitive.Amazingly while driving and when the hidden exhaust mode was engaged (traction off), the soundtrack from the exhaust was less pronounced with the valve open than with the value closed. It was a noticeable difference. Not sure why that was, but it was different. In Sport mode it was the other way around.Overall in my opinion the MPE is a great set up for those people that want more noise from the car since it fits to the internal sound design! It definitely gives you a better exhaust noise and it is a lot louder inside the cabin. The sound overall is louder and darker, but not annoyingly. It felt quite natural although it sometimes drones a slight bit (This can also be the ASD I am not used to anymore). Only thing I missed was a higher pitched soundtrack at higher revs, but that is something you can create with a downpipe.From a nice exhaust to the manual, but first of all the seats! I had automatic seats in this M2, and you sit higher. I felt like sitting on top of a mountain in that thing, even though I moved the seats to the lowest position. The manual seats are lower, especially because I ride on the lowest setting in my car.Then to the manual, what a wonderful box it is. The manual shifts brilliantly. I love how it changes gear and it involves the driver. The auto-blipping is something I absolutely hate. That is beyond annoying, especially because you cannot disengage it without going completely off on all safety systems. Not overly happy with that feature at all. Coding it out is the answer here. Other than that what a nice box, but I am really happy I choose a M-DCT.The main surprise for me was the difference in character between the two cars. It is bigger than you think, especially if you own one. I never expected it but both feel so different to each other when you drive them back to back. The quicker responses you have with the DCT box versus the involvement of the shifter. I drove either car totally different, and that is remarkable while also great to see that the same car can have two different faces simply because it has a different box.All in all a wonderful experience today, which allowed me to experience a manual M2 and one fitted with a MPE after driven three other cars before, all LBB and M-DCT by the way. Special thanks to BMW Stratos Prosek in Prague.MR\n\nGreat review! Indeed the MPE is a great addition to the M2!\n\nThanks for the info....\n\nGood to hear that you enjoyed the manual version.  I've  only driven  the DCT version as the manual is not available for test drive.  I've ordered the manual version as I've mainly owned manuals and the DCT was not engaging enough for me.It's good to see that BMW still make drivers cars unlike Audi and Merc that only offer auto Dual clutch transmissions.\n\n\n\nLove the sound...6MT with MPE(Ti tips, no CF diffuser)CheersRobin\n\n\n\nI think, that it is very hard - the question between a manual and the DCT.I drove the DCT for about one week und the Manual only for a short trip.And what should I say... The DCT is just perfect.But do you really want such a perfect gearbox in a fun car - I think, that this is the main question.For me the answer was clear. I ordered the Manual and I personally love the Rev Matching. It is those connection between the classic and the modern shifting world...But I can understand everyone who is going for the DCT.Especially in ordinary daily situations it is the gearbox, which gives the M2 a more wider spectrum.\n\n",

Don't remember the price but would order it again in a heartbeat.Yeah, I know it doesn't give any HP gain...it's just about sound.  But hey, sound is importantSo the big question is should I get it for the M2?My 2 concerns are:- It's $2,500, woaa.  That's pretty steep.- Is it too loud?  Will my neighbors kick me out of my neighborhood?Anyway, what do you guys think?  Anyone that got it that regrets it?  Anyone that didn't regret it?Here's a reminder of how it sounds!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not much for \"bling\", definitely more performance oriented. Although, when I first heard the MPE at VIR last year that was pretty much it. Was slightly disappointed when finding out there wasn't a touch of performance gain. It pretty much came down to sound, looks, and it is a factory BMW part - warranty and value.I love the MPE! It sounds outstanding! I do have the \"start-up vibration\" issue although not a big deal, for me, really.Also, this past weekend I opened the flaps in Comfort mode, to see if it they would open - yes! You do not need to be in Sports+ to open the flaps. They never once closed on their own as a few others have mentioned.\n\nSave your money and buy a catless downpipe. You'll get the same level of sound/noise and a performance gain. If you're worried about the look then you can always buy aftermarket tips. MPE just isn't worth the price point imo\n\nI drive mine with the flaps open all of the time.  It sounds awesome.....no regrets!\n\nNot a single regret at all.  With the flaps open, the car sounds unreal.  You don't even need a stereo at that point.\n\nI'd like to hear some more opinions on the catless downpipe vs MPE.  OP, would you consider getting a catless downpipe to save $3,500+?\n\nI wanted the exhaust, but decided it's not worth it and the stock exhaust actually sounds very good for stock.\n\nno regrets, drive in track mode 50% of the time and haven't had any neighbors complain.  glad i got the original version (install at port last week of jan '17) before the new version with the additional red button in the trunk came out.\n\nI had the revised MPE fitted a few days ago, I'm also running a Fabspeed sport cat DP. I honestly cant believe how these two mods; combined with a tunnel, can make a six cylinder engine sound like a V10 Huracan.It sounds unbelievable.And the cold start is beyond brutal!!I got the new one with the \"red button\" in the boot but I'm sure there'll be a work around for that soon enough.\n\nI ordered my M2 with the M performance package which included the MPE, if you're already going to add the other bits (black grills, CF rear spoiler, MPE w/CF tips & decal, which I removed) that's included with it, there is a cost savings besides being port installed.  So it's basically done by the time you pick it up with a warranty.As for any regrets, NO!  I'd probably do it again but I'm also going to add a Fabspeed Sport Cat Downpipe to actually see some performance gains like many other have done.  I'm also not the type of person who likes to draw attention to myself but the noise doesn't bother me.  After showing my buddy the car he txt me afterwards and said, \"Whatever that exhaust cost it was worth it\"!  I agree!Also be ready to code out the ASD, I wasn't a fan of the MPE with it on at all.\n\nThose who can regret wouldn't buy in the first place.\n\nPerformance exhaust sounds good but i dont think it is worth that price tag\n\nI'm a little concerned about the vibration at cold start\n\ndrove mine today in track mode. unreal sound and tone. I don't have a trunk button, just a double click on the remote. it's expensive but it's under warranty and looks super good. plus maybe you shave a few pounds of unsprung weight.. get that better handling\n\n\n\nIt made the character of the car for me.  I drive probably 95% in sport+ and in track mode.  In the mornings, I actually hope for stop and go traffic on the highway.  It just brings a smile to my face.  Definitely worth it to me, and so far every other M2 member I've met loved it.  Absolutely ZERO regrets.  I may be a different case since I paid an unrealistically low price for the exhaust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the chance to hear my car in traction mode + track mode from outside the cabin for the first time the other day. When standing next to the car it's very deep and sounds amazing. As the car gets some distance the howl of the motor dies down quickly but the overrun echoes from everywhere. I think the m2's MPE is very well made. I now feel less guilty for always using track mode, as I know it's not as crass as all these muscle cars that floor it around town. 10/10, would get again.My 2 cents, the tips look great, save some money and forgo the carbon covers.At least for now..",

    "content": "Hi guys is it possible to have a dump valve for the M2 with the sneeze noise each time you change gear or let off the throttle after spooling  the turbo ?\n\nWhy?\n\nA lot of modern turbo cars don't run well with those.\n\nGo get a Subaru!LOL, JK.Some turbo cars have pop off valves in their design and thus vent extra pressure off into the atmosphere, while others have diverter valves which do not vent the pressurize gas to the atmosphere but recirculated it.  When you let up on the gas that spooled pressure has to go somewhere.The Benz CLA (and it's lesser cohorts) uses a pop off design and when my friend's car vents the extra gas it's a very loud and frankly unsettling noise. Same with his WRX STI. Both of those cars are heavily modified.I don't think the M2 does that.Mike\n\nThis brings back memories of my Honda days when kids wanted to add a turbo kit just to hear a blow off value go off LOL.I swear every time a Subaru drives by me on the road, they have to shift right next to me so i hear the blow off value\n\nThe M2 has a recirc dump. You can hear it, especially if you have changed filters.I used to have a Subaru with a Forge VTA Dump. I wouldn't want it on my M2.\n\nThere is a lot of money to be made selling aftermarket diverter valves and what not, which add no measurable performance but 'look nice' in the car.  They are not very expensive as parts go and very easy to swap out.  So it's more value as a \"hobby\" item than as a real performance part.  If I need new diverter valves because my 14 year old originals failed, I guess I get some from ECS for the bling then! The originals are about $65 and the bling ones are about $85 each.I must say the sound that is made by the maxed out CLA45 when it vents boost is insane.  Not my kind of ride.Mike\n\nget a turtle instead\n\nPlease don't add a blow off valve.  ...Even if you could\n\nI didn't ask if you guys approved or not just if anyone knew of a valve that is fitted to an M2No worries\n\nLook at synapse, they make one. Or just run a spacer for like 100 bucks.\n\nmy knowledge here is sort of dated, so some things may have changed, but I think it's called a waste gate, my understanding is that they need them to cut off boost at a certain PSI or bad things can happen like engine knock, and blown head gaskets.  In aviation they monitored Manifold boost pressure so in an emergency situation they could over boost the engine those engines might not have had these gates.  Cars not so much at leastI thinkall turbo superchargers and belt driven supercharged cars have them.So you don't need to add one, they must manage any overpressure already.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting thread. On my way to PetCo now to look at some turtles.\n\n\n\n^^I can't even...it sounds like it's being raped... oh man!\n\nTo help the OP out FORGE Motorsports makes one. Contact them. Install is a bit more involved but achievable yourself at home.\n\nIf you get an aggressive open element Intake you will get 50-100 percent what your after. Small flutter too\n\n",

What are you guys experience with different modes with warming up?\n\n\n\nI wouldn't say irrelevant...If you drive the same in all 3 modes, under the same weather conditions, I'd say S+ would warm up the fastest because it holds a lower gear with the DCT.  6mt, I don't think it would make a difference with MDM.my .02\n\nI have an M235, but I wouldn't think warming up the M2 would be any different.  Engine oil temp is the most important fluid to get up to temp prior to using moderate to full throttle because oil tends to take the longest to warm up fully.  Per my Torque App, on a stone cold motor and in 40 degree weather, it takes about 10 minutes of driving to get the oil up to 190-200 degrees which is the low end of optimal operating oil temp.  In 70 degree weather, cold motor, it takes about 8 minutes.  In 90 degree weather, about 6 minutes.  If the motor is somewhat warm, you can cut those times in about half.  In 20 degree weather and cold motor?  It's over 15 minutes.Fully warmed up, the oil temp will stay in the 225-245 degree range.From what I've seen, driving mode has no effect on warm up or managing temps once the oil/coolant are up to temp.Fastest way to warm up a car.

Otherwise you can usually start driving right away however I still naturally sit briefly before I get going.\n\nI just leave all my cars and my two lawn tractors running at all times. They are always warm and ready to go and my carbon foot print is almost as big as Al Gores.  I am trying.But onto reality.  I have about a 3 mile drive through our development before getting to the highway, so it usually in the warm zone before then.   I agree is is a must to be sure the oil is up to temp before driving aggressively.  Turbo cars general warm up more quickly than non-turbos since the engine oil goes through the turbo housing.Mike",

Also how does this vary from all the modes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's all in your foot work with respect to the right amount of clutch slippage and throttle application.Contrary to what many believe, launching at a higher rpm, rather than lower, typically nets a better launch, but you need to be in tune with how much is enough/too little with the pedals.  Yes, these cars technically can make max torque at sub 2,000 rpms BUT that power is based on full turbo load and maximum boost.  These cars will not make much boost (if any) right at launch and they do not make full boost 1st gear.  Launching a manual on street tires is a fine line between a little spin and just on the verge of a bog.  You'll know you got it right when the tires tramp a bit in 1st.Granted the M2 has a bit more power, I find launching my stock 6MT M235 to be rather easy, but maybe it's from my years of drag racing FWD, AWD, and RWD manuals at the strip.  This is what I do with my M235:1)  DSC Off selected2)  Put the car into 1st and release the clutch just until it's about to catch.3)  Bring the revs up to around 3000-3500rpms and make them bounce a bit.4)  When it's time to go, release the clutch just enough that you feel the car start to roll.  Once you feel it rolling, release the clutch fairly quickly while feeding the gas to keep from bogging.  The rpms need to stay above 3000rpm or so and the slight roll helps plant the tires rather than shocking them with an immediate load from a standstill.  The higher launch rpm and clutch slippage help create some load on the turbo thus getting into boost quicker. You cannot go full throttle at first and do not release completely because you're going to need to feather it a bit.  Once it feels like it's hooking, then you can release the clutch fully and go full throttle.  All this occurs in the first 2 seconds or so of the launch and only midway through 1st will you be able to use full throttle.If the car bogs, then either adjust your clutch release style (i.e., you may be releasing it too quickly and the tires are hooking hard) and/or consider upping your launch rpm.  If you blow the tires off, then reduce the launch rpm down a bit and don't release the clutch as rapidly.",

Once you plugged in, it goes SERVICES mode automatically.\n\nWell that's weird because the BMW diagnostic comp is not able to read from the DME and the only electrical related mod that I have done is the Awron gauge...  if the Gauge was installed incorrectly, it wouldn't have all the data displayed or be able to control the valve right?So I am guessing it's not the installation... do I need to switch the display to the Awron Logo page?\n\nInteresting! Let me comment to this...First of all, your Awron display might not be well installed, because I have exactly the same set up as you (only downpipe with cat right now) and we can read the car without any issues.I had two different BMW computers connected to my car and both can read my car without issues. Double check with your installer, remove the connection of the display and try it again. If it then works, the installer made a mistake installing the display.Secondly, the limp mode coming up, I have exactly the same thing. My messages in the computer are related to overboost. There is too much boost presented and therefore the car goes into limp mode. Limp mode has nothing to do with the CEL messages that the delete-r removes. Your car is overboosting and that is why it might give the messages.In my case I get limp mode messages when I drive between 210 and 260 kmh. Because I am in such high revs and gear, the message pops up. I have not heard about your case that when you rev in high gear it comes up but it could be related.Please keep me informed. If your issue is similar to mine, then please let me know and we will use both our data in the direction of Akrapovic. Now that the sun is back here, I can do a few high speed runs.MR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah its easy to overboost with a catless downpipe on a high gear if going WOT. That is the reason you are getting the limp mode, the car spends too much time overboosting so it thinks there is something wrong and just goes into limp mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "When my CA called and told me a few months ago that my spot had come up for an M2 allocation, I had mixed feelings. I loved everything about the car except for one issue, and it was a big one....relative lack of power. It took me a day to accept the allocation over my initial build, an F80 ZCP. I knew that Dinan had a fully matching warrantied big turbo kit in the making. I thought to myself, this should solve the M2's power issue all the while still being cheaper than my $71k M3 build.The stage 4 kit was installed over the past 2 1/2 days at Otto's of West Chester, a certified Dinan dealer/installer. My SA and I agreed to not rush things and ensure all components were done correctly, thus the longer than usual install time. Ryan, the tech is very methodical and precise (installed my exhaust and intake). He adhered to his initial price install quote which is very commendable. Extra time was performed on this procedure. I picked up my car yesterday and we went for a spirited test drive. As advertised, the car pulls very hard to redline with barely noticeable turbo lag. It's smooth with no peakiness, pretty much like stock. The drivability is cake; power comes on as expected and again, holds to redline. Those who have the sport tuner, I'll equate it to that but bumped up a notch. The intercooler is huge and will help with heat soak during the warmer months. I already felt power being zapped in 60 degree weather on my stock IC.Is it worth the $6000 (includes install)? To me it is. It feels like a BMW OEM kit, at least initially. The MPPK on my old 435i gave 35 HP for $1700 which was solely a software tune. This Dinan package gives ~100 HP for $6k, all fully warrantied. No brainer for me.Those of you on the fence and with the funds, I recommend it. If nothing else, you'll surprise some big, bad M3/4 drivers on the road second guessing their car purchasing decision.Have any questions, feel free to ask....\n\nNice write up! I'm thinking about a Dinan tune, solely based on the warranty!Did you play with any of the handling mods, or just play with the engine?\n\nAwesome! glad to hear you love the kit!\n\nNow on to suspension! =)\n\nAuf:Your post feels like an ad for Dinan and Otto.I assume they gave you the script to adhere to?A better write up would have included:How long have you had your M2 before the modification.What were you driving before?Did you have a dyno done?You say you felt heat soak at 60 degrees. I find that hard to believe.You don't say what was done except that it cost $6k.Sort of a meh review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have before and after dyno graphs?\n\nYour review was nearly useless.Let others comment and you will see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood review but will still get smoked by a F80 with a tune on E85\n\n\n\nBruceM - I appreciate that you felt so compelled to respond and defend AUF's review of Dinan and Otto. The basis of your retort is pure anger, use of name calling and derogatory terms towards me. So in general, you are the ugly one here.  If you dont like my post - skip it.That said, I was simply implying that the posters written stuff did little versus recently published detailed write ups of Stage 4. I was truly hoping that this one would provide more \"owner, details and experience\".My request for comparisons is just that...is the Stage 4 better than the stock car? How many miles (not length of time) has he driven his M2. Has AUF tracked it before and or after?Does he have other 'sports cars' to compare it to so that others can take his review with a comparative basis (hence why many many many professional publications review \"similar cars\" side by side.And I can go on and on...but you dont seem to be able to get past my content...you seem to fixate on perceived tone. But that is your right.  I just wish you didnt call me a d--k....seems harsh and rude.\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce - may the lord be with you",

    "content": "Hi guysi know there has been threads about this but just wanted to share my absolute disgust at this invention, today i picked up a 116i 2017 model here in the Czech Republic, reason being i don't really like the standard breaks on my M2 so i've invested in the Ceramic ones, people may call me crazy but oh well it is after all my choice. so i have this 116i for the next 2 days.Anyway back to my point, the rev matching yes, today as i was driving this Beast ( 109bhp ) in sport + ( which makes absolutely no difference what so ever may i add ) i noticed that when i downshifted the rev counter flew up, and i found out the car has rev matching, now just think how angry this made me in a 116i..... i cannot put into words how angry people who paid top money for an M2 only to find one of the most satisfying things you can do in a car is now being done for youyou no longer get that 5 second feeling that you are the next Lewis Hamilton, you no longer can take a girl for a drive catch a perfect downshift and be like '' you hear that? that's right i am the shit'', like i am sorry but rev matching is one of the worst things i have ever seen installed on a car, its sort of like when you're watching a film with a friend and he has already seen the movie and just before a good part in the film he says '' oh this bit is so funny'', Ahh cheers bro thanks for ruining the whole damn scene.anyway just my 2 cents to this catastrophic creation, and my deep condolences to all M2 Manual owners out there who wanted to go down the Purist route, you have been robbed.CheersKris.\n\nWell, you can always push and hold the traction control button for a few seconds. It turns off all the esc and rev matching.\n\n\n\ntechnically it's true that you can't turn off the rev matching feature in all modes other than the sports+ w/traction off, but you can still rev match yourself.  you CAN rev match before the computer does it for you.  if you do it properly, the computer won't interfere.  just FYI.\n\nI hear you and I'm with you all the way.  That stupid rev matching feature is the most annoying thing to me about my M2.  I drive my car all the time in Sport + with traction turned off.  All the time.  Remember though, it wasn't all that long ago that there were no nannies to turn off, so we drove everything that way.\n\nYou can handle the adversity that comes with the elitism of \"6MT's\"( Fight me )\n\nYou can learn to drive properly and then you'll never notice it as it won't ever kick in\n\nI really like the rev match feature - I'd love to see a back to back track test to see which would result in a faster lap. It's a feature that is becoming more and more commonplace in motorsport using electronic throttles.I work for Jenvey Dynamics - fuel injection throttle body manufacturers, we make a unit to convert traditional cable operated throttle to fly by wire. A lot of our motorsport customers fit these to program things like flat shift, traction control and auto blipping (rev matching) and it regularly results in faster laptimes. I can understand the feeling of less involvement, but purely from a performance perspective it may well be a very positive thing. Maybe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI love rev matching...so much smoother downshifting.\n\nRev-match thread:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1318513\n\nPerfect down-shifts - every time.  I love it!\n\nWasted my time reading that rant. That horse has been beaten to death. BTW I'd be surprised if Hamilton can drive a manual being the video game robot driver he is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm used to rev matching during daily driving anyway because racecar (always got to practice) and I thought I would hate it in the M2 but after the first day I absolutely love it.\n\n\n\nI'm really looking forward to trying it.  I enjoy driving a manual, and I can admit that I never learned to heel-toe.  Does that make me less of a man?  Perhaps, and in that case, I'll accept it.  My favorite color is also pink, so what of it?If rev-matching allows me to drive the car more smoothly, or get more enjoyment out of it, then I'm all for it.  Plus for all the heel-toe'ers out there, it seems like rev-matching doesn't keep you from doing that.",

Dinan stage 1 runs about $1500 an increase of 30 HP.\n\n\n\nWow, this is very interesting.https://www.turnermotorsport.com/p-3...it/?pdk=BgYDAwI've used Turner stuff in the past, and it's always been great.  I have no idea how this guy works, but I'm guessing it's similar to the Dinantronics unit.\n\nHad a Turner tune on my F80 and it works very well.  No issues, ever.\n\nSeems pretty interesting.  I would love to hear from someone that actually used it.  How does it function with aftermarket items installed, ie, HF cat, intake, exhaust?\n\nTMS has had excellent support in my experience.  I used to know a guy who worked for them.  I'll see if I can find out more.Install instructions:https://1c2a8a2161d644d95009-22d26b3...structions.pdfThis is a new unit, and there is not an tech data available to the public as of yet.  I also asked for dyno sheets, and they said they are getting a new dyno installed, or moving it, or something like that.  They said dyno sheets, and tech data will be available shortly.So, this tuner box actually hooks into both TMAP sensors (TB & Manifold) as well as the camshaft position sensor (CPS).It would appear that it's going to be more capable than the JB+ or sport tuner, but less than the Dinatronics Stage 1 piggy-back.Either way, I'd be interested in trying it out.  If their claims are true, and this unit is safer & more reliable than the other 2 options I just listed, then...Max HP gain = 72 hpMax Trq gain = 90 ft-lbsIs decent bang for the buck...\n\nits a stage 1 tune ... for that price would get a stage 2 like the Jb4\n\nI think those numbers are from the other models and not from the M2. Would be great to see m2 numbers\n\n\n\n\n\nMeh, with BM3 out i would not even look at Jb4 that still doesn't have any local testers or proper support yet.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/protuningfr...015377/?type=3\n\n\n\nSorry, didn't realize this was an M2 thread!!!???...\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I haven't looked into access to a dyno yet. I live way out in the country, drive an hour one way to work and my closest dealer is about 56 miles away. I am curious about these apps I'm seeing here on the forums though that show hp, torque and boost though!?... Are they accurate, do they only work and link with specific tunning modules or do they work in conjunction with the car and any Blu Tooth device!?...\n\n\n\nYeah, I know! Unfortunately like I mentioned in my initial post I purchased the Turner Module about a week after buying my car and before I started reading up on my cars potential in these forums. Seems like the JB4 is the way to go if you really wanna get into some serious tuning. I already have the Turner Module now and I'm happy with it, so I'll stick with it for now and focus on upgrading my charge pipe, inner cooler and exhaust system.\n\nKind of a bummer that I paid the same for the Turner Module during a 48hr sale with $150 off as what the JB4 goes for!?...\n\nNow I'm debating on going with a catted down pipe to avoid cel or just get the catless and deal with the cel until I get the JB4 to eliminate it.",

    "content": "Hello,Yesterday I installed akrapovic exhaust system with the remote control and the garage who installed the system told me that I need to visit the dealer to program the modules so the flaps can open and close.Because the original exhaust comes with only one flap which is on the driver side, but the Akrapovic on both side.So I went to BMW garage and they said that they can't do itSo if anyone knows or already installed the system please Advise.Thanks in advance.Khalifa.\n\nIf I were you, I'd ask Akra themselves... although I must admit when I wrote to them to ask them some questions they didn't bother to reply which pissed me off no end.\n\n\n\nI would visit a better installer...With the exhaust there were some cables and two boxes (one CAN-sniffer and one logic box). These are installed in the trunk and take care of all the new modes for the extra exhaust valve and remote. It is clearly stated in the installation manual how to install this, these are available at Akrapovic.com. I didn't get any with my exhaust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the cost of this you could get a cheap daily driver! When the time comes, I'll get out the TIG and some stainless pipe and make my own. I think I'll go from 4 outlets down to two since there is no functional benefit of 4 tips and get rid of all the flappy stuff entirely.\n\n\n\nAll mentioned by Metrickid is true, same for me. Just have it properly installed and have your installer read the damn manual / instructions!Akrapovic has an importer in Arabia or maybe even Qatar, let your installer reach out to them, if he has a hard time understanding what to do. They will definitely help!No need to code anything, if you do not go for a catless downpipe. Valve is not what it seems! There is no need to take the valve control from Akrapovic. The system opens and closes the exhaust at the end when you want it. The exhaust burble and control through the Sport and MDM buttons is not controlled by the valve control from Akrapovic.MR\n\nThis is one of the reasons I would only get Dinan or MPE Exhausts.\n\nThe flaps are easy. Wire them in parallel\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks and I appreciate your comments, the car still in the dealer and I will collect it on Monday and update you.Thanks a lot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIll offer 2k for the akra exhaust\n\n",

    "content": "Yesterday I visited the Akrapovic factory in Slovenia. During the visit, the mechanics installed a titanium evolution exhaust on my BMW M2 Coupe. Next to the exhaust, also a down pipe with catalytic converter and gloss carbon fiber diffuser were installed.The morning started with moving the car inside the factory and raising it so that we could see the stock exhaust. Engineers removed the exhaust and the down pipe from the car so that I could have a closer look at the turbo and the undercarriage of the car. The photos below give a good look at the set up.\n\nThe second step was installing the Akrapovic exhaust, the down pipe and the gloss carbon fiber diffuser. The final result is visible below on the photos.The quality level of this exhaust is one of the finest I have seen. It is almost a piece of art if you look at it. The fit is excellent and the set up works excellent with the car.MR\n\nBefore you are asking why the stickers? I am driving a road rally the next week with Shmee150 and our starting point is in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The tour brings us across the balkan to Italy and France. The stickers will come off in 8 days or so.Now let's discuss the exhaust system as a whole. Interestingly, the system is a lot louder on the outside, but not a lot louder on the inside. Inside the interior, the sounds levels (also because I disengaged ASD) are slightly louder than stock. You hear a higher soundtrack pitch coming from the exhaust and there is a lot more burbling. You can clearly hear the influence of the new set up, but it is never annoying or droning which is what I had hoped for.The cold start up is a lot louder, as expected. The exhaust follows the ECU modes and the modes available via the Sport and Traction button. The sound track of each of these modes is of course louder and especially the 'hidden' exhaust mode via the Traction mode has turned some notches up!Video: before and after!Listening to the sound track, it is a lot more raw, and feels quite common to the set up available for the BMW M4. More raw, lower in tone, more burbles, more volume, never droning or annoying. A clear difference between stock and Akrapovic is noticeable by ear, but as stated above this is mainly the case outside and not inside.Another noticeable point is the fact that you really clearly hear the woosh sound from the turbo after lift off. It is way more noticeable than before and it is a nice extra to the exhaust set up.Overall, it feels like a really thoroughly engineered set up both on sound (inside/outside) and build quality. You really feel like it has some decent engineering all across the board. The materials are wonderful and the sound is exactly what you expect without it being annoying. All in all exactly the set up that Akrapovic wants to achieve with their systems.Early next year I will install the catless downpipe and make a comparison for you guys, so that you know how loud that is. For now feel free to ask any questions or let me know what you think of it. I will try to reply and answer much as I can.MR\n\nMan... those decals\n\n\n\nNice! Does the Akrapovic exhaust have a remote to control the valves like the MPE?If yes, were the videos with the valves open or closed?\n\nThat system is really a work of art, thanks for posting MR.\n\n4 questions:1) I heard Akrapovic uses a remote controller to open/close valves, now did you just state it automatically follow stock driving mode?2) Is your car with tune or not? Does it throw a CEL without a tune?3) Is the stock exhaust sound in your comparison video running with valves open or closed?4) Apparently Akrapovic uses a split dual pipe (not a true dual pipe system, technically) configuration as opposed to the single pipe found in m2 stock and many other N55 applications. Is a noticeable torque loss at down low being felt?Thanks.\n\n\n\nCongratulations with the new exhaust! With all the exposure Akrapovic is getting on forum's, You Tube, etcwhere everything is posted about this M2 exhaust you guys probably made a very nice deal with themGood for you and well done\n\nWhy is there a dent along the left midpipe on the akrapovic?\n\nIt makes me want this system!  Amazing quality.\n\n\n\nFantastic stuff and info. Thanks!CheersRobin\n\nAnd the final video:MR\n\n\n\nsounds badass\n\n\n\nFew more photos shared by Akrapovic\n\nAwesome!  Thank you for sharing and posting up photos and videos of the system.  Great insight into Akrapovič and what makes them special, thank you\n\n\n\nSubscribed to this thread. Amazing photos, video, and writeup. Looking for to helping other M2 owners acquire this truly spectacular exhaust system.",

    "content": "Enjoy!Original article here:http://autoweek.com/article/drive-re...ew-dinan-s2-m2Dinan S2 BMW M2 first drive: A favorite gets faster, but at what cost?WE TAKE A SHORT, THRILLING DRIVE IN THE LATEST DINAN BMW CREATIONAPRIL 14, 2017When last we checked in at Dinan in 2015, founder and owner-operator for 36 years Steve Dinan had sold the company and left for Ganassi. He stayed on as a consultant to the entity that bore his name, and much of the staff remained in place to do the testing, tuning and development work, but still, things could've been a little different. Then last year, one year after Steve Dinans departure, Autoweek tested a Dinan S3 M235i and found things mostly to our liking, so maybe all is well.Then a week ago, a friend at Dinan called and asked if Id like to drive a Dinan S2 M2. With your best interests in mind, dear reader, I said yes.The S2 M2 (or M2 S2, depending on which sheet of Dinan material youre reading) starts with the same engine in the Dinan S3 M235i, called the N55 internally at BMW. Dinan then adds its Big Turbo Kit, carbon-fiber cold-air intake, Dinantronics Stage 4 tuning unit, dual-core intercooler and free-flow stainless-steel full exhaust with resonator delete, so you get that nice burble when you get downshifts and stuff like that, the rep says. In stock form, the BMW M2 makes 365 hp at 6,500 rpm and 343 lb-ft of torque from 1,400 to 5,560 rpm (369 lb-ft in overboost mode). With the above Dinan equipment installed, the 3.0-liter straight six peaks at 446 hp and 455 lb-ft (no corresponding engine speeds were listed with the Dinan numbers). So its 81 hp and 112 lb-ft stronger with Dinan.Keeping all that power on the ground is a Dinan adjustable coilover suspension system with monoball bushings, lightweight adjustable sway bars, rear suspension link kit, adjustable camber plates and tension strut ball-joint kit.The rear toe links (are particularly beneficial), claims the Dinan guy. Because theyre pretty tail-happy from the factory, its just a little loose in the back, so those toe links actually stiffen up the rear end quite a bit and make it so that things not dancin around quite as much. Not as prone to oversteer.And those springs?One big thing they do for this car is they use linear springs instead of progressive like they are from the factory, so it actually makes it ride a little softer -- so the car seems to kind of squat a little more and doesnt get quite as stiff as it goes down. Its the same spring rate all the way through.The test car also had upgraded Brembo GT brakes measuring 380-by-34 millimeters front and 380-by-28 millimeters rear, inside Forgeline Forged Satin Gunmetal GA1R wheels wrapped in Pirelli PZero Corsas 265/30ZR19 front 285/30ZR19 rear.Theyre like 60 treadwear, nice and sticky.There are also some cosmetics: BMW M Performance carbon-fiber rear spoiler, mirror caps and black kidney grille, as well as Dinan floor mats and pedal-pad set.Other than that, it's really straightforward.The ExecutionDue to scheduling constraints -- caused by an appointment with a much more boring car -- I had only about an hour or so to actually drive the S2 M2. Luckily, there's a road near where I picked it up that was just right for it, but to get to that road meant driving it like a normal car at normal g loads. It was there in that civilized environment that two things became clear: 1) the Dinan free-flow stainless-steel exhaust with black tips is way too loud for everyday driving, and 2) the imperfections of normal street driving are beyond what most folks would tolerate in a car used for everyday commuting. Freeing up an exhaust might give you five or 10 more horsepower, but is it worth the loud frapping brabble that resulted here? Maybe if you are younger than me (just about everyone), but it was louder than Id like it to be. You can order your Dinan any way you want it, so do without the exhaust.And the suspension? The coilovers, sway bars and camber plates are all adjustable. So if youre driving back and forth to work all week, you can set it up one way, make it more compliant as they say, then, when you get to the track, slam that sucker down.I got to the equivalent of a track soon enough: a short, sweet mountain pass that consists of 25 beautiful curves, two of them 180-degree hairpins like they used to have at Long Beach and Detroit when those street courses hosted F1. After timing the entry to maximize breaks in the traffic flow, I had at it.Here, the car was perfect. Perfectly perfect. Hammer on the gas, ease onto the brakes, ease the wheel around, feel the meaty 60-rated rubber bite and push and pull the car around, then gently press the throttle back down. Repeat. 25 times over, 25 back. Who needs a one-week loan? Well, OK, I would have liked a one-week loan, but only if it was on this little section of road. I wouldnt have wanted to drive it all the way home and then all the way back, at least not with this exact setup.The VerdictThe M2 might be the best car BMW makes. It's the closest to the original E30 M3 everyone recalls so fondly from way back in the 80s, except that the M2 has modern comforts like airbags, crumple zones and satellite radio. In fact, the M2 might be the most fun you can have in a modern car, even when you consider bang for the buck. What would compete with it for fun-to-drivedness? The Audi RS3, Subaru WRX STI and maybe the Subaru BRZ/Toyota 86? Or the Mustang, Camaro, Corvette  OK, there are a few things out there at just above or significantly below the M2s starting price of $53,495 that are also great fun to drive. But would I recommend spending the $28,358 to get all this Dinan stuff on a BMW M2?That's a more complicated question. Do without the cosmetic items and maybe even the wheels and tires, which would drop the price by eight grand. Dinan is proud that their tuning and suspension setups are warrantied and available through BMW dealers, so youre getting that, plus the almost 40 years of experience that went into it. Steve Dinan himself is supposed to be still consulting for the company that bears his name, but he's no longer with Ganassi and now spends a lot of his time at SD AutoTech in Mountain View and San Jose, California, installing Dinan kits on BMWs, among other things. Dinan the company, meanwhile, has expanded to include kits for Mercedes, Audi and even VW, and it now sells parts online and through distributors instead of solely through dealers.None of which answers the question, Should you do this to your already fantastic car? The answer: Well, sure you should, do it!BMW M2 MSRP: $51,700 BASEMPG: 18 / 26 CITY / HWYMark VaughnMARK VAUGHN - West Coast Editor Mark Vaughn covers all car things west of the Mississippi from his Autoweek lair high above the LA metropolis.ON SALE: NowBASE PRICE: $53,495 (stock BMW M2)AS TESTED PRICE: $82,358DRIVETRAIN: 3.0-liter straight six, 7-speed dual clutch transmission, rwdOUTPUT: 446 hp, 455 lb-ftOPTIONS: Engine $6978, Suspension $4642, Wheels/Tires/Brakes $16,738, Trim itemsPROS: Much better track and canyon-carving performanceCONS: Big bucks, harsh ride unless you're willing to change settings",

    "content": "Has anyone experienced a battery/power problem with the Bluetooth valve control module. I changed the battery in mine because I thought that was the problem but for some reason it's not turning \"on\" or turning the valves to open or closed when I double click it. I know it's supposed to blink 5 times when it opens the valves and it's supposed to stay lit red for 5 seconds when I'm closing the valves.It's also weird and I'm not sure what this is but it'll randomly blink twice or three times very very fast out of no where now. That's why I'm thinking something may have happened to it. Idk what but something is definitely very wrong. This all happened after I had a shop install my VRSF race core intercooler. They installed that and I had problems with my Chargepipe popping off because the angle it was installed at by the horrible shop I used to go to was wrong and it was restricting the angle by the throttle body and not allowing it to be installed all the way in and be held by the clip provided. They also \"forgot\" to take the o-ring off of the oem Chargepipe intercooler side and put it on the aftermarket Chargepipe and install it that way. So basically I've been driving for 3-4 months with no o-ring on the smaller intercooler side of the Chargepipe and I was told this probably caused a leak in the piping and probably why my car didn't feel 100% right and we couldn't figure out why until they saw that the o-ring wasn't taken off the oem Chargepipe and used on the aftermarket one. Thanks to Thiago I brought it to a competent shop that understood the basics of installing chargepipes and intercoolers and they pointed the problem out immediately and fixed the angle and put the Chargepipe on to the throttle body side tight and secure and put the o-ring on where it should've been this whole time. And since then I haven't had a problem.No back to the problem I'm having now- the Bluetooth controller for the MPE isn't working. It's not working at all whether I press it 2 times like I should or 10 times. It randomly blinks out of no where but the valves are NEVER opened and never open at all due to not being able to use this controller. Idk if anyone had any ideas that I can look into or bring to my shop that knows what they're doing and tell them what the problem is. But if I can find something out here before having them check everything and go nuts I'd rather try to find out here first. Thank you all for the help in advance and I Hope someone knows what is happening. ??\n\nhave you check your trunk? there is an on/off button that might have been switched off by the shop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Great! Limited edition then.Seriously, are you f*kin kidding me?In BMW's opinion, everything about m2 need an immediate update or correction as I'd like to put it, including the car itself!\n\n\"The noise is too loud\". It's supposed to be a more aggressive exhaust than the stock system which itself, is for an M car and thus, pretty freaking loud. Have consumers really become this soft? As for the supposed droning issue, this is the first I've heard about it.\n\nGlad I have mine already I love the drone!!\n\nGreat if it's true. Didn't sound too great with valves open.\n\nGlad i haven't ordered one as yet then if this is the case, also wonder if they will address the rattling on cold start I've heard a number of people comment about.\n\nInteresting to see how public opinion on the MPE has shifted.  A year ago, it was the shiznit, with everybody saying it was a must-buy.  Now, all I read is how bad the drone is.\n\nI wonder if others are having the problem I have of the stupid valves closing intermittently.  (instructions say the only two things that cause them to close are you manually pushing the button twice on the remote to close them, or you turning the car off--mine close at random while driving and it's REALLY annoying because it defeats the point of having the exhaust)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove my MPE. No drone on mine\n\n\n\nNo drone on my exhaust and it sounds great when  fully open.. Not sure on the open close issues though... I ain't noticed anything but will keep an eye on it.\n\nDoes the stock single pipe system of M2 has a mounting point in the middle section?\n\nHow reliable is this information?I've placed an order recently and will speak to the dealer to find out if it can be delayed until the replacement is available.\n\nSpoke to my dealer and apparently all MPE orders (not in stock) are cancelled.They will look into it, so potentially there might be a revised MPE after all.\n\nThis irritates me to no end due to my thread here:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1313280I haven't received a response from the manufacturer.I hope the Akra is as good as advertised so I can be rid of this headache. The MPE was extremely disappointing, even though it sounds so good otherwise.\n\nMaybe they'll drop the price by a 1000 and get rid of the Bluetooth and integrate with the idrive too. ... or not\n\nWonder if they'll replace older versions with the newer ones, even if it's some sort of retrofit of the muffler>tailpipe section\n\n",

    "content": "Newbie from UK here!I purchased my car in December 2016, manual in mineral grey. Nothing much to say but stunning. In my forty years of driving I've had some cars, a lot of cars including lots of classics and now this little beauty! Having previously owned an E46 M3 I knew that the experience and feel of the gear changing was going to be abysmal and true enough I was not surprised to find that the same performance of gear change was exactly the same on the M2..........rubbish. Lots of research, including on this site, brought me to UUC Motorwerks who then kindly redirected me to the UK distributor called CA Technologies. Deal was done for the purchase at a mere 440 of our lovely English pounds. I have to say that the product is one of precision engineering and the installer of the unit to my car commented as to the quality. He is well placed at making such positive comments in that he is a Rolls Royce trained engineer. His team took their time to install the short shifter which involved removing part of the exhaust, propshaft, heat shield etc. One thing that they did undertake when installing the unit was to \"torque\" all the screws which other installers would simply not do.That's the beauty of using a properly trained and genuinely qualified \"old school\" motor engineer!After parting with the required monies for the labour for installation and then driving the car away for my trip home, I genuinely thought \"this is noticeably excellent\". The difference in gear change between the stock and the UUC short shifter is remarkable. The gear changes feel precise and obviously shorter whereas the stock original is all over the place and feels like a wooden spoon in treacle.If I were to recommend one modification to the M2, then this would be it. We can all talk about lowering kits, replacement mirrors and so on, but trust me if you do one modification it has to be this, provided of course that your car is manual!\n\nI have the UUC short shifter as well and I think it is a major upgrade to the shifting experience. Stock was very rubbery. I don't really care about the shortened throw or the height. I left my UUC at the default max height. I care about precision of the shifter. And the sound it makes with the ball bearings is very satisfyingThe install is a royal PITA. I had a trusted shop install it. Don't even think about it unless you have a lift.\n\n\n\n\n\nI concur.  I added an Ultimate Clutch pedal to the experience along with the UUC unit, and now I'm a happy camper....\n\nI'd love either the UCC clutch pedal or short shifter but having a hard time finding a place I'm confident will do a good jobAny suggestions for what I should be looking for?\n\nIf you have basic tools and mechanical inclination, the clutch pedal is a pretty easy install as a DIY.",

    "content": "Just got home a bit ago with my newly installed Dinan system. It is the entire catback set up.Its tough owning an M2 because any modifications you may want to try, odds are you're the only one in town with an M2. So without getting to check one out in person, I ordered from Dinan. Nice people, very helpful. Fast free shipping.First impression on appearance- Looks much better than stock IMO. I didn't think I'd like the black finishers, but I do. They look good. Understated yet aggressive. Plus probably easier clean up.Sound- Obviously much better. I have only heard it from inside the cabin and while outside at idle. Sound is like stock but amplified and deeper. Almost makes it sound cammed a little. Much better rumble at low speed/RPM. WOT honestly, the CTS intake is what I hear most of. Lots of overrun burbles and pops with the whistle of the intake. Bottom line, sounds much more serious. If you think stock is too tame, this may be for you. I almost thought that it was a little too quiet. My wife assures me that she thinks its way too loud. BMW SA's loved it.I wasn't sure how the comfort mode would sound, with the valve closed. At idle and low speed it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. When you give it some throttle, then the difference is easy to hear. Much more muted. In fact, I'd say that comfort is maybe just a little more tame than Sport + on the stock system. Not much pop or overrun.As a frame of reference here are a few comparisons to some of my recent ridesM5 V10 with muffler delete--wife says the M2 is louderM235i with MPE-- Way quieter than M2STi with DP and exhaust-- Wife says the M2 isn't as loudTried to get descriptive for people stuck on the fence about which system to choose\n\nThank you for the review. I have been leaning towards the Dinan muffler but I am on the fence if I want to spring for the resonator delete at the same time for the fear that it will drone too much.Have you noticed any difference in drone at highway speeds and/or light throttle?Post some pictures!\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,So if you were looking at a used 2017 M2 with 4k miles on it, and saw this under the hood, what would be some of the possibilities on why the engine cover and other plastic covers in the engine bay have these spots?It's out of state, so while I am looking for a way for an independent tech to inspect the vehicle, thought I'd post and see if anyone might have some ideas as well.Thanks in advance....-dk\n\nCoolant is one in my mind since it happened to me in a previous car and looked like that. Next would be whatever cleaner they planned on using got applied on a hot engine cover and wasn't immediately wiped away.\n\n\n\nOk promising responses so far. I was worried it was oil, like maybe the engine was ran with oil cap not tightened.\n\nIt could also be the hydrocarbon wax that the factory applies to the entire car for shipping to avoid rust etc. Typically during pre-delivery this is washed away by the dealership. If not removed, after about 1200miles the engine heat hardens the wax to something that can't be removed.\n\nToo white to be oil but not crusty or white enough to be dried coolant. Coolant tends to spray directionally from the leaks source as well. For it to be all over the valve cover it would also have to be literally everywhere including hood. Probably some kind of coating or low quality product like armor all. Go to a car wash and use spot free rinse from high up. Wipe down immediately. You could try some \"back to black\" type product as well once it's all cooled down. It tends to hold up well in heat cycles.\n\nThanks guys. Sounds like a cleaning job gone wrong. Not surprising. Definitely better than any of the alternatives.\n\n\n\nJust wanted to say thanks all for the input and your comments -- it really helped with my concerns.I had a bad experience with an M4 I bought which had been money shifted (but luckily I returned it and didn't get stuck), so was extra cautious with the M2.I was able to confirm that the spots were due to cleaning product of some kind on a hot engine.Grateful actually for the problems with the M4, because I pulled the trigger on this M2 and I think I will love to drive this car a lot more than the M4 and won't miss the extra fluffyness of the full leather since the M2 is just so much fun to drive.

The current X4M40i shares its engine with the current M2 which is N55 based.Since the X4 is mostly a \"coupe\" version of the X3, one could easily assume that the this new B58 based engine will make into to the next X4M40i.  Since the X4M40i and M2 are engine \"kissing cousins\", could this possibly be shared with the LCI M2?http://www.bmwblog.com/2017/04/07/20...formance-data/Not looking to be flamed, just wondering.Thoughts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the 2018 model gets the b58, then maybe i should sell my '17 M2 and get that one.\n\nGuys/GalsA touch of searching will tell you that most people believe (with lots of proof) that the 2018 M2 will have the N55 engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX3M40i is not the real M version of the X3 though right?  BMW are going with the philosophy that every model that has an upgraded engine and a Msports package gets an M before itM235iM240iM550ietc etcThis is the equivalent of Audi's S Line.  But the real m cars have the M before for sedans and M after for suvs which is the equivalent of Audi's RS line.  Audi's nomenclature makes more sense, but BMW want to milk that ///Marketing.The X3M is rumored to get the S55.  The X3M40i based on this philosophy would get the current 6 cylinder engine which is the B58.The M2 and X4M40i are cars that didn't particularly follow the mold, but I don't think the B58 was ready in time for the X4M40i and we all know that the it's unusual that the M2 didn't get a customized engine.  It's possible that with the X3M we may also see an X4M but at this point I doubt it.\n\n\n\nAs an audiophile I find it hard to discern the sound of an N55 with a B58. The B58 sounds roughly the same, albeit not as loud, but that could be due to the exhaust setup and not the engine itself. The S55 has a distinct tone compared to the other engines. The only information available right now is a reliable source that's been quoted several times in this thread divulged it will still carry the N55. Unless there’s a leak we’re stuck waiting on the official word from BMW. If I were to bet on it I’d go with the N55.\n\n",

However, on my 85 635csi i have an upgraded radiator and run Evans water-less coolant to keep temps down in case i get stuck in traffic on a hot day. i know this info probably doesn't help but maybe replacing the thermostat with (after a quick search) mishimoto low temp one which opens at 74 degrees would be worth a shot since they aren't too expensive. if that doesn't help run an upgraded coolant like Evans.\n\nAdd some water wetter and call it a day.

When I asked for more details, the representative speaking to me wasn't aware of what the mechanic/garage did. I'm going tomorrow to see what they did.The flow is definitely messed up by now and this has to be exchanged. My question is, is this part of the MPE or is the MPE just the catback and this is a stock pipe which they have in stock maybe? I'm expecting tomorrow they tell me we just tightened it and it's okay now. I will insist on exchanging either the full exhaust or just this pipe if it's not part of the MPE.Thanks,\n\nNothing?\n\nAfter the clamp is MPE. Before is stock front pipe. Hope it helps.BTW, in your first video, what's causing the pipe to hit the plate automatically? I didn't think someone is pushing gas pedal from the sound.\n\nThis is actually a design flaw of mpe. Nth can be done about it. You see there are only 2 hangers for mpe and is apparently not enough to hold the pipe. The pipe will drop to the metal plate underneath as shown in your first video.This causes a vibration noise inside the car when cold start as the pipe hit the underneath metal plate.  I guess that's one of the reason they are now making mpe version 2.Wt my shop did is to push the pipe in a bit further so the metal plate will fit the hollow part of the pipe better. So far no more vibration noise for me.For you second video just tighten the cf tip more. That will do\n\nThat is why Akrapovic uses the mounting points aimed for the M3/M4 exhaust (and other?) too... No rattle.\n\n\n\nthis pre revised exhaust is crap. watch the exhaust tipsthey're releasing a new one in March i think. replace it with that one.\n\nFirst the cracking MPE for E92 M3, and now this. M Performance parts were supposed to be OEM quality, but their design team is a joke. I wonder what hacks they outsourced it to.\n\nThe ding or recess in the pipe, you are referring to, is there by design, it's not damaged. There is nothing wrong with the exhaust, but the installation... well that's just another story. Take it back to the dealer and get it fixed, looks like a 10 year old installed it. The exhaust should be rock solid, I have no issues with mine at all.\n\ni only have 130 miles on my car but the MPE was port installed and has been rock solid for 2 weeks.  No rattles, no issues.  I wasn't able to confirm anything regarding a new version for March with anyone at my dealership.\n\nSo the dealer is insisting that there is nothing wrong with the exhaust and they just put it back in place. Should I insist on getting it replaced? I believe this will affect the airflow and probably performance right? Please see video to see the ding. I'm back at the service center now and insisted that the mechanic take another look so I can show him what I mean.Thoughts? Should I let this go?\n\nDid you read the comments? It is supposed to that the indentation. It should be hung a little better though.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have worked out a possible solution with my garage. They are going to weld another \"hangers\" to my exhaust to see if that works. Will let you guys know later.\n\nGood news. After 2 weeks of testing there is no more vibration inside car after welding!! At the end we didn't weld a new \"hangers\" but instead weld the connection between the mp pipe and original pipe. The downside is if I wanna change to other exhaust in the future we will have to cut the pipe. Will upload photo later to show the position we weld.\n\nI have a question for the MPE wire installation.From MPE unboxing image, I only see two cables go to the left and right actuators. But what about OEM wire which located in the driver's side, How will this wire go?",

Who's had a tune done and what dyno improvement did you get?  How did it effect street and track driving?  I'm looking for the optimum tune to add say 50/60hp at the wheels retaining originally street smooth drivability.  Appreciate hearing your experience.\n\nSo I'm going to save you some backlash my friend, I'm a fairly new member myself and I know the crowd can get rough. I lurked this sight for a year before I had a deposit on my M2.  In the beginning most new to the form spent that time tracking there build and waiting patiently/bitching about delays, slowly new mods and development started to unfold. Take sometime to do research on here and all the questions you have will be answered. There is very short temperamental members and some that are down right caring & awesome people.  Search then question, If I can I'll help, but I'm no expert.My long answer to your initial inquiry is 50/60 WHP is just not feasible with a engine tuner/ECU Mod alone.  You will need several other supporting mods to accomplish that and a Pro-Tune.  Off the top of my head parts and tune will cost over to 2K without labor, and I think I'm being conservative. Your talking over 410WHP & 460WTQ without crazy mixtures of alternative fuels. While some might argue that obtaining those numbers is not so far fetched I will disagree. I personally believe it will cost some $ to do it right & reliable.  Enjoy your new car!\n\nThanks MSULLY.  In Melbourne we have 98 octane fuel readily available so that may help.  AC Schnitzer, for one, advertise 420 hp (compared with 365 stock at the flywheel) from their ECU tune.   And yes, $2,000 plus is what I would expect to pay for a proper job.\n\n\n\nBMW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlenty of theories out there as to why; I don't know which of them are correct.I do feel lucky that the car wash where I take my car has unleaded 100 octane race gas, as does a nearby 76 station.\n\n\n\nI will start by saying no company claim that their tune will not void warranty. Some will offer you their own warranty, if BMW refuses to fix the car for free.There is no best tune. It depends on what you are looking for, your mods and fuel\n\nThe 335i is a normal N55 the M135/235i and M2 is just software tuned versions of this engine. As said in the first post all your answers are in here and you are not limited to the information on the M2 forumI think around 400whp (~15psi) is possible if the HPFP agrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks VF-Engineering.

    "content": "Sorry to start a new thread for this, I asked in other threads without any luck. Does anyone know if the BT remote control is an optional accessory that can be purchased but not required to open/close the valves? I mean would it still open/close with the Sport/Sport plus settings and it's something extra to open the valves in non-sport mode? Or would you always need it to open and close the valves. I found mixed facts about this, it said \"optional\" in some threads and in others, people were complaining about if the remote was at home you would not enjoy the exhaust fully. Does anyone have more information about this?I love both sounds, the OEM has a lot of rumble and the MPE magnifies the spool so beautifully. I am very interested in the MPE but if the remote has to be used every time you want to enjoy the full blast then it's a deal breaker for me. I love the built in option of operating the exhaust with the driving mode settings.Thanks in advance.Oh and here is my spec's sheet, is this the equivalent of \"Exec\" in the USA? In Kuwait you don't get to choose much, just the color, transmission and if you want a sunroof. I see most of the specs of the Exec minus the heated steering wheel which is not required here.\n\nThe remote is mandatory to operate the valves.Q: How do valves operate on the M Performance Exhaust?A:Valves are solely driver-controlled using an included bluetooth remote (see photo of exhaust remote from a MINI, which the M2 remote will resemble). The exhaust valves do not automatically open or close at a certain RPM.[From Jason: the remote may come in packaging which should fit in the cupholder to act conveniently as a remote holder]SauceFor more info:sticky,MP parts\n\n\n\n\n\nGood question. I am too wondering, when equipped with the MPE, if there will be different sounds whether in Comfort, Sport or Sport+, or it will only have the Sport or Track buttons from the MPE...From my understanding, the BT controls only the exhaust valve, which would disable the mode buttons valve.To sum up:- with MPE: valve closed in SPORT and valve open in TRACK- with OEM: valve closed in Comfort, valve open with rpm in Sport and Sport +Please correct if I am wrong!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI reviewed many MPE videos, and I really think it's not worth the current price...It's not drastically louder compared to stock, and the difference is only noticeable at higher rpm.\n\nAny clarity on this now that more users received there cars?\n\n\n\nI believe the mpe itself has 2 mode. Default is sport. When turn on by bt, it changes to track. This is independent of the driving mode (comfort, sport, sport +)\n\nI have the exhaust. This is the simplest way to explain it.  It works exactly like the stock one if you don't use the remote. Quiter in comfort, louder in sport/sport +.   Track Mode opens the valves in the outside pipes which bypass the muffler making it louder but works in the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt happened once as I remember. One of the reasons I put my MPE in track mode permanently by disconnecting module-to-battery wire.BT signal is not reliable these days. I believe someone will work out some way making it follow stock valve behavior.\n\n\n\nI had my MPE installed at the port and have driven approximately 600 miles to date.  A few times a week I will put the MPE into track mode and luckily haven't experienced any issues with the valves closing on their own.  My build date was in Dec/Jan so maybe it was an issue with earlier versions but can't confirm this to be the case.Agree with others above, the sound is incredible and so far I have set off a neighbors Maserati alarm twice (inside a parking garage) and scared numerous people walking through the neighborhood with rev matched downshifts as I approach stop signs.Expensive but worth it in my opinion.",

Is there not a little left in the N55 that the engineers could tweak?\n\nTurbo is already maxed out and car will overheat using existing hardware - hence temporary \"overboost\". So no, nothing to \"tweak\".  Power limitation has nothing to do with the N55 engine, but rather restricted air flow into the engine combined with inadequate cooling. So with a tiny turbo being run outside of its efficiency zone and a tiny M235i intercooler you build up heat fast on boost. M2's stock fueling can handle something like 80hp over current levels of airflow.\n\nThe true i only do the PPK for the sound, but i think this car have the PPK alreadyM\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Thought you guys might want to look at my graphs from my first dyno on the car over at European Auto Source.First off, big shout out to the guys at SSR Performance who pretty much put together all my stuff, and ProTuningFreaks (bootmod3)!  I had a lot of questions and both were great at helping me out, so thanks guys.Background on my car, it's a '17 LBB M2 DCT, pretty much full bolt on minus the exhaust.  I'm using the Active Autowerke stepped IC, Dinan intake, Evolution Racewerks catless downpipe and their charge pipe, and Fuel It!'s LPFP and Port Injection kit.  Was using full e85 but didn't like the MPG so I plan on sticking to e50 for now.Anyways on to the good stuff.  Temperature was a little warmer today in Southern California in the low 70s.  I was going to take video of the car on the dyno but I forgot I actually needed to use my phone to log using bootmod3, so sorry I don't have any pics or video of the car getting dyno'd.Here's a picture though of the graph:420 WHP, 458 TQ Port Injection e50 FBO minus exhaust, stock turboWith my setup I could go more aggressive with the tune and prob get close to 450 whp but I don't want to stress everything with the extra heat everything will make.My plans now are probably to go with a Pure Stage 2, but I'm still on OEM wheels so I might go with an 18\" wheel setup, maybe some Volk wheels.  The car definitely feels fast but I already feel like I could always use more power.  Thanks again to SSR Performance, ProTuningFreaks (thx Dzenan) and European Auto Source for the dyno.\n\nThank you for sharing, did you do a baseline dyno?\n\nNo, unfortunately.  I think other people that dyno'd there with a stock m2 were getting 340ish WHP but I didn't ask about too much details other than looking at their graphs.  I think I saw one with 350 whp but I'm not sure what was on the car.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongrats guys!SSR PerformanceproTUNING FreaksJaydoski\n\nDang 357 hp to the wheel with just an exhaust is pretty good!

Was following your thread closely also, you basically got what I'm missing and  I got what you're missing!  This thread is to be continued, as soon as I get in my Pure S2.\n\n\n\nGuessing even with ethanol at your power range the stock turbo is pretty much done unless you wanna go numbers chasing. Nice curve, Im sure the car is plenty more fun.I just dont wanna go with port injection and I have similar mods as you and an machining my own turbo inlet pipe. Cant see spending $150 on pure's when its much cheaper to make. Do you think the inlet pipe would have freed up more HP?\n\n\n\n\n\nOP, you mixed 91+e85 right?If so, then there would be some more gains with 93+e85for those wondering.\n\nGood numbers, perfect numbers for this little car 450-500///Can't wait to tune my car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I was going to see what Dinan was going to release, but I figured what the heck, it's only $199, if I don't like it I can resell it. Was super happy with my JB4 on my M5 and Burger always has high quality, NO issues. First off they LIED about the 60 second install. It took me 80 seconds because I contemplated 20 sec. about the possibility of breaking the plug. But it was an incredibly easy install. I always instinctively put my lil' beast in Sport+ as soon as I start up, but because I swore I screwed up the install (it was too easy!), I just drive away. Initially I thought ok, it's got a decent increase, especially for the price. But then I realized my exhaust was quieter than normal. Put it in Sport+ mode, idiot! O.M.G. This thing came absolutely ALIVE! Especially midrange and above. That was my main complaint, that the engine thrust would \"peter out\" over 5500 rpm. But now it pulls HARD to redline. And my ECU hasn't even adapted yet! Now full disclosure, I am running the Active Autowerke intercooler with 93 octane gas, but DAMN, this thing HAULS now! Absolutely INCREDIBLE value at this price point. Now I may still go with another tune, but it had better offer a lot more ROI than this thing offers.\n\nFSocietyI'm ordering one for the X4.\n\n\n\nVery interesting. I too was going to hold off, but at this price point, why not? Especially since BMS is refunding me for their intake.

Mix in octane booster or e85 and it's another story.\"So, if like me you don't have access to 93 and don't want to mess with complicated mods and fuel mixing, it looks like tuning is not much of an option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs an intercooler upgrade necessary for this (or any of the tunes available)?\n\nDid you use it as it came or did you turn up the additive adjustment inside?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso installed the JB+ and it went very quickly on Monday but yesterday Friday I get a check engine light. I'm using 93, get my code reader out and a misfire code  comes up and clear that but then get a code error and a F112 code up. So I disconnect the JB+ and take it off and the check engine light goes away. Any idea's before I reinstall??\n\nInteresting. Been running it for a week with no codes.",

    "content": "Big thanks to Mike at Extreme and the guys at BMS for answering all of my questions.I was hoping to go simple on my M2. I paid  for an extended factory warranty. And while my dealership is pretty cool with mods, I still wanted to keep it low key. I have a bad habit of tuning my cars as soon as I get them. I wanted to avoid an entire piggy back system like the JB4 just for simplicity sake. Thought I'd go JB+ for a few more easy ponies. All the smart people I talked to advised against this for safety reasons. Said if you're gonna do it, just get the JB4. Less risk. So I guess I'll wait till I get bored and then go JB4So for now, think Ill put on my BMS intake, BMS can flap module and a full Dinan exhaust. So basically sound modsMy dealership doesn't do Dinan mods. Found a dealership about 50 miles north that does. Said to order it through them, takes about a week. Then schedule an appointment for install. Seems pretty simple. Anyone go this route with a BMW dealership?Also thinking about eventually doing a sports cat. My dealership says they're fine with mods, but did give me a warning. Said that they'll be happy to replace anything, but when BMW sees big repairs like engines, turbos, etc, they start to ask questions and want to interrogate the computer stuff themselvesIll see how long I can hold out\n\nI'd like to hear the logic behind less risk with the JB4 than with the JB+.\n\nThe common theme seemed to be that the car with its stock tune is not able to cope with much more boost. The JB4 allows allows revised tunes\n\n\n\nIt seems that you'd want the JB4 when modding fueling, DP, or turbo. But for otherwise stock, including any other intake or exhaust mods, the JB+ would have less risk simply because the reliable factory tune with its safety features is being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Based on other's experience I have a Fabspeed sport cat on order and a Wagner evo 2 intercooler waiting for install.  Also have a Pure inlet to go on the turbo so air in and out as well as exhaust out will see the best possible paths.  This is my DD and not headed to the track anytime soon.  Most of my driving life is below 4000 rpm so a lagging turbo that delivers after 5000 is of no interest.  Since the ECU is a learning and adapting device, do I need bother with a piggyback or tune if the engine sees lower IATs and higher boost at the same rpm?  I am not really interested in meth or e50.  The Dinan turbo seems like a clone of the Pure stage 1 and I have not yet seen a before and after dyno showing the at wheel results.  In Dinan's chart it seems like there is no difference until after 4500 which is great for racing but not a draw for me.Anyone have success with a piggyback or tune on a setup as I describe? Not looking for remarkable power, just smooth delivery as the RPMs increase on 93 octane.\n\n\n\nalso, if lag is a concern, I'm wondering why you went with evo2 over evo1 fmic?\n\nEvo2 will require a remap due to the pressure drops. Go for evo1 if you stay in stock tune as it has the same pressure characteristic as the OEM part\n\n\n\nI've put a Wagner Evo II Comp as last upgrade on my M2 (Remus cat back and HJS 300 cell dp, stock ECU) and I didn't notice any pressure drops on the Bimmerlink gauge that I use to check (13.5 psi max after and before in the same conditions, 500ft over the sea). At least a very very slight lag but IAT dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn stock or lightly tuned cars, i recommend EVO 1On FBO cars, EVO 2That being said, user will not notice any pressure drop even if car is stock and they have EVO 2\n\nWhat kind of tune would make a difference with the standard turbo?  The Dinan stage 1 is capped out at 2.5# and Dinan themselves say they don't ever test with an altered downpipe, so no idea whether their tune will learn to accept the more free flowing exhaust or the more easily accessed inlet air.  JB4?  I don't know anything about their tune or whether it will alter the on board fueling to accommodate more boost or if it only works with supplemental fueling like port injection or meth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Is anyone running catless without tune/jb4, and would it affect stock engine operation in anyway?\n\nIt shouldn't affect operation in any way, all the tune does it take advantage of the extra flow available (hence free ponies more flow better sound). My Bootmod3 tune added some extra mild burbles, pops and crackle that weren't there when I had jb4(or switch to map0) which are very pleasant when driving (Not Gunshots) and this was the effect of having a Catless Downpipe after 6 months of driving with stock cats.\n\nThanks man! How bad was the fuel smell from inside and on longer journey?\n\nI heard different theories how cat bypass or high flow system impact AFR on stock tune with n55 platform. I am on the \"no change\" side though.\n\nPlay it safe and get ~75% of the gains of a catless by running a safe, clean, CEL free, emissions compliant high flow catted DP like Fabspeed's masterpiece. It's nothing short of amazing.\n\nA catless DP will affect it by time and will also create a bit of turbo lag, smells and probably smoke depending on fuel quality.Most catless DP's will trigger the CEL to go on. The best way to do it is go with a a catted version ( make sure its 200CEL or 100CEL ). With a 200 CEL it won't trigger the CEL 100%. With a 100CEL cat, there might be a 10% chance that it will trigger the CEL unless the seller adds in oxygen sensors made for it. Also, before you buy anything catted, make sure the cats they use are made by HJS.\n\n\n\nThanks everyone for your opinion.I'm building a custom muffler at local shop next week, so I had in mind to ask them to make me a downpipe with CEL fix and run it occasionally. But in general I'm considering Fabspeed decat for quite some time now and definitely will order it in the near future!\n\n\n\nGo for the Fabspeed sport cat DP.

EDIT: Dinan dealer suspects the Stage 1 doesn't produce as much power as the Sport tune because of the additional parameters the advanced Dinantronics module adjusts for safety.  You get Dinantronics for the ability to properly manage Stage 4. Apparently you can switch between Stage 1 and 4 easily with the app for a \"valet\" mode? What say you Dinan?!\n\n\n\n93 octane?\n\n93 octane.\n\nAwesome feedbackDinan_Engineering\n\nThank you OP. Been waiting to see this for long time. Your number looks super legit, or even a little bit lower if 400lb*ft in torque is any indication, which is pretty much stock number on a dynojet we've been seeing. If there is a benchmark number to compare yours to, probably you will do it justice better.From earlier conversation, I know you have a bigger IC installed as well. Please confirm.My setup would be close to yours. Differences are my cat is a slightly more restrictive 300 cell but I have a new turbo inlet pipe which corrects BMW's mistake mating PWG inlet pipe to the EWG turbo compressor wheel inlet which is 20% larger in dia or 44% in cross area (see below pics borrowed). This is not going to make higher boost but more flow at any rpm instead, in other words, turbo will rev less hard at any given boost target and thus pick up a few efficiency it is lacking. Whatever difference that'll make to the peak power though.My build would be much more powerful with a custom Jb4 setting, but I have no interest in maxing out anything. I want power as much out of efficiency as possible, hence all the supporting FBO stuff on the mild Dinan Stage One.I will do a comparison dyno on dynojet involving:1) Stock m2, though not my car unfortunately2) FBO m2 on stock tune (Dinantronics bypass)3) FBO m2 on Dinantronics Stage One4) Stock m4No PI, No meth, No E blend, 93AKI(98RON) only.I'll see how I like my car with those stuff and decide when/if to jump into bigger turbo.\n\nI do have a larger IC. However, stock torque numbers are not even close to 400.\n\nDinan, thanks for the info and insight. Can you comment:1) There is no dip at peak from OP's graph like other m2 piggyback dynos. Reason?2) By peak at 2.5 psi of boost, is it at 5500rpm? I thought it won't make that much boost at the real top end (6000-7000). Correct?3) By peak at 2.5 psi of boost, are you referring to sport tuner or Dinantronics?\n\nDrKevM5have dyno shop email you the DRF Files, i can load it up nicely and graphed for forum viewing pleasure.SeanWRTso BMW put a more restrictive Inlet in the M2? will you be able to dyno before / after to see if this is true ? if it allows more flow then there should be a few more ponies or better curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=SeanWRT;21258000]It's a Pure N55 turbo inlet pipe. Most dont do it because of the questionable gain in power until when installing bigger turbo and of course the labor cost. Though I am the kind of person wanting to spend more to have reliable and consistent and even NOT more power.Have you seen this thread?  Looks like that inlet pipe could make a power difference, along with less stress on the turbo, with a Dinan Stage 4 on an N55 engine.... which makes me wonder why it is not part of Dinan's kit....http://www.n54tech.com/forums/showthread.php?t=42512\n\n[QUOTE=BruceM;21258833]\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=FSociety;21261118]You make a good pointBee Peedid show some gains under the curve on his M135\n\n[QUOTE=kiysersosae;21274139]\n\n[QUOTE=kiysersosae;21274139]\n\n[QUOTE=Bee Pee;21279900]\n\n[QUOTE=kiysersosae;21280006]\n\n\n\n",

They say it's a price to pay for the shortest shifting time.I heard m4 GTS DCT flash is smoother overall.

So in those cases the paddles work better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think the M2 DCT is too smooth. I had a 135is N55 with DCT and that trans was very crisp on its shifts in sport mode. Actually it was very telepathic and I ended up not shifting manually much at all and definitely not on the track. It did a better job than me selecting the right gears at the right time on the track. I was disappointed in the softness of the M2 DCT shifts and it does not do a good job of selecting the right gears. I was offered the first allocation M2 from my dealer last February and it happened to be DCT. I preferred manual but the DCT in my 135is was so good I decided to take it in the M2. I was and am still disappointed at how soft and sluggish it is in comparison. Don't get me wrong. It's still good and in manual mode is pretty good. But it is definitely not as good as the N55 135is was. If you look at the parts they are the same so it's 'just' the software controlling it. I even went to the dealer and asked them to load the 135is software into it. They checked with Germany and were told it was incompatible.\n\n\n\nIt's soft as balls in Comfort. In fact, it's too soft in D.\n\nIn comfort it is meant to be soft as cotton. In fact I was amazed on how smooth it is. I was only referring to SPORT+ shifts.",

    "content": "For those interested, these are my thoughts on these mods:UCP--I should say to begin with that I don't like the stock MT feel in this car.  As I've said in other threads, for me, the pedal stroke is too long and too light, and the shifter throw is too long, too light and not very positive in engagement.  These are onlymythoughts, not anybody else's.  No right answer here.  Still, I know the feel I want and the stock setup did not have it.The UCP (Ultimate Clutch Pedal) shortens the stroke and allows you to select a pedal resistance.  The choices are labeled Comfort (or something like that, I didn't pay attention), Sport and Race.  To be on the safe side, I picked Sport, though I was tempted to pick Race.I still might, but the Sport setting, especially combined with the clutch stop built in to the kit, is much, much better than stock.  Pedal resistance is still not all that strong, but it is clearly stronger than stock, and pretty linear.  I might try Race in a bit here, just to compare.The short shift kit is from UUC.  As far as I am concerned, like the UCP,thisis the way the car should have come from the factory.  Engagement is much more positive.  Throws are maybe 25-30% shorter, and take more effort, but theactof shifting is more pleasurable, tactile. Stick is also lowered somewhat, although I started with the MPerformance carbon fiber inlay stick, which is already a bit lower.  At some point I might replace the boot, pull off the cf knob and go with a bigger UUC knob I got with the SSK kit.All in all, the stock feeling of the shifting process--everything being just too soft and easy and a little vague--is gone, and in its place is a shorter, more compact, more purposeful, \"feel-some\" experience.   Highly recommend this UCP/SSK combination IF you like what I like in a manual tranny.I also lowered with Eibach springs one inch all around, with Turner extended hub spacers, 12mm up front, 10 mm in the rear.This is another mod I recommend highly.  Car feels more connected to the road (I think I actually feel things through the wheel a little bit now!), less roll.  It is NOT a radical change from stock, but it feels right.  One inch still makes most bumps, etc. navigable.  Drop looks good, as others have posted, but not overly slammed.  If you want to avoid any real poke 12/10mm front/rear is about right.  I think it would still look good at 15/12 if you like a little more poke, but I'm happy with 12/10.I also swapped out grills for cf grills from IND, and put on some AA matte black tips, which seem to go well with the cf diffuser.So, for now I'm done (famous last words).  Will wait to install the Fabspeed sport-catted DP--which I have waiting in the basement--with the Dinan kit, when/if it ever shows up.\n\nId like to see some pics of your drop and spacers on the M2\n\nI'm really interested in the clutch pedal as I would like a slightly shorter kick. Hmm tempting.\n\nThanks for the write-up! I agree with everything you mentioned. Definitely post some pics of the new mods when you get the chance\n\nPics pics pics pics!\n\nAll that info but :keep modding brotha ///\n\nOk, I have pics on my phone, but how do you post the damn things?  I can't find the tutorial anywhere...\n\n\n\nIf you are using the Bimmerpost App on your phone you can embed them also by clicking the paper clip on the bottom left..\n\nSorry dudes, can't do it.  Downloaded the Bimmerpost app on my Android, tried to log in with email and password, says it's an \"invalid combination.\" Change password fine, use it to log in on my desktop no problem, but exact same combination of email address and password on phone app and I get the same \"invalid\" message.Anyway, can't really take pics of the UPC or the SSK, and there a plenty of pics of the Eibach/spacer combo around here.  Bummer, though....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the feedback and the link.  12mm front definitely looks to be the way to go from those pics, along with just eyeballing the difference between front & rear on my own setup after lowering.I'm definitely going to try the clutch pedal and I'm guessing that during the short shifter install, the driveshaft will need to be disconnected on the transmission end so it can be moved out of the way.  Might make for a fun Saturday project, or along with an exhaust upgrade if I go that route.\n\nPosting this forBruceMI got the same pic in the two emails, were you trying to send a different shot?\n\nShot to see his spacers setup..\n\nI finally installed my UCP today - install was pretty straightforward except I had to do a lot of cursing to finally get past the backup camera module that prevents the clutch lever from sliding far enough left to come off until I found the way to remove the module.I initially decided to go hardcore & put it on the \"race\" setting.  I drove it around a while, but didn't really like it, at least not on the street.  It was pretty firm for the first half of the short travel, and then just basically fell to the floor for the second half.  There was hardly any travel at all from fully depressed to engagement, which is good, but it just felt weird on the way down.  Maybe it would be better without the springs or with just the small center one.  That might be the way to go for a track car, as there should be better feel all around.I then switched it to \"sport\" mode - the middle position.  Much more to my liking and what I would call the \"goldilocks\" setting from my perspective.  Firmer than stock, but not so biphasic as race mode was with both springs installed.  Shorter travel, quicker engagement & disengagement, and with a lower resting point than stock.  I might try removing the springs and trying race mode again some day, but the sport setting is perfect for now, given that I do a lot of city driving and sometimes get stuck in LA traffic.The stock lever has the clutch pedal resting higher than the brake, but on sport setting, it sits slightly lower.The only issue I ran into (besides some soreness from all the contorting and lost time figuring out how to get the rear camera module out of the way) is with clearance to the under-dash trim panel.   I noticed a \"clack\" noise when the clutch would come to resting position, and after crawling back under, I found that the clutch lever was *just* hitting the trim panel.  It appears to be a manufacturing tolerance thing (lever or trim panel), but it was easily solved by trimming about 1/4\" off the trim panel where the lever was hitting it.\n\n\n\nThanks - yeah race mode might be OK without the springs - they really pull it to the floor once you get about half way down, and it's definitely stiffer for the first half of travel.  I'm content with the sport setting though and plan to leave it there.I also got my Turner Motorsports spacers installed today - 10mm all around and I really like the look.I'm debating the SSK; same goes for Fabspeed downpipe.  If I stop debating and start purchasing, I'll do them both at the same time.\n\n@BruceMwe gotta do a meet up. I wanna checkout your setup in person.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "After debating, searching, and researching this is the simple combo I went with.Anyone who says the is engine is non responsive to tuning obviously has not driven a tuned M2.Now the car needs more rubber without a doubt. In the cold, at 80mph, in 5th she side steps on full throttle. A freaking hoot!$300 for the dinansport (always in race mode) and $1200 for the DP. There is a serious difference in power with this combo, and its very very smooth to boot.\n\nSo whats the deal with the dinan? Where do you plug it in and does it adjust to account for the DP? Is it detectable if removed after use by BMW?would you say the DP alone is sufficient?\n\nIts a one sensor plug in, super easy. Boost, fueling timing are adjusted. Works with the basically maxxed out DME specs.No clue what BMW warranty will do, but my dealer is cool with a removable piggy back, not cracking the ECU for a full tune. IMHO after this combo, im not even looking into that option. No need to.I put the Dinan Sport on before the DP. That in itself was a big difference in the midrange, but you could feel the restriction in the turbo at the top of the rev range. I can say, it hits boost faster, harder, longer with the DP installed. Holds to redline and the midrange went up like 3 levels making it super fun for a street car. Sounds damn good too.\n\n\n\nI can attest to the potency of the sport tuner (at least in race mode with quality 93 octane). For $300, you've basically got a 400 HP M2....sound familiar?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you pushed the car hard, ie: track use yet? Wondering if you might experience overheating/limp mode like others have with the JB+Great little review nonetheless\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you post a link to the tune?\n\nCongrats!!\n\nHow much for the dp install?\n\nHour labor at $90\n\n\n\nShout out to OP, super interested in this.If I go this route, then decide later to add the Dinan big turbo, will I be required to upgrade to the Stage 4 tuner?  Would this simple tuner be less efficient, or obsolete?\n\nDo you know the difference between dinan sports tuner for 300 and the dinan stage 1 performance tuner for 1544?Also, if I were to disconnect the sports tuner every time before going to the dealer would the ECU just reset itself to stock? I'm very interested in this combo. I've been thinking about the Fabspeed sport cat dp for some time.Thanks.\n\nPut about 150 miles on her and it seems to be adapting and getting stronger. Im floored by the difference quite honestly.\n\nHow is car in race mode (+4psi).  Curious as I have BMS Stage 1 on my M235 but might go this route for incoming M2.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Have been slowly buying some parts to modify the M2 ever since I got it in December and will finally get to drive the car tomorrow morning with most of the parts installed. I got a membership last year at the local track country club in Chicago (Autobahn) so this car will mostly be a track car plus driving to and from the track. Here is a list of parts that have been installed. Figured I should start a discussion since there has been a lot of different mod combinations being discussed recently and I should pitch in.- Dinan intercooler- Dinan resonator pipe delete- Fabspeed catted downpipe- Pure Turbo inlet pipe- Evolution Racewerks oil cooler- Evolution Racewerks charge pipes- Eventuri intake- M Performance coilovers- Ground Control camber plates- Dinan rear suspension links- Dinan tension strut ball joint- RKP corner braces- AP Racing front BBK w/ Ferodo DS1.11 pads- Ferodo DS1.11 rear pads- Spiegler steel brake lines- Castrol SRF brake fluidAll the parts have been installed except the brake related parts because I am still waiting for some stuff to arrive. Have setup an appointment early next week with ACF Performance to get the BM3 tune on my DME and then we will do a custom dyno tune for 93 octane. I did not have time to do a base dyno but will post the results after my dyno session on Wednesday. I believe the shop we will be at has a Mustang dynometer.I am planning to stick with the stock wheels for now, but will be moving up to 255/35 and 275/35 sizes like the M3/M4. Right now I am undecided on whether I should go with the Bridgestone RE-71R or Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. I have tracked with Michelin PSS tires before and they seemed fine for a few sessions but I have heard that they don't last very long on the track. Any input on this will be appreciated.I also bought an Awron gauge for the car and will be installing it after I am done tuning the car. I am thinking a roll cage will be next and then maybe bigger turbos. What do you guys think?\n\nSounds like an awesome build! Subscribed! But why are you waiting to install the Awron? It'll give a ton of pertinent info while tuning.\n\nJust how the schedules ended up working out. I think most of the info from the Awron will be available from the BM3 software.\n\nYou'll probably need to upgrade the radiator.\n\nVERY impressive list of parts for what sounds like an awesome little track beast.  No coding yet?  Keep us posted on your favorite mods and bang for buck thoughts.  Congrats!\n\nI took my car to Sebring a couple of times, had a total of ~2 hours of track time. Dude all you need is a pagid brake pads/stainless lines and your set. I did not upgrade anything else and 0 issues for me. My 2nd upgrade will be a bolt in harness, and my 3rd Ohlins. Will see what else I need after that :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably won't get the cage unless I end up storing the car at the track. I was looking at the Schroth harness and didn't see one specifically for the F8X M cars. Will the one for the E90 fit? After the tune, I am not sure if I ever need to go with the bigger turbos. 360 to 380 whp is probably what I am shooting for.Just came back from a 50 mile drive with all the parts minus the brakes and I can say that the steering seems to be more responsive/sensitive, while the turn-in is more crisp. There is definitely more grip through a turn than before. Camber is currently set at -2.8 front and -2.5 rear. The ride is definitely stiffer, but we will need to calibrate that once the track opens in 6 weeks.The turbo sound is really noticeable and I don't think I will be changing the exhaust. The downpipe, resonator delete and stock exhaust sounds pretty aggressive with plenty of pops and crackle. One thing to note about the oil cooler is that the piping that it comes with is slightly too short and causes a lot of rubbing so it maybe a point of failure in the future. It may be perfectly fine but my installer is very anal about stuff like this and recommended that we do some custom piping.The car will be custom BM3 tuned on Wednesday and I should have more impressions by then.\n\n\n\nFor more durable brake performance, you should think about brake cooling.I think, that this here is the best product:http://www.lightweight-titanauspuffa...mw-m2-f87.html\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks! Do you have pictures of the installed product? Also, have you seen in the installation manual? I am wondering how much labor is involved with this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A couple of months ago I got rid of ASD via the bypass harness. I am running stock exhaust. I've only driven 20 miles or so on the new downpipe but wow - what a marked, positive difference. My first impression/feeling was that with the sportcat installed, ASD appeared to be back, and back in a good way. Obviously its not back as the harness is doing its thing (sending a no input signal to the amp) but the sportcat puts the sound back in the cabin - au natural!!Sounds noticeably more raspy with more energy to the pops and burbles, you can also really hear and feel the turbo working more efficiently, it comes \"on\" sooner and the car feels more eager to go go go! (I guess because of the reduction of back pressure - allowing the gasses to escape quicker - and the design of the DP itself as the cat is located closer to the turbos than oem design). Sound from the stock exhaust when you hit 4,500 plus rpm is intoxicating. 20 miles in and very impressed. Lets hope no CEL in the future!!Will likely go for MPE once the redesigned version is out - I love the Remus, especially how the mufflers are well hidden up inside the car, but MPE is cheaper and retaining warranty is a nice touch - plus MPE is made by Akrapa (or so I'm led to believe) so neither is a bad option!\n\nNop, akrapa designed some past models but not for M2.\n\nMPE is made byRed Arch\n\nREMUS\n\n\n\nIn Germany, we have the Problem, that the MPE is not available any longer due to noise regulations. So the Remus system is an interesting alternative. The Akra obviously not comparable because of the much higher price.By the way: hello to everyone! This is my first real post here 😊\n\nI absolutely loved the REMUS when I saw it at Autosport International. I have not heard it but it looks superb. Great kit for the price tag.MR\n\nI think that Remus has made a great development during the last years. Coming from a low price/ low quality brand to very well manufactured products.",

A basic dynojet google search will show an average drivetrain loss of 15%.  This would equate to 310hp.I understand there is no references form this particular dyno but 310 doesn't seem unreasonable from some crude calculations.\n\nSo 340whp is spot on too! Great!

Comparing XI models because that's all i could find for the X4 M40i(which apparently has the same motor as the M2)I wouldn't call this official but maybe the M2 has a different turbo than a standard N55 motor? Tuners start to get excited?\n\nThere is a thread around here somewhere showing a different part number from both the M235i and X4 turbos.\n\nFrom herehttps://www.parts.bmwgroup.com/webetk/FzgIdCtrlM2 turbo/exhaust manifold part number is 11658053153.M2 cylinder head part number is common to other N55 engines hinting at above being compatible with non M2 N55 engines\n\nIn the F87 Technical Training manual that was uploaded here a couple of months ago there is no mention of a new turbo.  Yet the manual goes in to minute detail on everything else that has changed from the M235i (and N55 used in the M235i).  For example, what has changed in the piston rings, adjustments to the oil supply and addition of a second oil suction pump.The only mention of turbo changes in the manual concern the overboost function and that a blow off valve without diaphragm from the N20 is used.Given the information in the manual I'd be very surprised if they omitted to mention a completely new turbo!\n\n\n\nhttp://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1226283\n\nSo can we not expect to be able to swap n55 turbo with M2 turbo?\n\nRemember that M4 owner going on about how it uses the same turbo as the M235i and that it's potential is way less, and that's the **main** reason that the M4 is worth it? It got like 30 likes. I said it wasn't confirmed but no one listened.karma",

This is what I have so far on the car and what is comingCurrent:Intake EventuriDP AKRAExhaust AKRAOrdered:Wagner Evo 2 Comp ICFTP Charge pipesPure Inlet version 2DV+I am going to install these and do a tune. My question is do I go the Bootmod route, or DINAN electronics? I will only run 93 octane I am in NY and NJ.

Hopefully with the mods coming and a tune I can be held over for a little. Also have KW3 coming. Happy Days\n\nIf you go Pure then the only route to go is bootmod3 or jb4 or similar. Dinantronics is only good for Dinan upgrades as that is what it's tuned for. Unless you wanted to try and unlock Dinan's software and try to play with it, which I haven't heard of anyone doing.

Dinan fueling is a LPFP replacement that addresses potential inconsistency issue, not the correct type of improvement you need. Sure you can always run lean and detune a little bit, but running on the edge of fueling or anything isn't a good idea in long term.This is what's going to happen: add port injection to your list and that calls for BM3 jb4 stack. Meth is also on its way and you'll be recommended to use E blend to make impressive numbers for bragging rights.

But I want to get peoples' input on what they think is the best or most accurate mathematical equation. I hear the \"how much horsepower\" question seemingly on a daily basis since I've bought my car. Most of these people couldn't differentiate an LSD from a DCT so I want to make it easy for both of us and provide a universal answer, especially since my power numbers are incrementally increasing over time.My thoughts are as follows based upon this popular position relative to the M2:A 6MT car assumes a 12% drivetrain loss and a DCT assumes a 15% loss. Therefore, if the typical stock M2 puts down 335 WHP, a 6MT unit should advertise 380 HP (335/.88) and a DCT unit should advertise 394 HP (335/.85). These numbers do seem high. I'd appreciate what everyone has to say. Feel free to rip apart my hypothesis if you have better sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally hate the whole drivetrain loss measured in %....Yes a 400hp dct rwd car may lose a certain amount of hp that equates to 15% bt that doesnt mean when that car is modified to 800hp (crank)that it loses twice as much power to the wheels...For example an unmodded car (x) looses 30hp to spin the drive train...You modify it and double the hp.  Is it magically twice as hard to push? No...zMaybe there are stronger drive train components, or in gear maybe the compression ratio makes it harder to push but from my experiences drive train loss is ridiculous to measure in percentages.Different cars are more effiecient than others st putting the power down, but it shouldnt be measured in %, Hope this makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow accurate is the horsepower calculator on the dragtimes site?12.0 ET116 trap3600 lbsequals 425 flywheel\n\nWhere's the 3% extra loss coming from with the DCT?

I'm planning on driving mine for a while before any upgrades, but the  downpipes make more sense\n\nIf you're planning on keeping ASD active with no bypass harness/coding I'd stick with the stock setup\n\nI have the MPE installed on my car, I don't regret ordering it and absolutely love it, makes the car that much more fun to drive. Track mode is intoxicating!!Plus those cf tip coke can tailpipes makes the back end pop.\n\nStock is good, but an aftermarket exhaust  sounds better. The MPE is just expensive. I put the Dinan exhaust with the resonator delete on mine and it sounds insane while also costing probably 2k less. The Fabspeed sounds great too if you're good with loud mode 100% of the time. Depends on how much you like your neighbors\n\nI bought it and wasn't sure at the time.  For me it is the single best option to get on the car.  I drive probably 98% in Sport + and probably for the exhaust, 70% in Track mode.The exhaust alone made me love and actually look forward to stop and go traffic.  Initially when I got MT instead of DCT, I was worried about DDing the car.  Now, I can't believe how much the exhaust has added to the experience for me.\n\n\n\nUnless you want some kind of performance upgrade and a lighter exhaust system, then no the stock sounds better in my opinion, okay granted not as loud but still better. my advice is to get the Akrapovic System, its expensive but you save weight and gain power and torque.\n\nReading all your comments the common theme seems to be that the MPE is too expensive, maybe they are priced differently in other parts of the world but in Canada it is a 3500CAD option. If you compare that to some of the other options, it costs almost the same as Dinan (after conversion) and half the price of Akropovic (even though that system looks amazing) about 1500 - 2000 more than the fabspeed, but as a couple of you have pointed out, that system is loud 100% of the time.I do believe that there is something to be said for installing a factory system over an aftermarket. I shouldn't make re-sale my deciding factor, but there will be few M2's out and about with MPE and to some that's important. I also think that the Carbon exhaust tips will look cool with the Black Sapphire LOLThe decision for me is really between MPE and stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Was looking at the performance difference between all the sports cats with 300 cel HJS internals and Fabspeed aside, performance increase is only reported as 9 - 12bhp by Akraprovic and  Miltek. There is obviously an improvement on sound and people report throttle response improvement.What I'm asking is at £1200 is it worth it?And, if I went with no cat (downpipes for £300) would a tune be needed? Not fussed about the check light as I can reset this. I did run no tune and no cats on the 1M and never had an issue. When I had it on the dyno the afr was absolutely fine.\n\nTune is not needed for either one but you get max performance when you add a tune with the downpipe.If you have a JB4, it will hide the code so you can go catless or regular catted (not HJS).If you have a tune that does not hide the code (JB stage 1, Active 8, Dinan,etc...) HJS are worth it because you will not get a code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's all about balance of the gain and sacrifice.A catless system that give you 100% flow and CEL and a smelly car.You have the option with HJS 200 cell to flow 10% less so you're CEL free and have much less smell to live with.One step further, a HJS 300 cell (EU6) comes with smog test guarantee and smells the same as stock, with 10% less flow over 200 cell.Now you think about how 10% flow affect performance. That will have everything to do with your mods. But there's definitely diminishing return in play, meaning going from stock to 300 cell probably get you 80~90% of the gains (dependent of the peak flow demand from you mods) of a cat bypass system. If you can handle CEL, don't care emission and are fine with smell, pursue the remaining gains with catless dp.Personally never been able to live with smell. To me 200/300 cell sit nicely in between restrictive stock and cat bypass.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny one have comparisons to the ER catted downpipe?http://evolutionracewerks.com/node/269\n\nSo the factory cat is 400cel....so, is a 100 cel reduction worth it, I'm not sure now.  I think going with the richter 200cel for UK guys would be the best option, especially if you have the function to clear cel codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Sport Cat Downpipe is 100% the best route to go. It is a simple bolt-on and go have fun modification and being CEL free. I definitely do not recommend running a catless downpipe without a tune. There are a whole host of issues that could arise from that. Just because you didn't have issues in the past, doesn't mean the car was running healthy.Check your PMs - I'd love to chat more about getting you set up!Also our dyno results are from a direct comparison of the stock M2 then Sport Cat Downpipe installed. Both tested in the same day and under the same conditions and with awesome results!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, after some good chats  with Fabspeed I've decided to purchase their downpipe (200 cel). I think the deciding factor was the amount of people on here that comment on there service and the fact it's a 200 cel with hjs,i shouldn't forget how easy they have been to deal with.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "It's happened twice now. I start my M2, in the underground parking lot where I keep it, and it trips the car alarm of another vehicle.I should hasten to add that, when I start my M2, I don't rev it much at all. Also, my 2015 X3, parked right next to my M2, has never caused this phenomenon during hundreds of starts. To be fair, though, the M2 is much \"boomier\" when first started.The first time it happened, about a week ago, the other vehicle was pretty far away, maybe 10 spaces down. It was a sedan, but I'm not sure what make/model.Today, when it happened, the other vehicle (a Porsche Cayenne) was 3 slots away. I felt a little guilty driving off with the Cayenne angrily honking its horn and flashing all its lights.Has this happened to anyone else? -scrEdited to add: I'm running the stock exhaust system.\n\nhaha, that's kind of awesome\n\nThe stock exhaust sounds rather loud when starting the car (even in comfort)... I don't necessary like the attention it creates. But is some sort of sportscar so it is forgiven.\n\nYup.  I think it's fun.  (I have the MPE, and even with the valves closed it sets alarms off, but even more so with them open)\n\nBadge of honor.\n\nHappened to me even in my M235i. But usually only in garages. Some car's alarms are too sensitive. Their prob.\n\nYeah this is almost a twice a week problem for me and I feel so bad for my neighbors I actually apologized to most of them already whenever I end up catching them pulling in or out at the some time I am lol. Thank goddd they're all really cool and don't mind it at all. I never set their alarms off cause it's outdoor usually but I set alarms off constantly on side streets especially narrow side streets.I have the MPE + VRSF Catless DP + Eventuri Intake + VRSF Chargepipe (some other goodies soon); but this combo is easily one of the loudest exhausts I've heard and I get stopped and talked too all the time because of the sound. Idk what it is about that specific combo of mods but with the valves open and the car in Sport, Sport +, or traction (burble mode) it easily sets of any car alarm if I push on it. I don't ever purposely do it.......but uhhh it's an M2. I bought it over the M4 I had put my deposit on because I test drove it and it was just FUN. So I drive - Fun. That causes alarms to go off. Whoops. lol anyways yeah it's a loud exhaust even in stock form. I was pleasantly surprised by that.\n\nI'm failing to the see the problem here.\n\n\n\nYou tried parking in the opposite direction?\n\nIf it were setting off all of the alarms I would say its an issue with how loud the M2 is but I don't think thats the issue. Some car alarms are set so sensitive that they are going off from simple proximity or mild vibrations so that is really their issue not yours.  You have a stock car and are not doing anything wrong.\n\nThe other car just got excited!  Like a Puppy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would cause me to giggle every morning if that happened. I almost want to park next Cayennes now to test hahaLike you say, if I was the Cayenne owner I probably wouldn't be happy at having to leap out of shower to turn the alarm off every morning. Maybe they can do it through the app on their phone, I'd feel less bad in that case.\n\n\n\n\n\na co-worker's truck has an aftermarket alarm what comes with a vibration sensor (i think that's what it is).  she parks next to me and my m2 would set off her alarm nearly every time i start the car.  i joke that her truck is scared of my little sports car.\n\nWith MPE, cold start nor valves closed driving has set off any car alarms so far - it's only been 3 days of ownership.  I would say it's more on the car alarms that are sensitive.\n\nYeah, it happened once at work (underground parking spot)Set off the alarm on a Volvo V70 parked 6-7 cars away from my spot. Was a bit embarrassing tbhHowever that is the onnly time and only car that it has set off the alarm for. My collegues cars parked right next to me, BMW 5-series and Audi Q5 are completely unaffected so I suppose some cars are more sensitive than others\n\nHahah any idea what happens when you fit an aftermarket exhaust?I do it even more now....

Everyone who recently bought the pkg generally has to wait 3 weeks for the turbo to arrive\n\n\n\nWell I got it, but only the DINANTRONICS Performance Tuner Stage 1, Not the Signature or the complete Power Package.I can tell you there is clearly a difference on how the car reacts, the throttle response is much sharp even if you are in comfort mode the car wants to fly, and you could actually feel those extra HP :P, but I have to yet dyno the car to see much better.By using the onboard computer, the sport display Power & Torque Gauge says it's hitting the 380HP mark, as well as a much higher torque. and If I turn off the S1 via phone app, it goes down around 25HP.I got it as soon as I got my baby, but finally im able to play with it haha. That only makes me wonder how good that S4 would be on it.\n\nWhat octane gas? Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've had the Stage 1 tune since September, in anticipation of later upgrading to Stage 2 once the turbo package came out.  I originally had the JB+, but was having issues with the car going into limp mode after approx. 20min. of hard track usage.  I theorized that the JB+ lacked the more comprehensive control of parameters needed for extended aggressive use.  Haven't had any problems with the Stage 1 on the track, and in comparison to the JB+, the power delivery was much smoother.  Planning on upgrading to the turbo/Stage 2 in the spring.\n\nI was considering it but when I look at the graphs it looks like the Dinan tune follows the BMW tune except for two small blips in the HP and TRQ which only last for a few RPM before following the BMW curve again.So is it really worth it? What am I missing?\n\n\n\n\n\nHope someone with the Stage1 can go to a Dynojet do 2-3 pulls on the tune and last pull with the tune disabled via bluetooth app to see their baseline + delta gains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhat curious to know why Dinan, CA based, is testing at 93oct vs 91oct. My guess is it numbers based and I would really like to see number on 91. I personally am going to go suspension and brakes (KW/Brembo) before i go power, but am still curious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hi guys. Just a quick question about M2 exhaust sound/volume. I am trying to decide if I want an exhaust system or bypass. I don't mind kinda loud, but don't want piss off the neighbors loud. I had an E60 M5 with no mufflers and an STi with an exhaust. The M5 wasn't too bad, but the STi was too loud. I have a 235i now with BMW sport exhaust that is too mild. Does anyone have a frame of reference for me?Take delivery in February. So I have a little timeThanks\n\n\n\n\n\nWith MPE and flaps open, it's still a lot quieter than the STi I had with catless Downpipe and Borla XR-1. The STi would could hear down the street. The M2 you can only hear pulling into the block. With flaps closed, you can barely hear it a couple of houses away.That having been said, stock will be even quieter.\n\nI have MPE + Catless DP's + Eventuri Intake and with flaps open and in sport or sport plus it's actually ridiculously loud. Almost to the point of me wanting to put back the catted downpipe on. Thank Goddddddd for the valve control button. I keep it closed most of the time. I open it up once or twice a day and it sounds like a race car and makes me smile then I close it so I don't get complaints in my neighborhood (may be too late already lol)\n\nStock it sounds nice but I still want it louder. My Bypass arrived yesterday and wil be installed Friday, will try to get some comparo vids but online videos are difficult to properly capture the true sound.\n\nThanks for the replies. I'll take all the help I can\n\n\n\n\n\nCould you please give the dimensions of that box ? My daughter is going to be in New York for a few months and I'm wondering if she could fit that exhaust in her suitcase when she comes home.... so avoiding shipment costs and import duty.\n\n\n\nDK IF u interested but i use a 3\" DP  with a 3\" exhaust cutout. Used to have an electronic flap by Quicktime peformance...now im running a 3\" loud valve. Its a boost activated cutoff that runs open dp stating at 2 psi...for the loud valve you will have to create a boost source tho...Luckily bc valvetonic you have full boost b4 u thottle body at wot...\n\nOP, I would wait till you get the car and see if you like the stock exhaust before you plan mods.  In my opinion it is a very nicely balanced.  Sporty and gets plenty of attention while being very livable day to day.\n\nYou will be pleasantly surprised at how loud the stock system is. By no means is it a screamer but it sounds very good. If money was no object I'd get the active Autowerke system as that is in my opinion the best sounding M2 exhaust I've heard to date. That or Dinan which is second up to me.\n\nSound is such a subjective thing. I've heard the MPE described as 'quite loud' but to me in reg. sport mode it sounds great and balanced. on cold start its loud but once it warms up and regular driving its quiet to my ears and I only hear it when I step on it. Track mode on the other hand is pure symphony and sounds amazing. Some though would find it obnoxious and not like it.So basically what I'm saying is listen for yourself as everyone hears things differently.\n\nIf you go catless on the M2, do you need a tune because it changes the characteristics of the car? Or because you need to clear the CEL?I see that there are CEL fixes to go along with the catless downpipes, I'm assuming they aren't using a tuning solution? Is it safe to drive the car catless without a tune? I come from the WRX/STI world, and it's must to have a tune whether it's catted or catless.Thanks!",

    "content": "The arrival of INDs M2 last week created a flurry of activity: wheel fitment needs to be measured, suspension checked, installation instructions written, and baseline testing must be conducted. The excitement around the car was absolutely palpable at IND, as we admired what looks in many ways like BMWs homage to the glory days of M. Here we could see that BMW had done everything possible to create a car that followed core M principles: the M2 is simple, lightweight, and dynamic.Any time a new M car arrives at IND, the staff can find itself feeling like were doing many things all at once. However, one item on our to-do list remains unchanged, and at this point is effectively an IND tradition: a dyno test at the venerable AMS Performance.AMS DynoJet dyno has been host to every single M car IND has ever used for Research & Development, since our E92 M3 many years ago. Hearing the M2 roar to life on the same dyno thats contained our F10 M5, F82 M4, and so many other cars felt like the perfect way to begin our journey with the M2.Although these preliminary dyno tests do not yield all possible information, they are able to give us some basic early impressions about the M2. By testing the car over the course of several runs, we can get an early feel for heat soak, the shape of the poweband, and how the ECU manages boost and ignition timing as repeated runs and elevated temperatures are introduced. While we will not be publishing specific information at this time, we did want to share the initial power output of the M2: a stout335 horsepower and 370lbs-ft of torqueat the rear wheels.Enjoy the photos, and stay tuned as we dive deeper into BMWs M2!\n\nNice !Looking forward to your follow ups as time goes by with this car and what can/can't be achieved.Perhaps at sometime in the future you may be able to tells us about the turbo and what the situation with the block is\n\nLooking forward to more\n\nIlia@INDbringing this thread back from the dead. What octane was this on? and is your M2 DCT or manual? If possible can you post the dyno chart? I am looking for a 93oct \"baseline\" dyno on a dynojet for the M2 DCT. Searched Dynojet and this thread popped up\n\nThey are based in the Chicago area so I am assuming it is 93 octane. Saw their car yesterday and it is DCT.\n\n\n\nPost says \"335 horsepower and 370lbs-ft of torque\". Other dynojet runs of stock M2s consistently show pretty much the same.\n\nOnly wish AMS step into game and make Alpha 4/5/6 pkg for BMW.\n\n\n\n",

Is Map 7 the way to go when running Meth Nos combo on about 16-17psi?If not, how could I retard ignition  timing on a non permanent basis? So I can still make decent power while driving on a reg basis?And while Im at it, question to experienced N55/n54 tuners who have utilized NO2, do the stock coil packs pack enough punch to spark through a mix of cold dense air, 115 octane fuel with an AFR on the richer side, and I'm sure a very high CR?I know many would be worried about knock but I think i went overkill on the opposite side, obviously I would rather misfire than have an even minor detonation...Any EXPERT advice, other than non-engineer \"Magazine mechanics\" typical \"n02 will blow your motor\" would be extremely appreciated...However, if you are an expert tech that has a deep understanding of this engine, N02s effect, and my specific setup and see any thing other than the generic response obviously I am not dumb enough to ignore it...Hopefully some more experiended members can throw in their $.02Thanks\n\nNo one?115 AKI, lower boost, N02 inactive at higher RPM, and extremely low IATs , will there even be a need to retard timing?

I would suggest you get a respected tuning shop near you involved.Or just turn everything up to 11.\n\n\n\nA JB4 has no timing control, and relies on the DME's adaptive advance.For a big turbo, nitrous, etc. you can look into adding the CPS module (if you can find one...it it even F series compatible), or...a better idea, just get a back-end flash.But the JB4...no timing control.Terry, back in the day...Quote:Like I said via email we've not done any nitrous development for a long time and don't plan to do anything beyond what is already there. My advice is to write a flash map intended for nitrous use and load that map when running nitrous or planning to run nitrous. Using the JB4 nitrous activations to trigger it. I'd keep the shot below a .28 jet and run at least 1500ml/min of meth with it. I'm also not a CPS fan and don't plan to spend any additional time on it's development. I know Shiv is in to it so you may find some luck with him offering something more dynamic if he still offers any nitrous support.Where I do plan to spend development time in the future is on having the JB4 able to directly reflash the DME directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething to consider...the M2 makes more power with better quality of fuel, this is almost 100% the result of timing advance. So JB4 with its Flex fuel connector tricks the DME into thinking ( true or not) theres better and or more fuel, therefor influencing timing...I think theres no doubt it has an INDIRECT effect, which really doesnt help me...But...Illupload the Ignition Timing Chapter in 20 mins and PM it to you guys  so the debate can be squashed.\n\nThe bottom line is, is JB4 Map 7 Race Gas Map the map to run with a small shot of Nitrous, a load of Meth, and relatively low boost (16PSI)?....IAT's bc of the C02 / Water sprayer, Meth, will most likely be lower than ambient temps...\n\n\n\n\n\n",

PTF will use the bootmod3 device platform for tuning similar to how we use MHD and the Cobb AP on the N54 and E series N55. All tuners will have access to the same released table definitions exposed by the bootmod3 contributing team including any enthusiast community contributors.7) Provide end-users with ability to perform all/any of these features without visiting a dealer or tuner location - do it in your driveway or while at the track8) Allow for real-time monitoring/live dash of any loggable data channels9) Exhaust flap control from within the app10) Diagnostic Code Read and Clear, Adaptations (ECU) reset11) Provide re-sale value in the flasher device - Currently non-existent with any of today's bench flashes and only possible with piggybacks. What this means for end-user is when ready to move on to a different car/platform the device can be uninstalled from the car and sold/reused by the next customer recouping a portion of their investment12) Android and iOS apps - We didn't want a laptop being a necessity in the car to use the device. Full control/logic over all features will be provided through Android and iOS bootmod3 apps. Apps will be a free to download and all feature updates will be delivered via the iOS and Android app stores.13) Apps and the device communicate over Wifi, similar to how the GoPro mobile app works with a GoPro camera for instance. No wiring in between the flasher hardware and the phone/tablet.14) Flash back to stock performance map or OEM factory/original software allowing for putting the LOCK back on if requiredFAQ:What is bootmod3?bootmod3 is the first custom tuning platform for the BMW F series vehicles.What do I need from you to get this going?1) License purchased on our website, click here. License currently includes all the features including flashing DME, DCT TCU, logging, live dash, read/clear codes, reset adaptations, reset ECU and others.2) bootmod3 mobile app - currently available for Android in the Google Play store, click here. iOS app is just around the corner along with a Web-only version.3) BMW ENET (OBD) cable - available on Amazon, one of them available here:https://www.amazon.com/BMW-ENET-Ethe...rds=enet+cable4) bootmod3 OBD Agent software - free download from dropbox to run on your laptop. Setup instructions provided, click here. Agent software connects your vehicle's OBD port to bootmod3 servers and the device is not VIN locked.Optional: bootmod3 Agent hardware device - Convenience always-on option, alternative to #4 above. Why? Removes the need to use a laptop in the car and comes preconfigured with the agent software for connectivity to bootmod3 servers. Alternatively also, there are some neat smaller footprint windows tablets.Can I use bootmod3 with more than one car?bootmod3 license applies to 1 VIN. OBD Agent hardware device however can be used on multiple cars.Can I just buy the flasher or just the logger as I don't care for other features?We strongly believe a tuning platform should have all of the features provided and we are adding more all the time without additional licensing fees. In case of higher demand for portions of bootmod3 features such as offering flash-only or logging-only licenses, we do have the means to seaperate them out. Please inquire separately at this time.Do I need to unlock my DME?Yes. One time DME unlock is required to gain OBD access.Who can unlock it for me?We can take care of the DME unlock at our home location listed on our website or through any of the authorized unlocker dealer locations listed here in alphabetical order below. NOTE: Prior appointment scheduling is required. Cost of unlock and DME labor for removal/reinstall is to be inquired with the shop you're interested in getting the unlock done with.DME is unlocked, got the car back, I have the license activation key and original 4MB factory file from the car, mobile app is downloaded and installed, what's next?Log in and follow the prompts to configure your vehicle in the app. It should be fairly straightforward but if any questions at all drop us a line.How do I get a tune to flash on my car?bootmod3 comes with one OTS tune/map for your car's modifications and octane from us. Additional OTS maps if needed can be provided as a separate item, pricing indicated on our website.Any dyno numbers?More dynos to follow with additional modifications and octane.Can I run E85 or meth and do you have OTS maps for these?Yes, they're currently in beta and we'd love to have you on board with us going through testing.Do you offer backend flashes to run with a JB4?Yes. In fact our OTS Stage 1 and Stage 2 maps are great backend flashes as they raise load and torque targets far higher than stock allowing the DME and TCU to run as close to actual values as possible.How do I datalog?Using the bootmod3 mobile app and agent running in the car while connected to the bootmod3 servers (cloud).Can I use my JB4 mobile app with your flash and log with JB Mobile?Yes, absolutely.Do I need to always have a laptop with me in the car to run the agent? Do I need the device always plugged in?No. Agent that runs on a laptop or hardware device is only required to be used if using the bootmod3 app features. Otherwise, no need for anything to be plugged into the OBDII port.What's the difference between bootmod3 and JB4?bootmod3 reprograms the vehicle's factory engine control unit (DME). JB4 is a piggyback device that works in tandem with the DME to offer additional features.Can I tune my own car with bootmod3?Custom tuning for the end user is coming out soon. TunerPro XDF files will be provided for the initial release for anyone looking to spend time and dive into it on their own or with a tuner of their choice without additional cost.Will this void my warranty?As with any aftermarket hardware modification on the car or any tuning, there is a chance the dealer may refuse or void the drivetrain portion of your warranty.

Is it better to let the car break in or does it not matter as long as you follow break in protocol?Also are BMW likely to note down the sport cat at the breakin period? And any implications to warranty after this?Thanks\n\n\n\n\n\nMy experience, here in the UK, the dealer does not care what mods you've done until you come to make a warranty claim.We're protected by law to stop them from using mods as a reason not to honour a claim for unrelated items. I.e. If I go in for a problem with the brakes they can't not honour the warrant because you have a window tint.Fit a de-cat and remap and go in with engine issues and it would probably go the other way.If you're only fitting a cat back exhaust it has zero impact to performance, it purely a cosmetic thing so I'd argue it's impossible to cause issues elsewhere....\n\nBreak in period is when mechanical parts, mostly moving/rotating assemblies, physically \"adapt\" themselves to each other. It has little to nothing to do with exhaust system because they are just directing gas flows.If you're modding your engine/transmission, you better do it as early as possible if anything - or you will have break them in again like you do with a new car.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should have no issues with installing an aftermarket system during the break-in period.\n\nYou only go for a break in service to get a once over on all the chassis bolts and exhaust bolts but most important of the lot,  to get rid of the break in oil (usually mineral oil), check for any  issues with metal shavings (blatent metal shavings) and get the synthetic oil in.",

    "content": "Well I'm looking to get some views on the 2 tuning options from Stienbauer and AC.Both use,  from what I can tell,  pulse duration modifiers piggybacking the stock ECU, they are claiming 60bhp increase with no DP or intercooler.AC is expensive at around £2500 but has a warranty of 2 yearsStienbauer is cheaper at around £1200 and only warranty the unitI used the Stienbauer in the past on a mini jcw and it was fantastic, dynoed at 250whp -  with excellent afr- and was switchable on/off,  and With it off it showed 218bhp on the Dyno,  so it works Just wonder about the m2 and the ability to take a n extra  60bhpI also like the fact you could remove and dealer wouldn't be able to tell it was installed.Any thoughts welcome\n\nCheck out the Jb+ and JB4 threads. [Depending on the fuel] it seems most are skeptical of those kind of gains\n\nMaybe 30bhp max with piggy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the guys at stienbauer are going to send me the box and if it's not producing the quoted power on my stock m2 will give me my cash back.I should have it by next week so fingers crossed.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've decided I'm not going to do it,  I'm to nervous and I couldn't get any hard data from stienbauer. Sorry guys\n\nOK... I've bought the stienbauer unit so Il install it this weekend  and get it on the dyno next week to see what the results are. I'm hoping 30-40bhp\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalled the stienbauer unit today and wow!!  What a difference,  especially up at 4000rpm and above.  I done some pulls but the road condition were a bit greasy.  A/F looked fine,  timing was OK and iat was about 10c higher.  Overall,  it's impressive. I've got dyno booked 2 weeks today so we will see what hp gains we get. On the road though,  it felt really strong, I'm guessing 30/40hp\n\nWhat kind of gas? 93 octane equivalent?\n\n\n\nWell it's disappointing.. A 10bhp increase with the piggyback.  Stock runs were 388hp but the delta was 10bhp between stock and tuning box, that's the important bit. I guess we just verified that the piggyback tuning is not the way to go with this car/engine.Also,  iat were up at a max 80deg Celsius on a  full power run, we let it cool to 28 degrees C in between runs. The timing was being pulled above 5000rpm both stock and piggy due to high iat Temps. Afr was at its lowest 10.9. I was using shell v power 99ron.I wouldn't say the intercooler is poor,  when I'm going hard on the open road I never see temperatures like that.So the story goes,  if your tuning an m2, get a flash. Unless of course, you can get a piggy custom set up on your car, might make a difference.I'm also sure the ac shnitzer system is made by steinbauer.\n\nso u got a 10 whp gain?And the advertised gains were 50 bhp?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso then the natural question - are you going to go for an upgraded intercooler?",

    "content": "Before I pull the plug, do I really need to upgrade the intercooler on  my M2? I'm currently running about 400bhp and 435ft/lbs torque. Only real mod outwith the piggy back is the mpe.On the dyno I was seeing Temps of 75 deg c between runs,  recovery was quite quick but obviously real world is different and those temperatures will be different (less) .  It's too cold and wet to get any good results regarding heat soak etc. now.I live in the UK so Temps are never that high,  average summer is about 16 deg c.Don't want to upgrade if I don't need too but would welcome some input on this.\n\nI heard from Dinan that a IC does have gains though minimal, at above 5K.More importantly, cooler IAT helps hit target load easier, makes more consistent and reliable power.The only concern would be turbo lag introduction from a bigger IC. Tune/piggyback can make a sharper throttle response to make that lag less noticeable. But the fact the air has to fill up a bigger room before entering cylinders is a hard fact.I myself am on the fence on IC route, especially when not ready for big build.\n\n\n\nWhat piggyback are you running?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would upgrade the intercooler, something like Wagner EVO 1 should be enough\n\nThing is, unless you are racing the thing, it doesn't really matter... On the street, your full throttle time is what, .01% of the run time? If you log it you'll be amazed how little you have it pegged which is the only time that the IC is going to matter. Its probably the last thing I'd upgrade unless it just makes you feel good. I put on a big EVO raceworks on my Audi when I strapped a big turbo on it (doubling the HP), but for the minimal gains the M2 gets via chip it hardly seems worth it. I added almost 100hp to my Bug without an IC upgrade, and it still pulls hard over in 100+ degrees in the Dallas heat all day long (street driving of course). Does it help? yes. Is it worth doing with just chip/dp for street driving at such minimal power increases? up to you, but probably not for most people. I'd only do it with a turbo upgrade myself, but YMMV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hey guys,Picking up the car tomorrow and already have most of my mods planned but having a hard time determining which exhaust I'll be dumping my money to. So far I only know of dinan, akra, mpe, fabspeed, and Remus exhaust. Was hoping to hear some opinions about what people find the best. Right now I'm leaning towards either Akra (dish out the cash and enjoy) or the Dinan exhaust (save money)\n\nI have the Dinan with the resonator delete currently and love the sound. Unfortunately, I don't have much else to compare with other than what I've heard online. Certainly can't beat the price differential though between the Dinan and Akra, but I don't imagine you will be disappointed regardless of which you choose. The car just sounds really good. Another one to take a look at is the Milltek ()although I'm not sure if it has the valve control which is why I ruled out the Fabspeed.\n\n\n\nI'm going with the Dinan with res delete. It sounds raw and nasty and compliments the M2's personality in that regard. Not to mention it's relatively inexpensive.\n\n\n\nI am also getting the Dinan with res delete. I hear it sounds wickeeed!\n\nI like my MPE\n\n\n\nI think the FI exhaust is the best sounding one available. It's also available as a full turbo back system so it can provide some power gains\n\nMy opinion, no reason to upgrade stock exhaust since it's basically zero HP gains. Just roll with the stock exhaust for awhile, see if you like it which does sound awesome! And if you do like it, just swap out the tips, cheap upgrade\n\nI've heard the PE and Dinan exhaust and well I went Dinan\n\nI also went with Dinan with resonator delete, very pleased with the sound and price point.\n\n\n\nIm running an FI Exhaust with/ DP. The car sounds like a diesel truck, and the pops and bangs are now shotguns and rifles. Much much deeper note, though deeper note imo made it quieter in the cabin then stock exhaust w/ catless DP. Also having a valved system is a much as the FI is loud as hell.\n\nI have a feeling that the meisterschaft one that's released is probably going to be one of the best sounding exhausts. If it improves sound anything like it did on the e92 M3 it'll insane. I know it was a V8 NA and all that but with this beautiful of a sound already coming stock I think they will be able to really perfect it. They usually go super hard core though so it's not going to be for someone that wants no drone or low drone at low rpms. I was going to pull the trigger on the MPE yesterday at 3500 including carbon fiber tips I guess that was the best price my SA could get me he said. But decided to wait to hear the meisterschaft because of how inanse the other ones they make sound. Hope it lives up to my expectations. If anyone has any idea of release or sound clip please let me know!\n\nMy vote goes to REMUS\n\n\n\nEisenmann is being released any day now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI went with MPE and love the sound. It also looks good. Went with the titanium tips to break up the carbon fiber diffuser.",

My thirst for knowledge, love of reading, and over 12 years experience as an ASE  certified A tech (by 18) moving up  to the manager of a newer high performance sport compact shop in Free port (Area 220 aka Second to none)....This hands on experience, ability to read and learn what I didn't know combined with a physics major / engineering minor let me take my tuning abilities to a new level...Not only could I tune from a blank slate (usually better and faster than the competition) But my tunes were known to be safer and better for engine longevity as well...Understanding basic physics allowed me to know not just what do do, but why, and sometimes even how, finding new creative ways to get the same results with easier methods and/or higher degrees of safety....Enough tooting my own horn, simply looking to give you some back ground on myself, and leave it to the reader if he wants to listen or takes ....While the specific system Im designing is for a small \"Wet shot\" of N02, the same general rules apply to N/A engines, turbo cars (especially pushing high boost levels)...Calculating fueling requirements for any application 101Since running a wet shot (w Low boost, and Bootmode 3 Nitrous map) I needed fuel and stealing from OEM fuel system considering the stories of failure and its inability to supply the needed Fuel...I decided to build a stand alone fuel enrichment (S.A.F.E. System as NX Express calls it).... Very simple really...Parts needed:1.In Tank or In Line High pressure pump, or Low pressure/High Volume pump...Note :N02 running through the line @ over 1000psi needs a high pressure pump and preferably a time to postpone the fuel solenoid opening vs N02 solenoid....Obviously without N02 will hit engine first and without time to richen a catastophic pre-detonantion is almost guaranteed.2.HP Fuel Pressure Regulator (By-pass Style) Adjustable between 40-120psi w boost reference Vacccum Line3.Fuel cell preferably with Level Sender or safety shutdown, Return Port, and Sea-Foam for \"Anti Slosh Purpose (Not Needed but highly recommended) As chances are, under heavy acceleration usually happens to be same time extra fuel is needed...4. SS Braided fuel hoses to run to fuel solenoid and bypass line....Rubber OE Fuel line will expand at such high pressures making delivery unpredictable.Now lets get a little more specific...Fuel Requirement 101To calculate needed extra fuel we need a few things but since this is only pumping as a N02 booster to avoid messing with factory fuel system, I will use general rules of thumb and when tuning N02 an old fashioned Wide Band 02 gauge will help me determine proper fuel pressure later on.Other gauges that make life much easier are EGT gauge, as cylinder temps skyrocket when approaching a dangerously lean mixture...SO hot they chemically fuse elements...A common reason cars used to fail emission inspections were lean LAMBDA chemically fusing the atmospheres Nitrogen and Oxygen (NOX) and with high temps often cause plug damage, erratic and uncontrolled explosions as opposed to a slow complete controlled burn of the Air / Fuel Mixture....This premature explosion is whats commonly referred to as detonation, knock, ping, pre-ignition and and depending on severity and engine durability, its commonly catastrophic and often causes engine failure or severe damage with as little as one knock event...Now,to finally get started, you need to know a few things...The more specific the better...1. BSFC- short for brake specific fuel consumption, basically the amount of fuel a specific engine requires to make 1 BHP for 1 HourA.Rule of thumb (and this is to start, fine tuning comes later)-Naturally aspirated Engines typically have BSFC around .5 lbs per hour of 93 ..Octane (AKI)-Ethanol and Methanol are higher due to there lower Potential Energy, usually around double for 100% Methyl Alcohol. So 1.8-2 pounds/hrTo get specific BSFC you really would need a dyno, so well work with generalities....*** Forced Induction / N02 cars require need about .6-.7+ lbs/hr per Crank HP***N/A Engines slightly less...2. Volumetric Efficiencyof the platform...while not needed, it makes for a much more specific end result and saves time tuning using tiny adjustments later, simply put the higher the \"volumetric efficiency\" of an engine the less fuel, as its burning more efficiently. It takes 14.7 parts air at sea level to burn one part petro based fuel. Hypothetically 100% VE would leave no hydro carbon emissions...As far as I know this does not yet exist...Moving on....Although they need MUCH more Meth, sometimes up to 2lbs per hr per BHP. This is due to the lower potential energy and \"specific heat\" a relatively large amount is can remain un-burned, absorbing heat and dissipation. Hence why it's so great as a race fuel....3: A close approximation of Brake Horse Power target...- Example: My M2 w/ FBO should be making FLYWHEEL HP in the range of 500-550 with a 50 Wet Shot on around 14PSI (Maybe going higher at the track, but trying not to get to far ahead of myself.) This is based on Older N55's nitrous numbers I found and is more conservative as a few older N55s with forged rods/pistons, WPC treated bearings were making close to 600 crank, 550 wheel... with 50-75 wet shots and water/ methanol for added knock prevention.4. The Vehicles OEM fuel usageObviously you need to subtract this from overall fuel requirement.Last but not least...5.Pumping lossesas some in line pumps can lose 5-10+ PSI some extreme cases even more... However todays fuel filters are pretty efficient. My Filter I just purchased claims a 1-2 PSI loss at 100 microns which is a fairly good filter...Also HP pumps usually result in less pressure drop than LP (all things being equal)*Note!! Inline pumps are not good at pulling, so they should be placed as close to fuel source as possibleSo now some Basic Math...550 bhp or brake hp, flywheel hp, crank hp etc (Better safe than sorry aka more fuel is 1000x's better than not enough) x's .6 lbs.hr = 330 lbs per hour TOTAL (Obviously at WOT)....Now remember. I'm still using the OEM Fuel system, so I am calculating total fuel required. BMW as most car makers utilize the same basic formula.1.They calculate the actual BSFC2.They also run slightly rich from the factory as a rich LAMBDA is much less prone to detonation...12.0-12.2 is a good safety margin, allows decent 10-15* advance, doesn't wreck fuel economy and still can make good power....Although \"Leaner is Meaner\"...Rich mixtures only cause engine damage over extended time periods as they coat cylinder walls, stoping the oil from lubricating the pistons...Here I will calculate OVERALL fuel needed and subtract what the stocks pumps supply.Rule #3Factory High Performance Forced induction cars can usually can supply approx 10% more fuel than programmed with.So, figure WITHOUT meth or N02 on lower boost levels (12-14 to start)...So for simplicity, lets say 400 lbs per hour of fuel to push 550 crank....A lbs of gas = about 6 US Gallons so 400 lbs divided by 6 gals per lbs per hr = 66.67 Gal per Hr...Considering the OEM System is already conservatively supplying close to 40 gal/hr.... I need an extra 25 gallons per hr to be on the safe side. I'm also using water methanol so this is very conservative.Lastly, we must add some flexibility in here as the amount of fuel needed at 7k RPMS and 14psi w/ N02 is obviously much higher than at 3000 rpms so the regulator comes with a boost reference.'This is the simplest concept of this whole endeavor...All these numbers are at sea level which is about 14.7 psi of atmospheric pressure....as boost rises the amount of fuel needed has a direct 1:1 correlation...so at 0psi if 20 Gal/hr is needed...And my pump pushes 46gal/hr @ 40psi  of fuel pressure (at approx 13.5v), every 10psi of boost should raise fuel pressure 10psi...easy enoughConsidering I'm starting slow and working my way up and will be installing the N02 with a pretty big safety margin and in higher temps than present....I picked a pump that at peak performance hypothetically could support 20psi of boost and a 50+ wets hot of N02...However, I dont plan on ever going even close to that so this name brand pump operating at a small fraction of its potential should enjoy long life....It's been a while but I think my math and memory serves correct. But hopefully some of you that are looking to learn read this and it will help you in the future as these rules apply to bigger turbos, super high octane race fuels and even stand alone fuel systems...Because the N55 has long suffered fueling issues, the M2  with its higher boost and more agressive tune will probably be worse...These principals could even be used for those looking to add fuel at higher rpm with the proper cooling mods and a flash or piggyback that is running much higher boost...The best part about designing your own simple ( yet effective) fuel system is cost, reliability, and giving you FULL control over the AFR without having to be a freakin hacker or dismantling part of our new engine to access DME...with one well placed nozzle capable of atomizing the fuel preferably close to the throttle body, you can take stress of our oem pump and solve a handful of problems weve all dealt with...My system cost roughly $400 for everything, and using name brand items...In the next post Ill supply links to what I used and why if your considering doing this yourself...Lastly important to note these principles could be spread across all 6 cylinders as opposed to a simple single port...Basically a simplified port injection...Feel free to ask any constructive questions....Hopefully some of you read this and are now a little more informed.",

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comAs many of you know we were fortunate enough to purchase a BMW M2 earlier than many. This Sunday we figured we take advantage of it and put some time in our R&D and testing because we are lucky enough to have a proper dyno facility and suffiecent amount of air to replicate close to real world environment.Seeing how we posted one of the first dyno runs in United States, we were not sure what to make of the power. But the car made strong consistent numbers back to back. Other vendors who we all love and respect such as the guys at iND and Active Auto put identical numbers showing the car M2 is consistent across the country which was good to know that BMW got it together. We installed a custom down-pipe on our car and the gains were fairly decent perhaps because the car had less than 500 miles and was flowing very well.The car showed 15 psi stock and we modified the factory ecu with our stage 1 tune to 17 psi. The M2 like the M4 and M5 platform is very much tuneable especially when the computer is not being tricked with piggyback that hits torque limiter or require a back end flash that requires an ecu to be taken out of the car just like ecu tuning. This motor is very strong and it does not heat soak. We did a number of back to back hard runs and the car was very consistent and impressive.One of the benefit of ecu tuning is you can tune it on 91 or 93 without having to worry about the car pull timing and drop boost because the vehicle does not like the fuel in the car etc. We are expecting to raise the boost to 20 psi for our stage 2 tune once she reached 1k because we have noticed as the car breaks in more the numbers appear to be get stronger and we got a little lazy working on a Sunday morning.We did some testing with 93 fuel and doing a E85 blend for a E30 mix on the dyno back to back from our initial back to back 93 runs. The car gained very little after several back to back runs. Please note we did not change the ecu parameters at all simply look for consistency of power and fuel mixing blend possibilities. In fact the car had a dip in the power after the addition of e85 blend. We believe the blend may help keep the power from dropping due to its cooling characteristic on very hot summer days, but it did not gain as much as we had hope and others have assumed. We are confident we can custom tune the factory ecu with down-pipe close to the 450whp range. Please be patient as we are eager to get the car fully tuned. The car will be at Wannagofast in Hot Springs VA were our shop M2 will be raced in the 1/2 mile rolling event. I know threads like this tends to create a lot of opinion, while we all respect everyone thoughts lets keep it civil.Here is a where the magic happened and the runs.93 Octane Runs93 + E85 Blend93 vs Blend on the same graph\n\nGreat results, 380whp on 93 is better than I was expecting.  Very nice what flash tunes do.\n\nApparently, some people don't believe the results!\n\n\n\n\n\nAwesome work guys!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTFS--This looks more promising than I thought it would given early returns.  But what is the significance for those of us in non-93 states?  Some of us live in Washington, for example, which is a 92 state....\n\n\n\nGreat workTTFSA few questions just to make sure, these runs were with your DP + Stage1 tune only or just the Stage1 increase to 17psi boost ? Your type of Dyno \"Dynocom\" reads like or higher than a Dynojet ?  Do you think the E85 Blend required a bit more to fully adapt and maybe show a bit more gain ?I saw Terry dyno'ed 394whp/456wtq with E30 blend on a piggyback with 17 psi if I'm not mistaken.Since I know you guys are currently testing/working still, have you tried to Dyno on 18-20 psi as well to see what number yields before DP or after DP ? Just for curiousness and seeing how the curve looks on the dyno ?In terms of ECU Flash, what parameters are being edited at the moment? Is it similar than like the N55 you have seen ? etc\n\n\n\nCan the top speed limiter be raised or removed with the flash?\n\nGreat numbers but as I know nothing of fuel types, only that in my country they use 95 or 98, would it make less power?\n\n\n\nTTFS is more than legit guys. Go over to M3F and see everything they have done for that community.As a long time E46 M3 owner, I always planned to go FI eventually and use TTFS, but the F87 called my name.Can't wait to see what you guys do with Pure Stage 2 etc etc.\n\nPersonally, I think the engine was the least attractive part of the new M2 (same engine as m235i). Would definitely be a killer with a bigger turbo and more cooling though\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hey --I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced a drone in their MPE at a specific RPM. In my case, it happens at 2750-3250. Outside of that range, everything is great but in that range there's a drone and resonance under acceleration. Flaps can be open or closed and there's the same drone/resonance.The video below doesn't do it justice as to the volume of the drone/resonance. Once I get the car back from paint protection I will take it to the dealer and drive around with a tech and see if anything is loose. But before I do that, I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar.https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7R...ew?usp=sharing\n\n\n\nIs your drone fixed?\n\n1150 Miles and still there. Slightly better. Figure I'll give it another 1000 miles before I make a decision. I'm also getting used to it so it's not as bad in my head any more.That having been said, I will be coding out ASD on 02DEC and will report back to see if that helped in any way.\n\nI have MPE and I did the ASD bypass (using the harness) and it drones MUCH less.  It's almost quiet now, which is fine.  It's quiet with valves closed, and loud when I open them up.  Best of both worlds.  (plus the sound is real--the dash cam footage of my cruise ended up sounding like a video game thanks to the ASD)\n\nI also have ASD turned off by the BMT ODB Can Flap Module and it works quite well. Natural sound in combination with the MPE is very nice. I also figured out that the vibration during startup program are mostly coming from the tips. I you really screw them very hard, the vibration from the back is nearly gone...\n\n\n\nAfter getting my ASD coded out, I think it's good on the highway flaps open or closed. Very little to any drone at cruising. However, there is still a lot of drone present in the RPM range, especially during normal city/traffic/Sunday driving. The car actually gets quieter once it passes the drone range and you can hear the motor and exhaust better.I'm going to be checking out the Akra setup fromDetailersDomainin January and if there's no drone, will be swapping. I can't live long term with the drone. It's annoying and not what I bought the MPE for. It takes the enjoyment out of hearing the ehxaust.Other than the drone though, Everything else sounds amazing. As long as you're not in the RPM range, it's an amazing sounding exhaust.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuys, I have an Akrapovic and no drone. I absolutely have no sound issues.I experienced that drone driving a manual M2 with MPE and ASD on, and I was like this noise is annoying... Even on idle I was like can someone please remove the ASD please...I choose to remove ASD, after I drove a M4 with an Akrapovic and the ASD was just complete annoying. I am happy it is gone now and I can enjoy the exhaust properly.If there is anything 'annoying' on my set up, it might be other people's feelings when I blast pass them... :PMR\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it turns out the system is designed and manufactured near to me in the U.K. and it might be worth contacting them directly with consumer feedback in relation to any drone issues, especially as they claim \"the clear target from BMW was to deliver acoustic performance fitting to the extreme sporty nature of the vehicle, without unpleasant resonant frequencies\"http://redarcheng.co.uk/news/bmw-m2-...duction-ramps/\n\nI'm catless. My drone is worse in comfort vs sport with the exhaust flap full open on both. In part I believe to the wastegate position and the active sound. I believe active sound actually helps dissolve drone around 3k. One reason to keep it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI heard it instantly, even under driving in traffic, shifting at around 3k RPM.\n\n\n\n",

I don't know why they'd design something that goes in an engine bay that doesn't fit with a \"click.\" Basically, the socket on the tuner (as you can on the left side in the picture below) is deep while the sensor wire end is not, making the four tips inside not make the right contact.

Ugh.What sucks is that it feels like the times I'm commuting it stays open just fine, but the few times I went on a spirited cruise with a local car group, the valves kept closing.

I thought the reason for the burble is those flaps I have in MPE, but when I open the flaps (track mode on MPE) the sound gets even louder, does this mean there are two layers of flaps? Or is the burble the result of engine being in sport mode? Very curious..\n\nI thought the burble was due to unburnt fuel?\n\n\n\nYes, the engineers obviously had an objective to create a good exhaust sound on this car! No fanboy, but have to say I like what they did - has its own character. Had a concern it would be obnoxious cruising around town, but not the case.\n\nYeah that's probably the reason. I read this:https://www.quora.com/Why-do-modern-...n-the-over-runand I thought it's due to flaps.\n\nCurrent vehicles have this engineered in. Cars like the F-Type, Focus RS and also the M2 have been engineered like this.In case of the F-Type they spray a little bit of fuel in the beginning of the exhaust near the manifold that ignites in the exhaust and you gets you the burbles. At least that is what an engineer at Jaguar told me.More and more cars have some kind of system engineered in and by changing the mode on the car the system inside change and give you a different exhaust note.It could well be there is a second flap some cars, but I did not see this flap when I changed my exhaust at Akrapovic. There was nothing there other than the turbo and then the downpipe.MR\n\nWhen the flaps open your sound changes because its bypassing the muffler. Maybe they do some stuff with tune too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrect! There is different mapping between each mode which changes the amount of snap crackles and pops the M2 makes!",

Supporting Mods, Octane #, PSI/rpm and AF/rpm would be the minimum that's requested to disclose.You've been waiting and thinking for long before post the result, you must know curves and pictures mean little.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want to hear the M2 with the pops&bang function.\n\nOh yeah! Expect to get a call from me in the coming months!A few questions:- Is your \"Map Switching / Multimap\" thing available on the M2?- How traceable is the remap (thinking in terms of warranty voiding)?- Does the ECU have a \"write count\" which the dealerships can easily see?\n\n\n\nFull stock cars, only MPE & 98 OCTANE (EU FUEL)Any chance you meant 98 Ron (93 octane)?\n\n\n\n\n\nawesome to bad im so far away.Do you guys tune remotely?\n\nI would lend you my car for rev match deactivation but im far away.Can you guys tune remotely?\n\n\n\n370 stock/ 420 after tune obviously is bhp and not whp correct? My car got dynod stock and was at like 336whp that's why I ask. Just making sure here. Thanks! And awesome results and graphs. Pretty freakin cool to see all that.

    "content": "Hey all! Today I installed a jb4 and want educated advise on which map i should run. As of now, my m2 has an aftermarket intake and catless downpipe. I always run 93 octane\n\nMy understanding is that it should be Map 2.\n\nMap 2 would be your best bet.. Terry has said map 1 & 2 work very nicely on the M2\n\nSoooooo how do you like it? Stock compared to intake + down pipe + tune?\n\nCould map 7 also be right?\n\n\n\nTerry recommends, do a log on map4 first (good logs) and then drive map1 for a while and do some logs see how your car reacts.Since the M2 engine has higher stock boost than standard N55 (that the JB4 N55 maps) are configured for it will be a little different.Start slow first and post your logs onhttp://www.n54tech.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=35Did you install the EWG-add on connector?Make sure you're on latest firmware before running map1 also, can easily be done via bluetooth with the jb4 mobile app.These below are the maps and for standard N55.Stock M2 runs 14-16 boost so you can see map1 or 2 can have you running higher boost than standard N55 with map5 or 7.Map 0: JB4 disabledMap 1: Additive target, around 4psi over stock.Map 2: Additive target, around 6psi over stock. Suggested for those with 93 octane and bolt on modifications. Also good for small E85 mixtures.Map 3: Progressive methanol mapping, absolute target of 11-20psi based on meth flow, meth additive setting, and average ignition values.Map 4: Stock performance with JB4 active for logging only.Map 5: Autotuning map, absolute target of 11-17psi based on octane and conditions.Map 6: User definable absolute target map. Suggested for troubleshooting by professionals only.Map 7: Race gas map. Absolute target of 18.5psi. Requires straight unleaded race gas.I'm running map4 when the weather is 90F+, dont need anything breaking and the stock power in my X4 M40i (Same engine) is more than enough for Daily.I run map1 with 93 and use map2 with e85 blends, and Map5 (while logging always).I'm running map5 as of today going to try it out for a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart at map 1 , post a datalog\n\nonly map 1, map 2 needs race gas mix or meth\n\n\n\nUnless you know what your doing Map 5 could  easily kill your engine...Letting users define AFR and Timing advance AND BOOST. Most even car people have no clue how these parameters affect each other and cause detonation. Most dont even REALLY know what detonation is...Scary...Im an old JDM tuner that used to tune from scratch stand-alone systems and Im afraid to touch Map 5....FSocietyis  smart too, hot weather like this, whats the point...stockkin  it is the way to go...Once it cools down or I get a water/C02 intercooler chiller and bigger FMIC Im being conservative until at least the 60s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason why I want the JB+ after reading these posts lol\n\n",

    "content": "Me and my buddy \"LeonTheJeweler\" went for a nice long drive yesterday afternoon under the GWB and got some pictures and videos taken. We figured we'd do a little comparison video of his exhaust compared to mine.Alpine White M2 (Leon)- Active Auto full exhaust system that comes with their own downpipes already attached + Eventuri Intake + Active IntercoolerLBB M2 (mine)- MPE + VRSF catless downpipes (my eventuri is waiting to be installed)Both cars were in Sport+ mode (I think lol)In my opinion they both sound great in their own way. The MPE with the VRFS in my opinion doesn't sound as clean and refined as the AA full system but both sound extremely mean and great either way. Personal preference I think. Great thing is I can close the valve with the MPE and make it sound a lot less crazy and it really changes it. The AA system overall is just a beauty and sounds unbelievable all around.Hope you all Enjoy! (Sorry only way I know how to post videos here. If anyone knows how to post it straight on the thread please let me know how lol thanks!)https://flickr.com/photos/145139844@...57677043080296\n\nNice video\n\nThis is one of few \"sound clips\" that really make senses.First of all, both sound great! That being said I'd agree with you that AA system seems to have more \"clarity\". IMHO, the downpipe is the game changer here. The AA \"clarity\", which is a little bit higher pitch than the raw sounding MPE, would not have been that impressive without a DP amplifying it.BTW, I'm undecided on MPE for a while. Till this day I still think it's too less gain over stock system for 3K5 USD, but whatever anyway, already paid 110K for the stock car. There is something special about having gains from OEM parts, plus I read many reviews on it which is all great except 2 problems that doesn't seem to be fixed - 1) Drone at 2750-3250rpm and 2) Vibration during cold start. Do you experience those 2 issues as well?\n\nI can honestly say that of all the exhaust's available for this car, Active Auto takes the cake. It's just that good!\n\nSo what does everyone think on here?\n\n\n\nNice videosVapeconj\n\nGreat video! Both are very different sounding exhausts I feel James MPE with DP is a much more aggressive tone that tends to get very loud up top with a higher pitch. The active is smoother sounding throughout the powerband. In this case they both sound great but just appeal to different groups of people.\n\nWhat exhaust tip options are available for the AA??\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely like the MPE / VRSF combo more.\n\nNice review my man !\n\nNice!!\n\n",

No need to go hunting for hardware to finish the installation.Developed and tested on the race track!Limited Lifetime Warranty.It's well known that the N55 engines runs very hot.  Turbos that build a lot of heat and a small radiator play into why this engine runs so hot.  A quick look at your gauge cluster on your dash after a few minutes of \"spirited\" driving, you'll notice oil temperatures over 250 degrees.  Considering that most cars don't even exceed 230 degrees tells you quite a bit.  As oil temperatures get too high, thermal degradation occurs.  This is when the oil starts to lose viscosity due to heat and start to break down and becomes more susceptible to \"shearing\" or oil breakdown. An internal combustion engine like the N55 engine, imparts high shear forces on the motor oil, which is sandwiched between two rotating or sliding forces under load and heat.  \"Shearing\" is when the molecular structure is essentially torn apart by these mechanical shear forces.  Lower your operating oil temperature will greatly reduce this.  Thus your motor oil is in better shape to protect the bearings in your car's engine, thus improving longevity.The M235i/335i/435i/M2 comes from the factory with a small oil cooler with a core size of 8.75\"x4.75\"x1\" (222mmx121mmx26mm) which comes out to 41 cubic inches of core.  The Sports Series Oil Cooler system features a large 11\"x8\"x2\" (280mmx203mmx51mm) oil cooler with a core size of 9\"x8\"x2\" (229mmx203mmx51mm).  The Sports Series Oil Cooler comes out to 144 cubic inches  of core which is 3.5 times larger than the factory unit each!The Sports Series Oil Cooler mounts to its own box enclosure.  This style box was developed on our 135i Time Attack race car and is brought here to our new F30 applications  Louvers on the backside of the box enclosure ensures airflow through the oil cooler while protecting the oil cooler from road debris, especially debris kicked up from the front tires.  During initial testing, our box enclosure had a big window (open hole) in the back for airflow.  However, throughout the race season, it took so much abuse from rocks, tire and other debris kicked up from the front tires that we had to replace the oil coolers on our Time Attack 135i.  Thus, instead of a big hole for airflow to flow through, we used louvers instead to protect the back side of the oil cooler.  This effectively solved the issue without any affect on performance.  Oil temperatures as well as oil temperature deltas stayed the same.Kit Options:When the oil cooler box enclosures are used in conjunction with our optional ducting shroud kits, the oil cooler box enclosure actually seals and forces all the airflow captured by the ducting shrouds through the oil cooler cores.  Improves the oil cooler's effectiveness and efficiency.  The ducting shroud kits are available in aluminum.  These are model and bumper specific so make sure you order the correct shroud kit.Car Model and Front Bumper\tAluminum ShroudM135i/M235i\tAvailableM2\tAvailable335i\tAvailable435i\tAvailable\n\nCool!  This plus the BMS catch can will help a lot at the track\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't think I've seen the car crack 225-230 yet at the track running very hard. The cooling system on the M2 is well sorted compared to models in the past with N55 engines.",

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comOver the last few weeks we have been working on our ECU Remap/Flash on our M2. The car is currently stock bar the ECU remap. We will be adding downpipe, exhaust, FMIC and Intake over the coming weeks/months. We will also be working on a back end flash for those running JB4.As the N55 in the M2 is essentially the same as in the M235i we were expecting to get the same results. For reference a stock M235i makes anywhere between 333-345 BHP (flywheel) on our Dyno Dynamics machine.The ECU tuning process requires removal of the ECU so that it can be flashed on the bench. During this process we can also unlock the ECU so it can be in the future flashed via OBDII using our Evolve-R cables.evolve_bmw_f87_m2_lowered_dynobyEvolve Automotive, on FlickrThese are our initial dyno graphs with the car using 99 RON (93 Octane) pre and post tuning. They are the highest stock figures vs the highest tuned figures tested back to back.Flywheel PowerEvolve M2 Stage 1 ECU Remap FlywheelbyEvolve Automotive, on FlickrWheel PowerEvolve M2 Stage 1 ECU Remap Wheel PowerbyEvolve Automotive, on FlickrWe will be providing verified Vbox tests as soon as we get a chance to do some runs. It does appear this platform will be limited on bolt ons and tune and hybrid turbo will be required for those wanting some serious gains.The tune is certainly noticeable on the road with the car being more responsive and providing a nice linear power delivery which means the car is still very tractable/predictable.\n\nNice gain throughout the band, looking forward to your results with dp.BTW, any boost over stock?\n\n\n\nSolid! Curious to see how much of that improvement is dialed up boost vs fuel and timing. Extra points for transparency and this being the first official F87 flash release.\n\n\n\nAny testing on 91 oct? Gains? For us SoCal folk...\n\n@FSocietysnap!\n\nWhat does the M240 make on your dyno?\n\nWould like to see boost pressure and AFR mapped on that. Some weird fluctuations at the lower RPMs.\n\nI'm really not impressed !Only 23 BHP is definitively not a great gain for a ECU tune on a turbo car...On my last Porsche 996tt the Softronic ECU reflash gave a huge 80 BHP gain for about $1,500 CDN.  Compared to that a small 23 BHP gain seems very little.I was expecting something between 40 to 50 BHP gain, less than that would a loss money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfaik Porsche 's 5.2 twin turbo 917/30 was/is the world's fastest racecar ever: 1200bhp , but BMW got 1500bhp in quali trim from its 4pot 1.5 litre turbo in the Brabham BT52 F1carCheersRobin\n\nIf I were to get a tune on a Turbo engine with around 370 HP I would hope for a little more gains though.

DCT or manual?\n\n\n\n\n\nHoping for some good info/numbers as I will be looking to come see you guys when my car comes in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are talking about the internals of the M2 version of the N55, I am sure you are right that it is capable of significantly higher HP and torque numbers, and safely, but I'm also pretty sure those numbers would need a different turbo, wouldn't they?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe already have an example of 370whp M235i w/ tune, DP, IC running 93oct and a 430whp M2 w/ tune, DP on 93oct. No E85. Same dyno. So something is different.\n\n\n\nI just want to state that Enzo's dyno does read a little low according to him...So let's route for big gains as opposed to big numbers...It's pretty well established that the M2 in stock form w/ 93 makes about  330 at the crank and up to 370 on e-85...on the \"average dyno\" even more on the notoriously optimistic dyno'sPersonally I'm not paying much attention to the baseline numbers...I've ran into plenty of fast cars the last few weeks and based on these \"run ins\" I know my car is tough and under-rated. Especially considering I'm breaking it in and in the case I do go WOT, Im still shifting well below red line...If he gets me 30-40 whp out of the car on top of the baseline e-85 blend numbers I will be more than happy...I'm also bringing my stock cat in case he wants a baseline 100% stock. As I'm guessing there will be a calibration available for stock catted or sport catted cars and one for cat less cars.Unless he feels the DME is capable of adjusting itself for minor changes, I will be buying engine mods as fast as they are released and suspect he will require additional R & D as parts are released that make major changes in the cars drive-ability. I will be ore than happy to donate my car in the name of science LOL.\n\nOut of curiosity how do you maintain a e85 blend? Is that a manual process?Does the car have a e85 friendly fuel system I've been out of the loop.\n\nThe gas cap states E-10 is fine...Which means thats conservative.  If you go 3/4 93AKI and 1/4 8-85 which is 85% Ethanol, 15% gasoline and detergents (BP e-85 detergents are bmw approved) ....if you do the mathe thats 40% ethanol in 25% of the tank.E-100% would be 25% ethanol. 50% would be E-12.5...40% is a ittle under 10%I was told from a very experienced N55 guy 30% was OK...avoid much higher...There are reasonably priced systems that measure ur ethanol percentage...Perhaps another user could get more specific.\n\n\n\nThese will do the trickhttp://www.zeitronix.com/order/order.htm#SECTION_ECA\n\n",

    "content": "Just wondering if there are people who ordered their M2 with the manual transmission and regreted their decision after living with the car for some time?After much doubt, reading reviews and testdriving both (manaul + DCT)....The 6MT gearbox in the M2 is not perfect, but in the end I liked it bit more then the DCT version and I ordered my M2 with manual transmission. Delivery is in 1,5 months and I'm very exited that the car is coming....but the choice of the gearbox keeps buzzing in the back of my mind.For me the gearbox was a difficult decision and I hope that after some time owning the M2 I still feel that I made the right decision of ordering the 6MT.  But only time will tell!\n\nLove it after a month and a half. Had a long drive back from the PCD and it was never a burden. Have done traffic jams every now and then and still not a burden.Its much more engaged than a DCT so my preference was being more involved while driving the car than being faster.\n\nI don't even have my car yet but can tell you I'm 100% happy with my choice. If the M2 was DCT only, I wouldn't have bought it.\n\nLove my 6spd.  A agree with the post above...if manual wasn't an option i wouldn't have purchased one.\n\nLove the manual in my M2.It does feel good and shifts well for my needs. I like the rev-match features.If I was looking for performance only, I would have gone with DCT. But I am in the old-school clan and I vote to save the manual even if I think there will be more M2 with DCTs.You are doing a good choice. (I would have said the same thing if it was a DCT, because it is YOUR car).Notes:- it is not my daily driver, but my DD is also a manual car- I am not a track rat\n\nIt's definitely an above average transmission setup with the 6MT.The clutch is a touch light and long, with the engagement point somewhat high, but it isn't a deal breaker. The feel of it is pretty easy to adapt to. The shifter throws could be about 10% shorter. It's not an S2000 or B5 S4 transmission. But I'd put it on par or slightly better than my E36.I will say, though, that the 6th gear ratio was squarely designed for the track and autobahn, with not nearly enough overdrive for the North American road market. At 80mph, the difference between 5th and 6th is very, very small, which leaves you cruising at about 3k RPM.\n\nBest choice I ever made. Comming from \"manual - SMG - manual - DCT\" to my M2 I can report that the 6MT is far better than in the E92 M3 and much more emotional than the DCT in my former Z435is.I hated the auto blip in the beginning, but now I really love it. Best feature for a 6MT. I only hate that I have to put myself in danger to turn it of, but ok, I can live with it.I also noticed from some reports here, that the clutch feeling seem to be different in the US compard to German. I was not able to mount the Burger clutch stop mod in my car, because it is simply not needed and does not work with my EU spec.\n\nReally happy with the 6MT. Came from a 7MT in a base 991 and this just works so much better when pushing.Haven't tried the DCT though so can't judge that but was not a fan of PDK when I used that in a 997.I like the fact that there is rev matching when I'm feeling lazy and that you can still turn everything off when on track before you get your new tyre\n\nThanks for the replies and thanks for votingI received an email today that my M2 will be deliverd to me in 3-4 weeks time and this also means I can not change any specifications anymore... Manual M2 is coming...!\n\nYou will NOT be disappointed. The M2 manual is excellent (not perfect)! It's simply a pleasure to use; I think this is one of my favorite parts of the car. This is controversial, but I love the auto-rev match, even though I know how to heel-and-toe downshift.  I drive in the DFW metroplex, and I have wished for an automatic (aka DCT) exactly zero times.  I honestly wish I could shift it more often, and I drive about 40 miles each day 50/50% highway/city.Note, I did drive the M4 with DCT one time , and I thin it's an awesome choice if you don't know how to drive a manual or if you have a lower extremity disability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really didn't care for it at first (came from a 135 with DCT) and wish i would of got DCT after a few weeks of driving the car. But once i got past the break in period and also installed BMS clutch stop, it's been great and no regrets now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a loaded survey question. Sheesh!\"How much do you hate your transmission?\"\"When did you stop beating your wife?\"\n\n\n\n6mt here for me. Had dct on my f80 2016. Nothing beats a manual transmission still\n\n",

Have come across comments like \"improves throttle response\" and sounds more \"volumous\" but for its price, is it giving you more poke?\n\n\n\nI honestly would say that you feel weight off the grind a 10% punch there's a noticeable difference. And sound oooooo baby that sound fire !!!!!install was a little pain in the ass I wouldn't do it myself getting that from bumper piece in looked little complicated. But the boys did it in a hour.\n\n\n\nPlease can you post a video with the sound ? Does it come with any maintenance instructions i.e. re-oil filter or replace after specific miles etc ? It does look amazing !\n\nI heard Leon's car with just the eventuri and downpipes from VRSF (I think?) and it sounded really unbelievable man. Looks awesome too obviously. But the sound inside and outside the car is really what makes it great IMO",

    "content": "Got some pics from the unwrapping of the AkrapovicA quick description from the Akra site.Made from ultra-lightweight high-grade titanium, which will lower the overall weight of the car and improve handling. This perfectly finished ECE-approved system has been tuned to get the most from the TwinPower Turbo six-cylinder engine of the M2 and is designed to deliver more power all the way across the rev range. This new system features two separate tubes from the downpipe to the muffler  unlike the cars original single-tube configuration. It is perfectly routed and shaped to provide optimum gas flow from the M2s stunning engine and deliver a noticeable performance increase. The sound has also been enhanced by Akrapovičs engineers; the unique external sound is higher in pitch, giving a true racing feel in the upper rpm range. The Evolution Line is perfect for everyday use, with low-rpm driving smooth and refined, but still showing the true potential of the system  and, when higher revs are hit and the valves are permanently open, the sound has an addictive racing tone. A simple plug-and-play system offers a superb addition to improve the performance of the BMW M2. Carbon-fibre tailpipes give an added look to the rear of the M2, to display its sporting potential. Performance can be further increased with the addition of the optional downpipes, which can be purchased with or without cats. To set off the system to its visual best, optional parts are also available.---------------I'm already excited with Akra with such extreme attention to detail in just the packaging alone. Quality!install photos and sound clips coming soon.\n\nSoo sexy !!!\n\nPhil, As always a great write up, excellent pictures and quality parts! True enthusiast as well as being one of the most stand up and quality detailers in the north east!\n\nthanks Jeff appreciate it!  It's a very nice set up.  I have Chris and the guys over at Park Ave BMW finishing the install today.  Hope things are good over there.\n\nExcellent taste, you will not be disappointed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat story!Next time switch on Traction mode and then listen what you hear!MR\n\nLet’s talk about the installation process. Akrapovič estimates 3 hours to do this. It is not as simple as removing the stock system and tightening up the Akrapovič. Whether or not you spring for the Sound Kit, there is some minor work that must be done under the trunk liner on the left-hand side of the vehicle. More on that later.Now for the fun stuff:The Akrapovič Evolution system for the M2 includes virtually everything you need for the install. Before anything, note that you can find theOfficial Akrapovič installation manualWhat's in the box:Installation manualCompliance Documents (if applicable)WarrantyAll necessary fitting materialsControl ModuleSleeved Matte Carbon TipsAnd of course – the Muffler & Pipes.Tools required:Nitrile gloves – this is imperative! Any finger prints left on the titanium will burn in and leave some nasty looking marks. Nobody wants that on a system this well put together.T-handle swiveling 13mm wrenchT-handle 6mm three hexagon wrenchTorx 30Torx E10Torx E1216mm SocketBefore installation please note that Akrapovič provides torque specs for every bolt that needs to be tightened. In addition, they include their own Bolt Sealant, Anti-Seize Copper Paste, and Anti-Seizing Grease.On to the install.The factory exhaust is a single piece with oval piping all the way back to the muffler, a resonator, and a flex section just before the downpipe. The picture below shows the factory resonator, flex piping, and the chassis brace (which gave us a little headache later in the install).Get the car up on a lift and follow the directions closely. You don’t want to make the mistake of mounting the exhaust before wiring the control module it comes with.Now the fun begins.Start by loosening the chassis reinforcement plate underneath the vehicle.We ran into some difficulty removing the clamp from the OEM downpipe here as the bolt on the clamp seized. We cut it off and installed a brand-new replacement. This also meant we needed a replacement gasket – nobody wants leaks. So you’re aware, this single-use gasket does NOT come with the equipment in the Akrapovič box.You may want a second person with you to support the weight of the muffler. Remove the exhaust hangers and drop the system. Simple enough, the OEM exhaust is off the car.Nice touch on the heat shield.Set everything aside and bring the car down. We now have to wire the control module that talks to the valves. To do this, the trunk floor and left-hand side liners must be removed. It’s easiest to remove the side liner with the backseat folded down. Upon removal we’re focusing on connecting the Akrapovič Control Module with the additional Sound Kit to the main wiring that runs through the trunk.For the sound kit to work, you must set two of the wires from the main harness inside of the Can Sniffer supplied by Akrapovič. You simply set them on the device, no cutting necessary. The instruction manual specifically states that the wires to be attached are yellow/red and yellow/brown. It also states that if two groupings of this color exist, use the one that is less tightly intertwined. One small problem: we had 3 groupings of the same color.We kept the liner out of the trunk for easy access to the Can Sniffer later on.Beauty - Time to setup the Akrapovič.Had some clearance issues with the Chassis Brace. That’s what happens when you move to dual piping! We attempted to rotate the Akrapovič but it would then rub against the heat shield. The fix was to add washers for clearance, although this solution isn’t ideal.Excuse my forehead.Before mounting the tips, we lowered the car and put it in radio ready mode. We had to ensure we had the right wires running through the Can Sniffer. Good thing we left the trunk liner out - we had used the wrong set of wires initially.After fixing this mixup, the valves were functional and the Sound Kit remote was communicating with the valves as well.With everything put together, we tightened up the wiring and put the liner back in the trunk. The M2 is ready for delivery.As far as the tips go - they play well with the Gloss Carbon M Performance Diffuser despite some initial concerns. Alignment was a breeze. I took it for a short test drive to ensure no rattles or vibrations and that was that. No issues, time for pickup.We staged the M2 on our Delivery Center floor. It's not every day you see an M2 like this one. It drew tons of attention, and every angle begged for another photo to be taken. I'll leave a few of those below.As far as sound goes, nobody ever said louder is better. Make no mistake, the Akrapovič certainly is louder, it is the perfect enhancement to the stock exhaust note. Tons of snap crackle pop action. It's throaty as all hell and you can feel the engine breathing much more freely given the combination of the Eventuri Intake and Akrapovič Evolution Exhaust. I had the pleasure of driving behind the M2 with the newly installed Akrapovič system and it was all music to my ears.Not the best video but some great sound bytesA huge thank you to HRE Wheels & Akrapovič for the hassle-free process and super fast shipping. Also cannot thank Phil DetailersDomain enough for making this happen.Also a big shout to Mo for the time he took on this installation.The system was supplied byHRE WheelsWe have an open door at our Delivery Center by the way!

It is absolutely beautiful, but you can only really see the blue hue under bright light. Not sure if it's worth the added investment. Because I received one of the first units, Eventuri hadn't posted installation instructions to their download site yet. It's a Saturday, so I figured I wouldn't be able to get some direction from either IND or Eventuri. I took a chance and emailed Eventuri and I was shocked to get a response later in the day. HUGE kudos to Bilal Mahmood, Eventuri Engineering and Development. He promised to develop and publish installation instructions immediately, even though it was 10:30 pm there! He emailed me at 2:00 am their time with the document. Exemplary service!!! Installation was pretty straight forward, except the ram air scoop behind the grille. Of course, that entailed removing the accursed grille which is never an easy job. Tip for those contemplating purchasing and self-installing this: install the bracket for the ram air scoop first, then attach the scoop to the bracket. You'll never be able to properly tighten the nut securing the mounting bracket to the cross brace if you do it the other way around per the instructions. Extremely high quality item, commensurate with the price. Haven't driven the car yet due to the late hour. Further review to follow. But so far, I'm loving this thing.\n\nSuperb car porn, at the very least!  Did you ever get satisfaction that this design is effective for getting cold air?  I haven't seen temp numbers on this piece for the M2, although I have seen good temp numbers on Eventuri intakes for other cars....\n\nI do think the air scoop will increase efficiency. I have an Awron, so I should be able to quantify temperature differences. But it is absolutely beautiful.

All i can say is if you're in the market for more sound or power or both than this mod should be on the top of your list.  I'm extremely happy with Fabspeed's product.

Everything was fine for about 200miles and than popped a check engine light. (Btw only have 700miles)Haven't had any drivability issues like some other members have but def want to find a fix in case this does happen to me.The codes were for post cat O2 sensor and outside air temp sensorMods  Dinan exhaust vrsf DP only.\n\nUntil all information is analysed and I have a clear answer my story does not really belong in this topic, but for now I can mention I had four limp modes on the autobahn at speeds above 210 up to 270 km/h, and I have an Akrapovic exhaust + down pipe with catalytic converter installed.This is my story:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1317706A question from my end to the people in this topic; what kind of error messages do you find when you read out the on-board computer of the car? I would love to know if the DP installation throws similar messages across all of our cars. This way we can find a trend and see what the solution might be.MR\n\nAs I stated mine were post cat o2 sensor and outside air temp sensor. I'll have to check for specifics tomorrow\n\nThis is the main reason why I always recommend our Sport Cat Downpipe over out Catbypass. Although yes, you can tune it out but why go through that hassle of it coming back on? All for what? A couple more horsepower. To me not worth it. Definitely interested to see where this thread goes and what issues people are having.\n\nThe check engine light isn't so much of a concern because well that's expected when you go catless but possibly going into limp mode or throwing other codes is where the issue is. Going catless has more advantages than just a few HP but I get it your trying to sell your product.\n\n\n\nI've had a DP installed on my car the 2nd day I got my car, but mine has a 200cel cat so I didn't expect a code anyways. I have racked up about 8000kms already\n\nCatless downpipe will throw a CEL code not limp mode.If you are getting limp mode, something is wrong with the car, has nothing to do with downpipe (unless you damaged the O2 sensor when replacing the stock DP)\n\n",

During the the running in we mostly used BP Ultimate 97 RON (equivalent to US 92 oct) and the first dyno was carried out on this fuel. We then filled up with Shell V Power 99 RON (equivalent to around 93/94 oct) is our normal fuel of choice.The result is not completely scientific but we tried to make sure the conditions were as similar as possible. It gives an indication of the difference the fuel makes on a stock car.evolve_bmw_f87_m2_lowered_dynobyEvolve Automotive, on FlickrOur dyno is a DynoDynamics machine which reads much lower than Dynojets.

We will get some comparison graphs up soon so you can see the difference.Over the coming weeks/months we will be developing the ECU tune (in beta testing), FMIC and downpipes so will provide data on these as we progress.\n\nWhat an interesting comparison,  that's a noticeable increase with different fuel grades.  You can see the increase mid range,  right where the timing would be getting pulled on the lesser grade fuel and then again at top end.

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comWe had the M2 at Sebring for the second time yesterday and it was an interesting day to say the least.See our first track day writeup at:http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1261307The car setup was as follows:Nitto NT05 275/35/18BC Forged RZ38 18x10 squareBC Racing BR Type coilovers with camber platesMotorsport Hardware 14x1.25 -> 14x1.5 conversion stud kit (highly recommended if you use an impact to remove and install wheels like I do)Motorsport Hardware 12mm Traklite front spacersActive Autowerke FMICActive Autowerke true 3.5\" DownpipeActive Autowerke complete 3.5\" Exhaust systemActive Autowerke flash tune (15psi)IND cosmeticsAWRON Vent GaugeBMW Performance Rear SpoilerThe car was corner balanced and aligned by Apex Alignment two days before the event.The Drive:With the new suspension, alignment and wheel/tire setup I knew the car would be different, but I was honestly a bit skeptical because in stock form the car was so good! On the 2.5 hour drive up to the track I noticed that the steering sensitivity had increased quite a bit. The car reacted so quickly to steering input as if it was toe'd out (we set it at 0 toe). While this was a large improvement over stock I was now almost worried that the car was going to be too loose.On track I quickly forgot my worries and after a few warm up laps I began to get comfortable. The turn-in was so amazingly sharp but not uncontrollable at all. I had read reviews about the M2 including one from Bill Auberlen and I remember him saying that instead of understeering, the car would just hold it's line and accelerate through the turn when you applied mid-corner throttle. I never experienced that with the stock M2 (probably because I tend to overdrive cars) but after a few laps with this new setup I realized that this was exactly what Bill was talking about. At the point where the throttle would usually just initiate a slide with the stock car, I found that now it would just make me go faster. When I did manage to get the back end out, it was always more of a throttle steer than a drift and the car would continue to accelerate through the slide instead of just roasting the tires without gaining speed.The car was fast. During the morning sessions when temps were coolest we managed to trap 136.7mph on the back straight compared to the 129mph that the stock car did. Back in May going through Bishop's Bend wide open from Tower Turn was a little hairy, but doable. With the extra grip and power we were still able to hold it wide open out of Tower and around Bishop's and with the increased exit speed out of Tower we were now exiting Bishop's at 116mph compared to 111mph in the stock car. Unfortunately as the day went on the track got so hot that our speeds ended up being slower than the stock car at multiple points on the track, but the morning session was proof that the car really had improved.Overall the car was better in every way. An already amazing car was now even easier to drive and even more importantly even more fun to drive. I do believe that a slightly stiffer spring rate all around would help take advantage of the NT05 tires that we were running, although it would be at the price of some street comfort. We do plan on running a set of the new BC DR dampers with stiffer swift springs the next time around.Results:The track was extremely hot. Track temps were 110*+ it was taking it's toll on the car. Fluid temps rose and the with the new sticky tires the brakes were working much harder to slow the car down.Unfortunately the day didn't get any cooler and the best time we could put down was a 2:30.3. We dropped 1.9 seconds from our baseline back in early May when track temps were about 20 degrees cooler. At Sebring 1.9 seconds is about 375 feet (about 25 car lengths) going down the front straight which is a significant improvement, although I'm positive that with better conditions the car is capable of a mid 20 lap time. Looking back I should've suckered it up and pushed for a solid hot lap during the morning session yesterday while temps were somewhat normal.I will say that I'm disappointed in the car's temperatures after only a few hot laps. I saw maximum temperatures of:Oil: 259*Water: 229*EGT: 1762*For the next track day we plan on changing oil to a thicker Mobil 1 Racing oil (we are currently running OEM BMW 5w-30). We will also be adding our methanol injection system as well as potentially a larger oil cooler.Keep in mind that the conditions yesterday were extreme, and I admittedly was not being easy on the car at all. However, with 93 octane fuel and only 15psi we were seeing temps that I didn't feel comfortable running with. Thankfully the AWRON vent gauge we installed provided all of this numerical data because with the OEM cluster as my only source of information I probably would have kept driving**We have a video of the track day in the works which will be posted once it's been edited.\n\nSo hot it melted your license plate holder.I imagine you've pushed the M3/4 under comparable conditions, how were the temps holding up on the older siblings? Be a neat comparison with M3/4 'track' oriented cooling systems.\n\nman that's hot, to mangled a license plate frame like that\n\nLarger oil cooler would be nice to develop and produce to the M2 community. Have people upgraded their engine oil coolers on M235i vehicles?\n\n\n\nawesome development and documenting on this car. love the new wheels, i was looking at HRE, forgeline, BBS, but now i really like the bc forged rz38. if you don't mind me asking, how much are those wheels?i can't wait to get my M2! going to do alpine white and 6speed as well.\n\n259 isn't terrible if you're pushing higher than stock boost and it's hotter than hades outside.  How long were the sessions and how long before oil temp hit 259?\n\n\n\nDavid, did you check the stock water temp gauge just for shits and giggles? I'm wondering if it actually works or if it just goes from cold to warm and stays there like my Landy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove those wheels!!!

So manually drained oil to find 5 ltrs in the sump.Forums say, its the tensioner and belt or idler pulley.Can someone pl help?",

This question also include sport cat replacement.\n\nTwas never a problem with mine. 135Even a couple of broken chargepipes didnt effect the claim.\n\nMy m135i has been back in for routine servicing, recalls and \"QEP's\" with sport cat DP and JB4 in situ - no issues.If leaving JB4 in situ - just remember to set to map 0 and drive the car for 20-30mins to remove any \"trace\" of JB4 canbus monitoring from OBD2 port so as techs can plug n play into the car's system's w/o any issues.\n\nnothing. because they can't void your warranty over an exhaust modification. if you're worried about passing emissions though or not having a CEL just google iO2 cat sim\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's nothing to debate. Hence why I'm asking what people are doing when bringing their cars to dealers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless you are taking the car for a problem that can be related to downpipes, the dealership will not give you a hard time ... I have never been asked to remove the DP before dealership visit\n\nI just do the work myself.  Really don't want most dealership techs touching my car, I care about my own car more than they do.  There are exceptions to this, I had a friend who was a good tech at the local BMW dealer that I would request.  He actually cared about the marquee and did his best out of respect for the brand.  But techs like that are few and far between, from both my experience and from what he tells me.\n\n\n\nFor those of you who went catless, install your cat back on and be environmentally responsible please\n\n\n\nMy experience with my M235i has been a breeze. My car has our Sport Cat Downpipe and Muffler Bypass Exhaust. I've taken my car in for a couple service appointments already and have never been questioned once about it. To be honest, majority of the questions are people asking why it sounds so good!\n\nDitto as above with my m135i with sport cat DP and MPE my local bmw service dept are very complimentary about how it sounds and handles !\n\n\n\nBetter be safe than sorry, install the OE DP and have no issues with the dealer.",

Seems like a simpler and less expensive mod than gutting the muffler.Thoughts?\n\nThe exhaust flow in MPE can bypass the muffler with electrically controlled valves opened, I believe that's what makes the difference.Akrapovic uses an  identical muffler design but only mates it to a split dual pipe configuration to pursue a better flow capacity in the middle section at the cost of the high velocity of the hot air coming out of downpipe, of which I really doubt the gain outweigh the loss, HP/Torque wise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if back pressure is reduced. Is the velocity also reduced?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real question I am having here, is whether BMW cheaps out on m2 exhaust by not using a dual system, or m2 power level just don't have that flow for a dual to support.And what is the dia of Akrapovic dual pipes? Down pipe outlet is 3.5\" so the combination of the dual shouldn't be larger than that, which is why it doesn't make much sense to me in the first place.Someone enlightens me or gives some real world before and after please. Until that, Akrapovic is a merely sound mod with no hp loss at best.\n\nFound one reason for a twin pipe design...http://www.supersprint.com/ww-en/wha...gn-system.aspx1. ability to increase velocity and still have cats2. ability to design out droningMaybe Akrapovic's found using two pipes allowed them to better tune the sound?",

    "content": "Hello everyone.Very happy to say that I finally received my M2, after 6 months from ordering and paying a 10% deposit (yes I know but there's only one dealer in Kuwait and this is how it works). Anyway, I'm loving the car, it is by far my favorite car I have owned in my 17 years of driving.No complains just the usual comments which I don't mind. However, I noticed that there's not much difference between comfort, sport and sport plus when it comes to the exhaust sound. It sounds sweet but really couldn't tell the difference. Perhaps something wrong with the flaps/cutouts? Today I tried the \"hidden exhaust\" mode by driving in comfort with MTM and it works. Actually, that was the only time I felt a difference. Will have it checked when I take it in for the first service but I was wondering if the flaps are viewable from the back? Is there any way I can physically confirm whether or not they are opening/closing?Thanks,\n\nCongrats! I have not noticed any difference between modes. The \"hidden\" mode is the loudest for sure.\n\nDoes anyone even preview their post anymore before posting? Neck hurts looking at that pic LOL kidding congrats on the new whip!For the modes, can't really tell the difference in sound. Maybe when cruising on the highway in comfort will be the quietest. For the exhaust flap being open, you won't notice this until you give it full throttle. Basically the way you can tell if the flap did open is you'll notice residue on both sets of exhaust tips. Flap not open, you will only see the right set of exhaust tips have residue stuff\n\nLol, sorry about the photo guys had it posted from my mobile. Here's a video of the sound, 1st 3 revs in comfort, following 3 revs in sports plus, final 3 revs in comfort with MTM (DCT short press).\n\n100% agree with you. I dont notice any major differences in exhaust sounds either in low to mid range revs. However, the exhaust burbling is most noticable in the \"secret\" comfort MDM mode, followed by Sports +, Sport, and then \"normal\" Comfort mode. So the exhaust burbling I find are different between the normal modes.But this is great for daily commuting in Comfort mode but get the nice crackle and pops while putting around town.However, I imagine the exhaust revs would be much more noticable with MPE or other aftermarket systems. Either way, stock sounds plenty good enough for me. Much louder and way better tone than my previous car (435) with MPE.Congrats on your car =)\n\n\n\nA couple of follow up questions.1. I know the car doesn't have a boost gauge but them why is there a selection for pressure unit (psi/bar/kph) under language and units.2. The car has comfort access and under the options I have driver door, all doors and comfort entry. What is comfort entry? Without selecting it I do get keyless unlock/lock of the car.\n\nSorry and here's the other one.(Didn't edit the previous post because I can't seem to upload more than one photo, one replaces the previous).\n\nCongrats on the car, I spend 90% of the time in the secret comfort mode as well. Haven't really listened out for the other modes. I know Sport and Sport + does sound louder in the car via the speakers.1) I believe the pressure units are for tyre pressure read out.2) Comfort Entry, When you unlock the car by pressing the button on the remote control twice, the windows will be lowered when you open the door. This helps you get in the car in tight spaces.Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I get that people like to mod their cars and wish them well...my question is are there really any performance gains from these bolts ons w/o modifying the ECU? I know people are posting before and after dyno runs but what about a week later when the car adapts and removes those gains?For example, BMW says the MPE provides zero performance gains b/c the turbo (or ECU forget which) adapts to compensate for the increased free flow. Sure if you like the sound have at it but are there really any gains to be had?Then according to thishttp://www.catalyticconverter.org/ne...erter-&News=89there is no such thing as a performance gain from a \"high flow\" cat or catless downpiple. Not sure who this source is and if they have an ax to grind or if they are truly trying to educate?  Again, if you like the sound have at it but are there really any gains to be had?\n\nMPE won't give you any gains because it doesn't improve flow, its just a nice noise.Going catless allows you to get some power but it needs a map from something like a JB4 to get your hands on it.From reading Terry's posts theres maybe 20-30hp to be gained on 93 octane with a decat, better intercooler and a tune.More than that is in the realm of ethanol or turbo replacement.The n54tech.com boards on the N55 cover it quite well. From a power perspective the M2 N55 is exactly the same as the other N55s BMW have released, just with a more aggressive tune from the factory. Internals should be stronger though.\n\n\n\nSorry I edited my post with some more info while you were respondingIncorrect, JB4 lets you modify a ton of stuff and has standard maps out the box for our car that will see a power increase\n\n\n\nThere are 100% definitely performance gains to going with a high-flow cat or full cat bypass. The ECU will recognize higher flow and make a minor adjustment. This adjustment is not substantial enough to keep up with the amount of extra flow that a high-flow cat or catbypass. More airflow = more power.I have had my Sport Cat on my car for almost a year now and it still pulls just as hard and definitely harder than stock. Check out our dyno graphs below of the power we made with our Sport Cat Downpipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Some minor M2 specific software changes will be added, of course.3) All of the cool in dash controls we've added to the F Series JB4 are  compatible. CANflap works, in dash boost gauge works, map switching  works, boost by gear works, 6cyl timing logging works, and it even logs  the DCT trans oil temperature.4) The platform appears to be E85 friendly. More on that later.The bad:1) This is simply based on my initial few hours with the car. But from a  performance perspective,it appears to be basically an N55 with a tune  from the factory. It's not in the same universe as the S55 M3/M4 motor  and even appears to be a step down from the B58 found in the new 340i.2)On normal pump 91 octane fuel running its factory 15-16psi boost  profile it had fairly significant timing pull and only put down 330whp.  Subsequent pulls did even worse as it heated up.3) We added an E30 mix on the dyno and the factory power jumped up  nicely to the 350whp range and it was also more consistent. Even at this  power level though the car had a strange behavior where it would  momentarily drop boost for no apparent reason, resulting in a noticeable  \"hiccup\" in the dyno chart. Maybe something that will be fixed via a  future software update or perhaps related to the E30 itself without  tuning in place for it.4) I raised boost around 3psi just to evaluate it on the E30 mix and the  result was pretty respectable power. Around 390whp. Which, is what the  normal 335 F30 EWG cars make on E30 at roughly the same boost level.Potential Tuning Gains:E85 Mix: I expect we'll be able to get power up to around 425whp.91 Octane: There is no power to be picked up via tuning on 91. Just the extra features via the JB4.93 Octane: I'm hopeful with good 93 octane we can pickup at least 15-20whp and similar torque.Bottom Line:It's a cool little platform. But basically appears to be a more aggressively tuned M235.From a power potential perspective, we'd have been better off with a B58.\n\nWell I'll be on 93 and an e85 mix so I'm excited.\n\nYup, and again, there are reasonable priced, reliable aftermarket solutions for the turbo size...so no real worries.$900 gets you a very nice top end. $2500 gets you 500 bhp.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm really hoping somebody does a direct ECU tune for this thing. I'm sick of seeing these lame piggybacks that don't offer the user the ability to tweak their own parameters.\n\nIf you have e85 gas station nearby adding 65rwhp is pretty nice. Like he mentioned in the \"post\" 420rwhp will be pretty easy.If that's not enough there is always Pure.But yes, yesterday's results were quite disappointing until e85 was tried.\n\n\n\n\n\nI know what you mean, we ran Motecs (and much older systems) in our FSAE cars a decade or two ago.Yup, with just the JB4, you can achieve good results with either setup.A backend flash alters the stock ECU tune (either expands factory ranges of operation, and/or shifts control of certain parameters to the JB4 for more control). The JB4 itself is a piggy running over top of the factory tune. So a backend flash, like a traditional tune, is altering the factory tune, in one aspect of another.More specifically, for the N55, the backend flash changes the base fuel and timing map to better match you'd want for larger turbos, so the JB4 has less work to do altering on the fuel and timing end.Not sure where stand alone flash tunes with the N55 are.You can read a bit here...(edit, that's for the N54...let me find it for the N55 big turbo swaps)http://www.n54tech.com/forums/showthread.php?t=20563But literally a google search for N55 backend flash, BMS, etc. will provide a lot of info. There's a few years of solid tuning/background out there...which is very good new.\n\n\n\nThis was already posted in the turbo thread by I believe it deserves its own thread/ discussion.

It is not exactly the same as the M235i N55 with a flash tune (as he claims)... so that casts some doubt on where he is getting his info.Personally, I will keep mine stock. Not sure I need much more for a DD and don't plan to track it at this point.  Others might have different plans of course... and maybe I will get jaded with the power level after a while\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome really good positives there.\n\nIt already has its own thread, in the correct forum?!http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1253475\n\n\n\nIn the UK we get high quality 99 octane.

The first task was checking the weight of the car!In the end the car weighted in at 1582 kg with some papers, small gear and cables in my glovebox, but that was about it. I removed all the big heavy stuff. That would have acquainted for like max 500 gram in total. In the back of the car there we some spare lights bulbs for the car, the manual booklet and so on, another 500 gram. The fuel tank was 80% full which is about 42,5 liter, which is roughly 32 kilos.So let's deduct this from the 1582 and we get 1549 kgs for my spec car with fluids in the engine (oil, fuel, etc). Not too bad knowing that my car has a high spec and has a M-DCT.Secondly, we did a dyno run today. No tuning, only checking the output. The final output was 376 hp @ 6,500 rpm and 566 Nm @ 2,000 rpm. This is 6 hp higher and 66 Nm higher than the manufacturer says. Interesting!I am uploading a video now which will show the run. Exhaust note is bleh. I need a better sounding system. This sounds like nothing. Although I had my tuner drive my car and although he said it is a lot more civilized than the 1M, it sounded not too bad hearing him drive it on the industrial area.Also I had a short go in a 400 hp R56 MINI Cooper S... That was like W T F fast...MR\n\nNow that is some gorgeously linear power delivery from a turbo engine, damn!\n\nNice investigative write up.It makes me wonder what could be achieved if they used lighter panels,1440kg maybe...Have you any plans with regards to tuning ?\n\n\n\nAnd the video:\n\nHm, I'm kind of curious what you did to your tail lights...\n\n\n\nThis power measurement was at the wheels or estimated at crankshaft?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,Just received my new M2 and really enjoy it after the F10 M5 DCT it replaced.I've been driving manual cars my whole life (but not BMW) and I think this one has some strange behavior.Each time I shift from 1st to 2nd gear, the car hesitates for an instant just after I've released the clutch pedal for 2nd.It feels as if software doesn't let the car pull immediately after changing to 2nd gear. Or as if the engine has lost boost after upshifting.As a result, the car leans forward every time I shift 1-2. I tried giving it some throttle between gear changes, but this doesn't help.This effect is most pronounced when starting uphill, and is less pronounced when shifting 2-3.I think it is trying to protect the gearbox/clutch, because I have never experienced such behavior in other manual cars.Any ideas are welcomeThe car about 300 miles on the clock.\n\nIt's bit normal and it will take you some times to get use to it.My advise, release the clutch bit gentle and when engaging in second gear be gentle again.Once again you will find the golden spot over time, trust me.\n\nOne thing to note from my Z4MC: the hill assist does seem to \"delay\" clutch engagement on steeper slopes, mostly to do with how the brake mapping is set up.Can't comment on the rest as my car is waiting for a boat\n\nIt's a combination of losing boost and the car protecting the drivetrain by limiting torque. Try going full throttle and shifting above 6500rpm and you will notice that you'll have full power after the shift. BMW has programmed the ecu to drop boost between shifts during normal driving, but by redlining the car they allow you to hold a bit more power.\n\nThanks for the replies guys, the car is under 1200 miles, so no revving above 5500\n\nNoticed this too on 235i, same tranny though\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Featured onBIMMERPOST.comCheck that front lip, oh and ///M mirrorsThe BMW M2 checks most of the performance boxes and has plenty of everything to keep the driver enticed, but sometimes, 370PS (365hp) and 465 Nm (343 lb-ft) of torque are just not enough.Or thats what Alpha-N Performance reckons, as the German tuner uprated the M2s straight-six, twin-scroll turbocharged engine in three steps; to 400 PS/394hp and 580 Nm (428 lb-ft), 415 PS/409hp and 600 Nm (442 lb-ft), and to 430 PS/424hp 620 Nm (457 lb-ft).The Stage 3 upgrade comes without a top speed governor and includes a racing downpipe without catalytic converters. As optional equipment, Alpha-N Performance offers customers the chance to opt for a free-flow silencer with throttle control for a throaty racecar exhaust note.To keep it in line with the oomph under the hood, the tuner bedizened the M2 with an aggressive body-kit, which includes a choice of three boot lid mounted spoilers, one of which is an in-house designed, fully adjustable, carbon-fiber rear wing. But if that doesnt get you going, Alpha-N Performance says itll offer an M4 GTS lookalike rear wing from Edison Composites, or theRacing-Style M235i Motorsport wing shortly, as well as other M4-style carbon-fiber components.Completing the visual package is a matching splitter for the front spoiler and a set of OZ Racing Ultraleggera HLT alloy wheels in mixed 9.0 and 10.0x19-inch sizes, shod with 245/35ZR19 and265/35ZR19 tires.Further improving the vehicles stability through the bends is a Öhlins fully adjustable Road & Track coilover suspension that lowers the ride height for a more purposeful stance and improved chassis dynamics.Soure:http://www.carscoops.com/2016/07/alp...bmw-m2-up.html\n\nLooks tough.

Can someone provide their thoughts around the MPE? What are the benefits?Thanks!FYI, BMW of Austin now has an M2 on the lot which I drove this morning. Just F'ing awesome! Wow!David\n\n\n\n\n\nI test drove one with and without the MPE. For me the MPE was the missing piece on the stock car maybe the stock exhaust sounds good but the car is wel isolated inside i missed a little bit of the thrill of the beast she actually really is.When you then start up the MPE for the first time your smile will go behind your ears.Good thing is with the flaps closed its still respectively quiet inside. You can choose what you want.For me it's definitely going to be a mod straight away when I finally get mine.\n\nThanks all for the input. I appreciate it.\n\nMy short answer is - it's really nice, but you don't really need it.  The stock exhaust has enough character and is loud enough.I had the stock exhaust while doing ED.  In sport +, I got all the burbles, pops and even a few loud bangs that I wanted.  The car and I think the sound attracted a lot of attention as it was.  It definitely put a smile on my face and I loved driving in slow/medium traffic as I shifted gears.  I loved driving in tunnels or roads with barriers next to them.When it was delivered back home, the MPE was installed.  The exhaust is still very characterful and perhaps a slightly louder volume than stock in the street/sport mode.  In track the mode the MPE sounds a bit more mean and raw and even louder still.  Now do I enjoy the MPE?  Hell yeah!  I now look forward to stop and go traffic jams and find myself shifting ( manual car ) more often than I really need to because it's just so fun!In the same situation, would I enjoy it even with the stock exhaust?  Yes definitely!  But perhaps with a little less drama, and perhaps my smile wouldn't be as big, but I would still have have a big smile!",

    "content": "Hi Chaps, I hope you can help with whats maybe a dumb question but I'm a newbie to the whole BMW tuning stuff.I've seen all the benefits to fitting one of the Catless downpipes ie. better performance, sound etc. However I understand this is likely to throw CEL errors. I also understand that by installing the JB4 system that this will remove the CEL's as and when they are raised?However, when I take my car to get serviced, I'd understandably want to remove the JB4 unit etc.. This would leave me with the downpipe and vulnerable to CEL issues on the way to the garage and during the service.How do you guys avoid this or am I thinking too hard about something that will never happen.\n\n\n\nIm going to install a catless dp on my m2 within this next month. I will eventually go get a tune( JB4) to get rid of the CEL error. Im pretty sure once u install a catless without a tune, u can dive around 50-100 miles before the car throws the CEL error. Personally i don't care about the CEL. But for you I'm thinking if u take out your JB4 when having a catless, it might act as the system just noticed that there is an error with the O2 sensors. Meaning it might give u that 50-100 mile range when taking out the tune before it throws a CEL. Im not sure, but I'm thats my gut feeling. Luckily for me, I'm friendly with the ppl at my BMW and they will allow me to have mods in my M2 without warranty issues, so no hiding over here haha. Best of Luck! Which DP are you considering?\n\nThanks for your inputs. Yes I will take your advice and speak to the service department at my dealers re the catless downpipe and judge their reaction accordingly. At the end of the day I guess its an exhaust component and that doesn't feel as intrusive from a mod perspective as certain other enhancements.I've looked at a few options on the different products and have to say I haven't quite made my mind up. I'm keen to get some more feedback on experiences from fellow forum members prior to taking the leap having only just got my car I guess.There seems to be a lack of outputs/development on the JB4 side of things too other than the fact that its compatible with the M2 rather than having specific firmware tuned specially to get the best out of our cars. Hopefully this will move forwards in coming weeks too.\n\nEither get a high quality catted downpipe or get the VRSF catless DP with CEL delete\n\n^^^ very true, I'm going VRSF because its so cheap! Don't buy a crazy expensive catless downpipe because its just a straight 3-4\" tube. a CEL doesn't matter that much but get a tune like JB4. I agree with you on the fact that there seems to be a tune lacking for specifically the m2, and it seems like there are tunes compatible with the m2 but not focused to optimize the m2s full power. personally I'm going to run a catless, get a CEL, and wait for the right tune.. best of luck!\n\n\n\nI've had some interesting developments over past couple of days. I've been speaking to a very high profile exhaust and performance company who are proposing to use my car in development of a full new exhaust and high flo cat downpipe etc. As soon as the date is agreed and the car is dropped off then I can  reveal more!!",

The GTR does handle ALOT better but thats expected. However, the M2 is so lightweight and nimble that its a pleasure to drive at any speed and anywhere in the powerband. Under 4000 RPM the GTR was just boring. Im a really huge fan of this vehicle. It could use more power though.\n\n\n\nSo how do you know when you have E30. My GTR told me on my dash display the exact percentage of ethanol in the tank. I pretty much ran E85 only. unfortunately the blend here in my state never exceeded E68. Injectors and fuel pumps were an absolute must as were 3\" intakes (and obligatory matching downpipes) due to the significantly increased fueling.Also, with the GTR the ECU of course had to be tuned with a dynamically scaling software that read the ethanol content analyzer and automatically adjusted the tuning based on that. How does it work with a JB4 or even an ECU tune on this platform? I pretty much never had to switch maps unless I wanted to play with boost off the line.So my assumption (please correct me if Im wrong) is that if I want to piggy back with JB4 and run E30 then all I have to do is switch to the proper map and guesstimate the ethanol content by manually mixing 91 (E10) and E85 (actually E68) ?How sophisticated are ECU tunes on this platform? EcuTek is pretty much my personal gold standard (excluding standalone ECUs like Syvecs).Sorry for all the questions. Just trying to get more details on this platform before diving into mods. This is my first German car ever.\n\n\n\nThanks for the great information. Man ive stared at about 100 logs on my GTR as I tried to wrestle with high IDCs and missing my target AFRs. The car ran rich until the day I sold it. but was very reliable otherwise and most parameters were where you would want them.So to run E30...all I need AT MINIMUM is a JB4. Is that correct?I assume larger diameter intakes will require an ECU tune or will the JB4 compensate? I guess Im not quite sure how far JB4 can take you when chance the air flow specs and fueling demands.Also, what is fuel-it?Thanks again for all your help.\n\nLuminouscryptocarcan chime in\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you will need is an analyzer that measures ethanol content and a way to send a signal (0-5V) to the ecu.This signal neds to be calibrated and properly tuned to provide additional fuel to achieve the correct ratio. Ethanol requires around 30% more fuel to achieve the proper afr.Keep in mind you will run out of injctors (or fuel pump) sooner when you are on corn juice.\n\n\n\nthat's why it's important to corroborate your local e85 gas station with a second methodology. there are lots of ethanol test kits available online but of course those are manual and require that your are very accurate in your measurements.\n\n\n\ndon't forget the hygroscopoic nature of E85 attracts water quite vigorously. in my lab we have absolute ethanol (E100) and it is very hard to keep it at E100 as the container gets more and more empty which is why it's important to keep your tank full of e85 rather than half full which would increase the chances of water absorption and hydrolock of the injectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nYMMV, the blends and additives are so variable from gas station to gas station. I never had a problem personally when running E85 but if you lived in a humid climate and had a quarter tank and left the car for several weeks you may have problems. I know it happened to some GTR owners who drove their cars infrequently.\n\n\n\n",

That is to say, in comfort mode with the flaps closed, you'd be hard pressed to tell much of a difference other than on acceleration where you'll hear more turbo spool and noise.\n\nThe CEL makes me a bit nervous. Fabspeed just released a DP that doesn't trip one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut OP, I think you'll like the DP.Maybe more importantly, you KNOW you're always going to wonder if it's for you or not. And it's cheap enough, with good resale.Go for it, for sure.You can always recoup most of the price if you decide it's a bit too much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I was chatting with a service guy at BMW regarding the warranty issues on doing a catless downpipe.  According to him the current cars are now storing ECU data on the BMW cloud servers regardless of whether you bring the car in.He literally told me that he can call into BMWNA  and they pull up the VIN to see what's been going on and if it's been re-tuned and all that. I'm assuming they could also tell if it's been running for year with a CEL for the Cat being gone.  Of course you're fighting an uphill battle with any warranty claim at that point.Is this true?  Seemed like a bit much, but I know my car is online.\n\n\n\nThat's some Big Brother shit right there\n\n\n\nI'm sure it's BS...Microsoft would never help them suck all the user data out of the car!https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow...es-to-bmw.html\n\n\n\nBet the fuckers are selling BMW consumer data patterns.

After finishing up the tuning on our Mustang dyno we drove over to a local shop to get some Dynojet numbers.The car currently has our prototype downpipe and intercooler installed, and with some information provided by our friends over at TTFS we reflashed the ECU and are now running a consistent 15-16psi at the intake manifold. The fuel has been cleaned up and now richens sooner with a nice taper at the end. With an additional 3-4psi the car is going to make great power.We plan on having our complete exhaust and meth system complete next week as well, so stay tuned for updates!\n\n378/414?\n\nmeth + 93oct\n\nNice!\n\nThe power that was generated was done with no intake mods? I note that is the one area that BMW improved over the M235i.\n\nWhat fuel is that on\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this is prob max reliable to expect with a flash tune on 93oct w/ downpipe and intercooler?\n\n378 whp 414 wtq with tune, downpipes, intercooler and 93 oct gas? Sounds pretty good. With a final tune and some tweaks this car is going to be pretty strong with meth or e85.What were the stock numbers on this dyno?\n\nSo when will the intercooler and tune be available?\n\n\n\nIs this a catless DP? I was just comparing this dyno to the fabspeed one with sport cat on stock tune. It looks like peak torque is about the same, though it looks like you guys sustain it a bit longer and hp is up about 30 or so. Idk, I just expected a tune +catless DP would yield more drastic improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally find this pretty encouraging. Active 8, fabspeed DP, and bms intake all for under 2k and we should get 60+ HP and 80+ TQ on 93oct with amazing sound?! That's a big time win! I don't plan on tracking the car so I will pass on the intercooler. Just a guess but if a stock m2 is running 12.7's in the quarter mile I think a stage 2 will easily get to the mid 11's\n\n\n\n\n\n378whp / 414wtq 14-15psi seems like what another M235 FBO just did with 91 octane in SoCal at 14psi though.Active, do you guys have the Dyno on the Dynojet graph I saw the previous post was on Mustang Dyno. Not sure how to compare 378/414 without seeing what it did on the same dyno before the tune and mods ?Cheers\n\n",

Also, the exhaust is constructed from stainless steel, so don't expect much weight savings over factory. The focus is on sound improvement (and aesthetics) with this exhaust.  The choice of stainless steel was made with the M2's price segment in mind].Q: Any power gains from the M Performance Exhaust?A: Few gains should be expected just from changing axle back exhaust on a turbocharged BMW because 1) the main restrictions are in the two catalytic converters, which are retained with an axle-back exhaust and 2) no gains should be expected without remapping the ECU because the ECU is always correcting, so for example if the car loses backpressure, the ECU will reduce power.Q: How do valves operate on the M Performance Exhaust?A: Valves are solely driver-controlled using an included bluetooth remote (see photo of exhaust remote from a MINI, which the M2 remote will resemble).  The exhaust valves do not automatically open or close at a certain RPM.[From Jason: the remote may come in packaging which should fit in the cupholder to act conveniently as a remote holder].Photos from SEMA of a preproduction M2 M Performance Exhaust:Sauce: 2ertalk\n\nI was first!I'll remove mine though, you had more info!Edit: meh, I can't delete mine.\n\nOh.

However the tips are angled upwards (yellow lines) and also of a bigger diameter (90mm to stock 80mm). This closes the gap to the diffuser by 10mm that provides a more aesthetic visual.

On the other hand, the MPE sound great in track mode (but too loud for a DD) but not in sport mode just like if the flaps were staying closed.What a tough decision to take !\n\nI plan to just throw a VRSF downpipe on. I've heard clips where this is plenty..for me at least. That's until we start seeing some aftermarket exhaust.\n\n\n\nThe stock exhaust sound pretty much exactly like my F30 335 sounded with Akrapovic. So it sounds just fine to be honest.\n\nI agree with metrickid.  If you run on sport mode in the city you get more than enough pops and bangs on the over-run and people will turn and look.  Bear in mind this is not high revs either, its just cruising along at 50kph/30MPH and releasing throttle for a square turn.  The other night after work I was driving home uphill in sport mode at 50kph and a traffic policeman in a marked car turns on and tails me.  I started getting self conscious and dialed the mode back to comfort to avoid undue attention.  Haha.  If I could avoid a CEL I might consider a catless DP at some stage (not illegal here) but not tempted by a full aftermarket or MP system at the mo\n\nI ordered an MPE and then cancelled it after watching more vids and realising it wasn't going to add much to the car. Stock Exhaust is loud and has character, if I need more down the line then I'd rather get a downpipe and a tune to add some power.\n\n\n\nhaha sorry not having a dig at people with itIm sure its great.

That trans was absolutely telepathic in D anticipating what gear I wanted. Also lightning fast and firm on the shifts. The M2 in comparison is not any of this. Since it's the same trans underneath it can be fixed with software if BMW sees fit to do so. I had an option of taking my HEA M2 as is with the DCT or waiting. Since I thought the DCT in my 1 was good I figured it would be the same so took the HEA. It's not. If they don't fix it I'll be in the camp of wanting the manual.\n\nNot in my car...

I havent tested the m2 but Ive driven a late e92 with DCT and loved that.\n\nIts only laggy in comfort / auto mode ive found. I dont use those modes.\n\nnot laggy at all hereif you are driving slowly, it will shift softer, the harder you drive, the harder it shifts\n\nTry doing a throttle body adaption reset and then maybe a gearbox adaption reset too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't use comfort.

    "content": "Question for the experts;  Is S55 Engine swap possible on M2.There are several complete S55 engines with low miles available (including ECU and sub-components).  I am having the wild thought purchasing M2 and mounting S55 engine.  Any ideas, thoughts on such possibility would be appreciated.\n\nWould be possible if you have the $$$http://www.carscoops.com/2016/02/ac-...s-bmw.html?m=1\n\nhttp://www.bmwblog.com/2016/03/01/ac...va-motor-show/\n\n\n\nLet BMW M do that for you: M2 CS (MY 2018).\n\nArtemis,Please esplain....\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything is possible. To get the engine installed in the car is the least problem here. It's fundamentally the same architecture, so expect engine mounts etc to be a direct swap.Where you start facing issues will be with adapting the engine wiring harness needed for the S55 engine and mating it with the wiring harness in the M2. And then you need to get the proper software installed... Either by getting S55 software/mapping in the M2 dme or by using a S55 dme and have that set up with your M2's VIN etc. Since you can't order a S55 dme with a M2 VIN number from BMW, you need to change the VIN afterwards... And with the security and encryption built in, it takes some expertise and work to mate a S55 dme to your M2.If it's possible to remap a M2 dme with S55 software then that would be the better solution I guess.Modern cars that have CAN bus electric systems are also way more complicated to do these kinds of transplants on than a \"good old\" E30 with a M5 engine etc.Manhart in Germany do these kinds of engine swaps all the time. But it's expensive and time consuming. Expect it to cost just as much as you paid for the M2... The cost of the S55 engine is probably the least expensive part of the swap... (Unless you do all the labour, software work etc yourselves)\n\nThanks a lot.  I appreciate the reply.\n\nI posted this over on 1addicts as this mostly pertains to the E82:If you are planning on doing the swap, a few things have to be addressed. Firstly, steering. The subframe mounting can stay the same, but if you are planning on keeping the OEM plumbing for the turbos, it won't work. The rear turbo inlet will hit the frame, so custom fabrication is required. Secondly, the top-mounted heat exchanger won't clear the factory hood. It will either be necessary to have an aftermarket hood, or seek alternative cooling solutions (such as the typical front mounted intercooler with the secondary cooling system deleted). Then there is the steering. The location to bolt a power steering pump to the S55 interestingly enough exists, thus making either a swap to an existing F80/F82 possible, or a swap of the S55 into an older hydraulic steering vehicle less complicated. A \"crossover\" module for PT-CAN information will have to be installed and coded to intercept the bus information to convert to the older style cluster and FRM. Dynamic shifting has to be coded off, otherwise every time you go to downshift, it will redline the engine due to the transmission not having individual gear sensors. DSC will also need to be tweaked for different power input. There are other small physical compatibly issues, as well electrical/coding hurdles, but that's the basics of it.Also, You also have to double up the fuel feed lines and put in a T connection with a fuel line suitable for low pressure. The S55 has two high pressure fuel pumps that need equal feed pressure. In terms of cooling, the heat exchanger coolant reservoir must be relocated to the drivers side (instead of in the back) to clear the hood properly. If anyone has any more questions, feel free to message me.\n\n",

Car is stock except for a VRSF downpipe.Some other info:  When the electronic coolant temp gauge first says \"ok,\" the oil temp is only 140f.  This is NOT ok!  Once the marker is in the middle the oil temp is 180f, which should be fine.  I think this will be a useful marker for people - knowing oil temp is 180f at the middle setting will give a more concrete point of reference.The stock intercooler sucks.  On stock boost I was hitting 120f intake temps with a 60 degree ambient, and that was just on a 2 gear pull.  I would not be surprised to see 140f temps on a 3,4,5 gear pull.  This doesn't surprise me considering it is the exact same part number as the 335i intercooler, except running 6psi more boost...  I ordered an Ambient Thermal Management intercooler that will be installed on Thursday or Friday.\n\nGreat info.

Sheesh....BTW, when selling your E36M3 and removing the aftermarket exhaust to reinstall the factory exhaust with the car in the garage, don't get the bright idea of starting the car to see what it sounds like...not that I would do that...just saying...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, when I purchase a car like this, I want that growl to let people know that I'm driving a beast.

Once the 340i solution and its hardware is finalized the tuning itself is pretty quick in the grand scheme of things and typically is about a 30-60 days lead time as we already know the engine.

    "content": "BIMMERPOST NEWSNew extensive range of BMW M Performance Parts for the new BMW M2 Coupe72COMMENTSTweetAlso see our FAQ on M2 M Performance Parts @http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1191101Munich.The new BMW M2 Coupé (combined fuel consumption: 8.5 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 199 g/km)* sets the benchmark in the segment of compact high-performance sports cars when it comes to driving dynamics and performance. Its extrovert design further underscores the cars highly dynamic character and outstanding suitability for the race track. From March 2016, the dynamic qualities and the visual appearance of the BMW M2 Coupé can be further enhanced with the newly presented range of BMW M Performance Parts. They comprise components derived from motor racing for the areas of aerodynamics, engine, cockpit and suspension which meet the very highest standards in terms of functionality and design.Aerodynamic components for an improved appearance and driving response.The M Performance Parts product portfolio features a particularly extensive range of aerodynamic components made of carbon-reinforced plastic (CFRP or carbon fibre). These include front and side sill attachments, rear diffuser and mirror caps that are perfectly harmonised in their aerodynamic effect and additionally emphasise the powerful exterior design of the compact high-performance sports car.The front and side sill attachments in combination with the rear spoiler and diffuser from the BMW M Performance range optimize the airflow around the vehicle, for example, which in turn impacts positively on handling and driving performance. Matching these there are carbon fibre exterior mirror caps which stylishly round off the cars enhanced sporty appearance with their striking look. The same applies to the M Performance radiator grille for the front and side in high-gloss black with integrated BMW M logo in the BMW M colours red, blue and light blue.Options for engine, suspension and brakes that enhance dynamic performance.The M Performance flap silencer system makes for more intense perception of the engine sound. Its two operating modes Sport and Track can be set by Bluetooth remote control. The Sport mode is intended for use on public roads and indulges the driver with a distinctive sporty sound that has been specially harmonised with the BMW M2. Meanwhile the Track setting further intensifies the volume and character of the exhaust sound, perceptibly enhancing its emotional flair. This creates a much more intense driving experience and makes the driver feel more closely connected to the car. The M Performance flap exhaust system further enhances the BMW M2 visually, too, with its high-gloss silencer unit including deep-embossed M Performance logo, tailpipes with a diameter of 80 millimetres and perforated inner pipe. As an alternative there are also carbon fibre tailpipe trim elements available for the M Performance exhaust system with a diameter of 93 millimetres and integrated BMW M logo.The BMW M2 Coupé can be fitted with the BMW M Performance coil-spring suspension so as to optimise road holding and handling. This reduces ground clearance by at least five millimetres as compared to the standard suspension. And the coil-spring technology can be used to lower the vehicle by an additional 20 millimetres. What is more, the shock absorbers can be adjusted to 16 levels in the rebound stage and 12 in the compression stage. This means the driver can create his own suspension set-up according to personal preference. Whichever setting is selected, the tighter basic set-up as compared to the standard suspension reduces the pitch and roll movements of the vehicle superstructure, thereby ensuring a highly neutral driving response and maximum direct feedback to the driver.The BMW M Performance sports brake pads offer increased suitability for the race track as well as enhanced active safety. Their composition is derived from the long-distance brake pads that have become well-established in motor racing. This means the BMW M Performance sports brake pads have a particularly high resistance to thermal stress and do not show any fading tendencies even when constantly subjected to extreme use. They also offer an improved, more direct response as compared to the standard brake system.Options for the interior inspired by motor racing.The interior of the BMW M2 Coupé can also be given a definite touch of personal sporty style with the addition of BMW M Performance Parts. For example, the BMW M Performance LED door sill cover strips for the driver and passenger side add a stylish and striking accentuation directly as the door is opened. The same applies to the M Performance floor mats, which are not only sporty in design but also offer optimum grip due to their non-slip surfaces made of rubber and textile fibre. The stainless steel pedal covers are a perfect match here: with their pronounced rubber profiles they effectively prevent the foot from slipping off the brake and clutch pedal.BMW is one of very few automobile manufacturers in the world to offer its own steering wheels with Alcantara cover for retrofit purposes, and the BMW M Performance range actually includes two different models. The M Performance Pro steering wheel with grip areas covered in Alcantara is particularly marked in its shaping and generally has a harder foam body than the standard steering wheel, resulting in better grip and a more precise steering feel. It also has a light blue central marking at the 12 oclock position. The three-colour M seam and the optional open-pore carbon fibre trim element with M Performance inscription give the M Performance Pro steering wheel an especially attractive visual appearance.In addition, BMW offers the M Performance steering wheel with race display and carbon fibre trim as standard. With an integrated function display in the upper steering wheel rim, the driver always has a perfect view of information such as section and lap times, longitudinal and transverse acceleration. The functions are intuitively controlled by menu buttons integrated in the thumb recesses of the steering wheel. In addition to the race display there is also a gear shift indicator: two bi-colour LED light strips on the right and left that run towards each other.The BMW Performance range for the interior is rounded off with the M Performance Interior Kit Carbon, featuring trim elements for the twin-clutch transmission gear selector level, centre console and handbrake handle and the M Performance interior trim finishers with their especially attractive blend of Alcantara and carbon fibre.Also see our FAQ on M2 M Performance Parts @http://f87.bimmerpost.com/forums/sho....php?t=1191101VIDEOS:Listen at the M2 M Performance Exhaust System fitted on the M2 MotoGP Safety Car [details]PHOTOS:\n\nPretty sick.

    "content": "BIMMERPOST NEWSBMW M2 M Performance Parts announced at SEMA 2015241COMMENTSTweetUpdated 11/4 with Q&A from SEMA 2015At SEMA 2015, we had a chance to speak with BMW representatives Stefan Weiss (Product Manager for M Performance Parts), Eric Reichel (Lifestyle & Accessories manager) and Jake Mooney (Accessory Specialist – Exterior, M Performance and Motorsport) about M Performance Parts for the BMW M2.Q: Is there a front splitter lip coming for the M2?A: No splitter lip, but there will be functional bumper winglets for each front corner (see live SEMA photos below), which mirror the rear ones.Q: Are the front bumper winglets and and rear wheel winglets functional?A: All M Performance aero parts are functional and designed in the wind tunnel.  The front winglets provide downforce and the rear winglets help direct airflow.Q: What are the details of the M2 M Performance Suspension?A: It is a non-adaptive, 2-way adjustable (rebound and damping) full coilover kit with custom strut and springs, manufactured by KW to BMW M's specs.  It's also been tested on a four post rig and at the Nurburgring.  Lowering range drops the car anywhere from 5mm to 25mm.The suspension's finish has been specially treated to a black chrome finish to prevent corrosion and rust. The shape of the springs prevents any side loads from being transferred to the dampers, increasing its long term durability.  The suspension kit will come with recommended settings for street use and select tracks in the US when the product is launched.Q: Any plans for a carbon ceramic brake package?A: Not at the current time.Q: How much weight will the M Performance Exhaust save over the factory setup?A: No figures yet because still in preproduction form.[From Jason: the pictured exhaust is still preproduction so the final production exhaust may look different.  Also, the exhaust is constructed from stainless steel, so don't expect much weight savings over factory. The focus is on sound improvement (and aesthetics) with this exhaust.  The choice of stainless steel was made with the M2's price segment in mind].Q: Any power gains from the M Performance Exhaust?A: Few gains should be expected just from changing axle back exhaust on a turbocharged BMW because 1) the main restrictions are in the two catalytic converters, which are retained with an axle-back exhaust and 2) no gains should be expected without remapping the ECU because the ECU is always correcting, so for example if the car loses backpressure, the ECU will reduce power.Q: How do valves operate on the M Performance Exhaust?A: Valves are solely driver-controlled using an included bluetooth remote (see photo of exhaust remote from a MINI, which the M2 remote will resemble).  The exhaust valves do not automatically open or close at a certain RPM.[From Jason: the remote may come in packaging which should fit in the cupholder to act conveniently as a remote holder].Q: Any chance we'll see M Performance Seats available for order?A: As of now there is no M Performance Seat in the works. However, if there are pure racing seats that are not homologated for the US that would be available at some point in the future, we would explore the possibility of selling them only throughMotorsport (racing) Centers.  Anyone looking to purchase motorsport parts through an approved BMW Motorsport Parts Center (see link above) is required to sign a liability release waiver stating the parts cannot be installed by a BMW Center and the vehicle will be used for off-road use only.Q: Will M2 have striping option?A:[From Jason: yes, as seen in the photos from SEMA]Q: Does the M2 M Performance Exhaust use the same tips as the M3/M4 MPP exhaust?A: Yes, they are interchangeable.Q: When will the M2 parts be available?A: The goal is for them to be available at launch, in April.[From Jason: the BMW M2 will have its world debut at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show in January, and first deliveries expected in April.  This has not been announced nor confirmed by BMW, but BIMMERPOST can confirm this schedule]._____________________________Updated 11/3 with live photos from SEMA 2015 of the BMW M2 M Performance Parts:We bring you live photos from SEMA 2015 of the BMW M2 M Performance Parts. The parts are being displayed apart from the M2 (which is not here) because the car has yet to receive its public debut, which will come at the Detroit Auto Show in January.We're putting together our Q&A / FAQ on the M2 M Performance Parts, so we'll have lots of great details and info to post very soon.For now, you can see the parts on display and we can also tell you that the M Performance suspension is a full coilover, 2-way adjustable (rebound and damping), with height adjustability from -5mm to -25mm.  You'll also notice that the front bumper will receive M Performance Winglets (as seen in the video presentation screenshots).  You also see the M Performance Steering Wheel fitted in the M4 interior, which is the same one that the M2 will receive.  The exhaust is stainless steel construction.  Again, we'll have much more details posted soon.BMW M2 M Performance Parts revealed at SEMA 2015November 3, 2015.The Speciality Equipment Market Association (SEMA) in Las Vegas (Nevada, USA) is regarded worldwide as the leading trade show for customisation and sports tuning. The new products presented at SEMA to trade experts influence the entire scene and set trends. At this year's SEMA show from November 3rd to 6th 2015, BMW presents a selection of distinctively sports-oriented BMW M Performance Parts to the trade fair audience. Located on the lower level of South Hall (Stand 40247), trade fair visitors will see a BMW M Performance modified BMW M4 Coupe (link to M4 parts announcement) as well as the first BMW M Performance Parts for the new BMW M2 Coupe.What is more, the new \"M Performance\" inscription in dynamic technical design is to be seen on selected parts. The inscription reflects the increased dynamic flair of BMW M Performance as well as underscoring the essential functional orientation of all BMW M Performance Parts. Evidence of this is also to be seen in the new, extremely sporty parts and components with which BMW has fitted the demonstration vehicle. The new inscription will initially appear on the BMW M Performance Parts for the models BMW M2 Coupe and BMW M4 Coupe, but in future it will be used for the entire BMW M Performance product portfolio.First BMW M Performance Parts for the new BMW M2 Coupe.Not long after the world premiere of the new BMW M2 Coupe, BMW now presents BMW M Performance Parts at SEMA 2015 which were developed especially for this compact high-performance athlete. These includeblack gloss trim grilleswith M specific twin trim bars for the front kidney grille elements, featuring trim ring surrounds which are likewise finished in black gloss. Black gloss trim bars are also available for the side M gill elements as well as BMW M Performance exterior mirror caps in carbon fibre.A BMW M Performancerear spoilerin carbon fibre finish, the newly developed BMW M Performancesuspensionand thesports exhaustwith flap system for the new BMW M2 Coupe withtailpipe trimelements in carbon fibre are exhibited at SEMA for the first time. Exhibits that demonstrate individualisation of the interior are a BMW M Performancesteering wheelwith Alcantara cover and an open-pore carbon fibre trim element, a BMW M Performancegear selection levercomplete withtrim elementfor the M twin-clutch transmission, likewise in open-pore carbon fibre, a BMW M Performancecentre consolecombining carbon fibre and Alcantara and pedal covers in stainless steel. Further details of BMW M Performance Parts for the new BMW M2 Coupe will be available in the course of spring 2016.BMW M2 M Performance Parts\n\nWould love to see these bits on a LBB variant.I'll take one of each, minus the stickers\n\nCan't wait to see everything tomorrow at SEMA\n\nSo, will there be a physical M2 there on display?\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything looks great except the vinyl and CF shift cover. As others have said I hope to see photos on the car. Not chopped like this but full shots of the car from different angles.P.s. That diffuser in CF looks really good.\n\nThat steering wheelThose little sideskirt extensions\n\nThe BMW M Performance Parts manager will be on hand at SEMA.Anyone have any questions?  Post them up if you do.\n\nWhy doesn't the M2 get a front lip?   I also wish it got full side things and not those little wings...but I will hold off judgment until I see the wings on a full picture of the car.\n\n\n\nAwesome! When will they be released?!\n\nGreat! I have a few:1. Will there be a M2 front lip M-performance part?2. Any more information you can share about the M-performance suspension? Adjustable (manual, electronically), different springs, different dampers?3. Is the exhaust flap adjustable remotely or opens based on a certain threshold?4. Any plans for a 'M Performance brakes' I.e Carbon ceramic brake package?\n\nI wonder what BMW calls the CF \"rear wheel winglets.\"\n\nNice easy way to make your M2 70K!\n\nThat steering wheel is awesome!!  Crap. haha looks like I am going to need to get that savings kicked into high gear.\n\nIs open pore carbon fiber just a fancy way of saying its dry carbon fiber with no coating on it?\n\nThat wheel is nice given the other Alcantara bits with the interior.My question:Is the steering wheel available for 6MT cars?\n\n\n\nThat steering wheel is freakin awesome!\n\n\n\nI only want the decklid spoiler.On another note...what color will the HVAC controls be.  One pic is orange and one pic is white.  I was hoping for white gauges throughout.  Is that a darker/deeper shade of orange gauges though?",

But doesn't matter because I will be putting Downpipes and MPE exhaust anyway.:\n\nGreat workswagon\n\nThat launch control sound clip sounds glorious. Car has a ton of grip.\n\n\n\nThat sound cloud clip would make a nice unusual ring tone.  Could we download it?!\n\nThe flatulence is still a bit much but its an overall improvement in sound over the F8x.\n\nNice! A growl with some bite.\n\nIt has a very minute amount of bass in the sound, which is very welcomed.Swagon, excellent find sir!\n\nm performance exhaust should make it sound even better\n\nI'm starting to want this baby M more than an M4 now.  Decisions decisions!\n\nIs it me or does the M2 sound a helluva lot better than the M3/4????  Seriously. Sounds great. Can't they do that for the M3/4?\n\nSounds like a N55 with the M Performance exhaust with slightly more bassy note which is a good thing.  Sounds way better than the M3/M4 honestly.Alan\n\nThe M2 sounds awesome.Thanks for the video swagon.\n\nDoes sound good. Will the M2 have the engine sound played through the speakers?\n\nAudio clip sounds like revving mashed with vag farts. Sounds in the video were vag free.\n\nVery very similar to the N55, which is an excellent place to start. Sounds fantastic, and a world ahead of the S55 which somehow sounds like a Pontiac 3800 V6.\n\n\n\n\n\nyea this sounds way better than m4",

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing. To cut weight as much as possible, the tuner says they are working on a carbon fiber roof while a Clubsport version is also planned with lightweight race seats , half or full roll cage as well as lightweight 19-inch OZ Superforgiata wheels wrapped around in 245/35R19 front and 265/35R19 rear tires.\"Source: worldcarfansHere you go..carbon fiber roof...also who doesnt like the fangs heres an alternative.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min. Furthermore you can read \"M Performance Twin Power Turbo\" and not \"M Twin Power Turbo\". The M2 won't be a \"M Performance\" 2 Series like the M235i, so this wouldn't match.And I talked with my source this morning and he said that he do notthinkthat this will be the M2 engine.\n\n^^  Agree.The '40i N55 engine is too limited at the top end RPM.  At least the 35i attains max power up to 6400rpm.The M2 version needs to beat this and hold more power to the redline to make it a satisfying drive as a M car.\n\nWe in germany speak at the moment of 272 KW / 370 PS for the upcoming M2. Several sources (quality, not AutoBild or something else..) say that.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nVery sad to see these M performance engines thrown under the hood of M cars.It was sad with the 1M, but excusable due to the lack of development time, however this time around it's just pathetic and inexcusable.\n\nThat's what we're getting and you guys better get used to it. I'm just hoping for adequate aftermarket tuning headroom. 420hp would do\n\n\n\nThis doesn't bother me at all.  Presumably, the M division is going to take the N55 and modify it to meet their standards.  The N55 is a great engine and will that much better once the M folk get done with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThink he's saying that the 1M had the identical engine from the Z4 35is so the M2 could very likely get the identical engine from the 40i cars..\n\nNone of this criticism will matter once people actually drive the car.\n\nIn October 2014 forum fellowynguldynalreadyindicatedthat the X4 M40i and M2 both will feature the N55B30T0 engine.\n\nY'all's complaints are ridiculous. You want spec sheet horsepower? Shut up and go buy a CTS-V.\n\nIt's really the same story over and over again. M3 with a turbo - outrage! M versions of X5 and X6 - outrage! 10 cylinder M5 - outrage! 8 cylinders in M5 again, but with a turbo - outrage!  When BMW announces an xdrive M car, it will be - you guessed it - outrage! all over again. And so on, ad infinitum.BTW that 1M with the \"excusable\" engine is a collectible now.\n\n\n\n",

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

It reaches the 360 PS at 5800 - 6000 U/min. That max output at 5800 - 6000 U/min is very low for a \"real\" M engine. The M4 reaches its max output between 5500 - 7300 U/min.

BMW installs a 155 mph (250 km/h) electronic speed limiter, but maybe Alpha-N Performance is willing to remove that to unlock the car?s full potential.Besides the healthy power boost, the M2 can get an adjustable coilover suspension and a more aerodynamic body kit made from carbon fiber which among others includes a four-position adjustable rear wing.
